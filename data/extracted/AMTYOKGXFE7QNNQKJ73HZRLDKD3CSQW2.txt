ABSTRACT
Utilizing word problems relevant to the data
processing field, this workbook presents a concept-oriented approach
to competency development in ten areas of basic mathematics:
(1) the
expression cf numbers as figures and words; (2) the multiplication,
addition, and division of whole numbers, fractions, and decimals:
(3)
ratios and proportions; (4)
percents:
(5) number systems;
(6)
measurement;
(7)
introductory algebra;
(8)
problem-solving;
(9)
statistics: and (10) illustrative aids such asgraphs, charts, and
tables. For each competency area, the workbook presents a series of
word problems designed to reinforce student learning and to
demonstrate the applicability of the concept to the data processing
work environment. An answer key for the exercises is appended.

number by repeated dividing by the base number, keeping
the remainders in order from the least significant to
the most significant digit.
