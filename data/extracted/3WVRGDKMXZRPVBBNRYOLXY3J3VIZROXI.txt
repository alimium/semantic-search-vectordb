The release of the 2004 Oregon Nursery and Greenhouse Survey results represents
the fifteenth year of documenting through statistics the progress of Oregon’s # 1
agricultural industry.  Nursery and greenhouse sales climbed to $ 844 million in 2004,
up 8 percent from the previous year, demonstrating that the industry continues to do an
outstanding job of growing and marketing high quality nursery stock and materials.
This growth continues despite the challenges of truck shortages, rising fuel,
transportation, and labor costs, sometimes burdensome regulations, and competition
for land.  The industry is a key generator of revenue for the State, with in excess of 75
percent of sales coming from outside Oregon.

Oregon’s top five producing counties Clackamas, Washington, Marion, Yamhill, and
Multnomah are in or near the Portland metropolitan area.  The nurseries and
greenhouses in these five counties represent 86 percent of the total value of production,
providing local employment and beautifying the urbanized landscape.
   in cooperation
   with Oregon
   Department
   of Agriculture
Container sales continue to dominate the product categories, accounting for 41 percent
of the sales for all product types; this share is up 3 percent from 2003.  Growth in sales
of container plants accounted for 72 percent of the $65 million increase realized by the
industry in 2004.
We would like to thank the many Oregon nurseries and greenhouses, the Oregon
Association of Nurseries, the Oregon Department of Agriculture, our crew of field
interviewers, and others who provide information and support for this important annual
effort.  Access to accurate and timely information is critical to the continued success of
this vital sector of Oregon agriculture.
Sincerely,

2004 Oregon nursery product sales set another record.
Oregon’s horticulture industries continued to grow in 2004 with another record high sales value of $844 million for nursery and
greenhouse products.  This was the fifteenth year of this survey and the fourteenth year of record sales.  Sales in 2004 climbed 8
percent above 2003 and were over 2  times the sales of 1995.  The horticulture industry continued to solidify its place above all other
Oregon agricultural commodities, claiming nearly 21 percent of the total value of agricultural production.  Cattle, with a value of $503
million, ranked second, while all hay and all milk claimed third and fourth places with sales of $382 million and $363 million,
respectively. 
Seventy-two percent of the total $65 million sales increase this year was in Container sales, which increased 16 percent over last
year, while Bare Root products gained 6 percent.  Each category of plant material sales was higher in 2004 than in 2003, except for
the other product category which remained the same as the previous year.
Gross sales, when broken down by sales size groups, showed increases in all but one group. The largest size group, 2+ million,
increased 12 percent or $67.3 million over 2003. This increased value  is more than the total increase  because the $500,000 to $2
million sales size group was down 3 percent to 5.1 million from last year. This size group was down in sales value because many of
these firms increased sales and moved into the 2+ million size group.

Firms with sales over $2 million made up 72.4 percent of all Oregon sales, and the total number of firms in this group increased 8 firms 
to a total of 84 firms.
Oregon’s top four counties of production, Clackamas, Washington, Marion, and Yamhill had with sales of $193.5 million, $191.2  million,
$178.9 million and $115.9 million, respectively. In  total, these four counties accounted  for 81 percent of all the sales. When Multnomah
county's  sales of $49.0 million is included, the total value of production in the top five counties account for 86 percent of total
production.  Clackamas county is still the major production area, but Marion county -- which has been the second largest county of
production -- was replaced by Washington county this year. Washington county sales were only 2.3 million below Clackamas county
and increased $27.5 million above last year. Given the number of growers and acres in production in Clackamas, Washington, and
Marion, counties, any of these three could be the number one producer next year.

Data collection
The 2004 Oregon Nursery and Greenhouse Survey was designed to collect data on all commercial nurseries, greenhouses, and
producers of other plant material, such as roses, holly, bulbs, sod, cut flowers, dried flowers, etc. in the State. A stratified random
sample of 752 names was selected from the State of Oregon’s list of licensed nurseries and greenhouses for 2004. They were
classified into six broad size groups based on sales volume. The Oregon Agricultural Statistics Service's floriculture survey was used to
supplement the list for those firms  who are not required to have a State license.
Questionnaires were mailed to the sampled names on June 13, 2005, followed by a second request on July 7. All non-respondents
were phoned or visited from July 27 to August 18. Cooperation was excellent with 92 percent of the sampled names partaicipating in
the survey.  Data for minor counties and items were combined with other totals to avoid disclosure of individual operations.
The sample design was developed by the National Agricultural Statistics Service. Kent Hoddick of the Oregon Staff has been the
survey coordinator of the Oregon Nursery and Greenhouse program since its inception in 1991.

The number of workers employed increased 6 percent from 2001 to a total of 21,600.  Each sales size group reflected part of that
increase except the “$200,000-$499,999" size group, which dropped 400 workers, a decline of 22 percent from the 2001 survey.  While
the total wages paid rose 18 percent to a total of $275.2 million, the State average wage paid to workers only rose by 11.8 percent or to
$12,741 dollars.  Full time worker numbers continued upward, reaching 10,000 for 2003.  Seasonal worker numbers, after two surveys
of declining numbers,  increased  by  7  percent  to  11,600  workers  for  2003.   Both  seasonal  and  full  time  worker  numbers 
declined  for  the “$200,000-$499,999" sales size group since the 2001 survey.
