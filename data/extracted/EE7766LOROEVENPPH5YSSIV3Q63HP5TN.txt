Paso Post Office Should Honor Our Troops
    
ATASCADERO, CA – Today, in response to the Paso Robles Post Office’s removal of pictures
commemorating our troops bravely serving abroad, Congressman McCarthy issued the
following statement:
  
“Supporting our local heroes’ bravery and sacrifice is common sense.  That is why I am troubled
with the Paso Robles Post Office’s removal of pictures honoring the sacrifice of our brave men
and women serving in the Armed Services.  I am in contact with the Postal Service to get a
clear answer of why this happened and determine what actions can be taken.”
