- Virginia’s NSP Turning Foreclosed Homes into  
Homeowner Opportunities -  
Interested homebuyers may receive closing cost and other assistance 
 
Richmond, VA – Virginia’s Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP) is turning vacant, foreclosed 
and potentially blighting homes into homeownership opportunities for Virginia’s low, moderate and 
middle income families. 
 
“The NSP has provided an opportunity for communities to address the impacts of foreclosure, to 
stabilize home prices, and prevent homes from becoming sources of blight,” said DHCD Director Bill 
Shelton.  “However the program is also focused on making these homes available for low, moderate 
and middle income families.” 
 
Area homebuyers earning up to 120 percent of the area median income are encouraged to find out if 
they are eligible.  Eligible homebuyers may receive closing cost and other assistance to help make the 
homes affordable.  NSP funds must be used by September 17, 2010, and prospective homebuyers are 
urged to contact NSP grantees to find out more.  Many grantees are now concentrating on identifying 
and qualifying eligible homebuyers in those areas of Virginia served by the NSP. 
 
NSP grantees are providing assistance in the following areas of the Commonwealth: 
 
Northern Virginia: Alexandria, Loudoun, Fauquier, Fairfax, Stafford, Prince William, Manassas, 
Fredericksburg, Caroline, Spotsylvania, Culpeper, Orange 
 
Central Virginia: Richmond City, Chesterfield, Louisa, Lynchburg, Petersburg 
 
Tidewater/Hampton Roads: Newport News, Hampton, Norfolk, Chesapeake, Suffolk, 
Portsmouth, Virginia Beach  
 
Northern Shenandoah:  Warren, Frederick, Shenandoah, Winchester  
 
Southside: Franklin County, Danville 
 
Southwest:  Bristol  
 
Through the NSP, 22 local government and nonprofit organizations have been working to acquire 
foreclosed properties at a discounted rate, rehabilitate them and make them available for resale to 
qualified homebuyers earning up to 120 percent of the area median income.   
The NSP was authorized under the Housing and Economic Recovery Act (HERA) of 2008 to provide 
emergency assistance to state and local governments in acquiring and redeveloping vacant and foreclosed 
properties that might otherwise become sources of abandonment and blight within their communities.

The Virginia Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD) is administering Virginia’s 
NSP, and has received $38.7 million in funding from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban 
Development for this program. Grant funds have been allocated through DHCD to local governments and 
certified nonprofits, which are negotiating the purchase of homes.  All properties must be acquired at a 
minimum of one percent below as-is appraised value.  
To-date, approximately 70 homes have been purchased by grantees through the program, with many more 
to follow.  More information about this program can be obtained by contacting the Virginia NSP 
administrator in your area of interest.
