4. Description of the Proposed Action 
The action requested in this notification is to allow the safe use of a rubber-modified polysty- 
rene copolymer as a component of food-contact articles, for all food types. This rubber-modi- 
fied polystyrene copolymer is comparable to polymers described in 21 CFR ยง177.1810 
(3)(b)(l .i) but differs with respect to the Tgl due to the random PSB - mid-block. 
More specifically, the polymer, which is the subject of this notification is a rubber-modified 
polystyrene resin prepared by the polymerization of 1,3-butadiene and styrene such that the 
resulting product contains between 60 to 75 % by weight of polymer units derived from styrene 
0 
monomer. The rubber-modified polystyrene copolymer is referred to herein-after as: 
Styroflex@. 
Styroflex@ is composed of two polystyrene block end caps, and a randomized copolybutadi- 
enektyrene mid-block. The random block functions by improving the elongation properties of 
the polymer, thus conveying high elasticity to the finished article. Accordingly, the polymer is 
expected to be employed primarily in the production of food-contact articles that require the 
clarity of general-purpose polystyrene and an improved the elasticity. Articles that may be 
prepared with the use of the polymer include such items as films or coatings for food-contact 
use. Styroflex@ is expected to compete in these applications primarily with high impact polysty- 
rene (HIPS), where a high elasticity is required, and to a degree with plasticized PVC cling 
films. While Styroflex@ exhibits a desirable combination of elasticity and clarity, it is essentially

A t t a c h m e n t  X l l l  
similar in technical properties to HIPS. Consequently, the notification as proposed is expected 
to open new markets for styrene block polymers in the area of food packaging. 
The above-mentioned use as coating might be a minor application in future where only negli- 
gible amounts will be used. The effect on the environment will not substantially differ whether 
the FCS is used as a film or as an even thinner coating. For this reasons it is not separately 
considered in the following assessment 
Rather, in those applications for which HIPS polymers are technologically suited, Styroflex@ is 
expected to replace HIPS-based polymers with less desirable overall characteristics. However 
the availability of Styroflex* may increase the percentage of the market packaged in styrene- 
based polymers only by insignificant amounts, because the scheduled amount of Styroflex@ to 
be used in food contact applications will be                                   , which is                            of 
the market volume of HIPS polymers. As noted above, in light of the similarity of the polymer 
to currently cleared styrene block polymers, new food packaging applications which previously 
have been made of HIPS are expected as a result of the use of StyroflexB. 
In addition, BASF Aktiengesellschaft has determined that the random block improves 
processing characteristics of the polymers, thus leading to lower rejection rates of finished 
articles. Considering also the difference in mechanical properties between StyroflexB and 
HIPS, the use of Styroflex@ as proposed could lead to a reduction in the mass of polymer 
needed for certain applications. 
The polymer will be manufactured by the Notifier at its production facilities located in Ludwigs- 
hafen (Germany), Antwerp (Belgium), and Altamira (Mexico). The Notifier does not manufac- 
ture finished food-contact articles containing the resin; rather, it will sell resin to compounders 
or to processors that are involved in the manufacture of food-contact articles. Thus, the co- 
polymer is expected to be used by film producers at a number of different production sites 
throughout the United States. Food-contact materials containing Styroflex@ will be used in 
patterns corresponding to national population density, and will be widely distributed across the 
country. Consequently, it is expected that disposal will occur nationwide, with about 20% of 
the materials ultimately being incinerated, according to current Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA) projections, and with 80% being disposed of by means of sanitary landfill or, to 
some extent, by recycling.

6. Introduction of Substances Into the Environment 
Notifier considers the details of its manufacturing process for Styroflex@ to ,e 
a valuable trade 
secret. In accordance with 21 C.F.R.5 25.30(b), this information is provided in Section A of this 
notification, not as a part of the Environmental Assessment. The information included in Sec- 
tion A should be protected from unauthorized disclosure in accordance with FDA's Public In- 
a 
formation Regulations. 
To summarize the information provided in Section A, the subject polymer is produced by the 
reaction of a mixture of styrene and 1,3 butadiene. The reaction is carried out by polymeriza- 
tion of the monomers dissolved in a hydrocarbon solvent. The polymer consists of two poly- 
styrene end blocks and a randomized copolybutadiene styrene middle block. The polymer 
contains a mixture of stabilizers that are cleared for use in all polymers. 
' 
We have determined that no extraordinary circumstances apply to the manufacture of the 
food-contact substance. Therefore, information regarding production of the food-contact sub- 
stance is not provided. 
Disposal by the ultimate consumer of food packaging materials containing StyroflexB will be 
by conventional rubbish disposal and, hence, by sanitary landfill or incineration. 
The rubber-modified polystyrene copolymer is prepared from only carbon and hydrogen con- 
taining materials. Thus, no toxic combustion products are expected as a result of the incinera- 
tion of this product in a properly operated incinerator.

A t t a c h m e n t  X l l l  
When food-packaging materials containing Styroflex@ are added to sanitary landfills, no sig- 
nificant amount of leaching of either oligomeric components or the subject stabilizer from 
these materials into the environment is anticipated because of a lack of solubility in water. 
7. Fate of Emitted Substances in the Environment 
(a) Air 
No significant effect on the concentrations and exposures to any substances in the atmos- 
phere are anticipated due to the proposed use of Styroflex@. 
The manufacture of Styroflex@ generates as waste stream activated carbon charged with in- 
organic and organic compounds. This waste stream is sent to a licensed industrial waste 
treatment facility for incineration. Consequently, no significant volatile emissions are antici- 
pated at the site of production of the rubber-modified polystyrene copolymer. 
a 
Moreover, the polymer per se is of high molecular weight and does not volatilize. As discussed 
in Item 5 above, residual monomer levels are extremely low. Finally, the products of complete 
combustion of the polymer are carbon dioxide and water; the concentrations of these sub- 
stances in the environment would not be significantly altered by the proper incineration of the 
polymer in the amounts utilized for food packaging applications. 
(b) Water 
No significant effects on the concentrations and exposures to any substances in fresh water, 
e 
estuarine, or marine ecosystems are anticipated due to the proposed use of the subject co- 
polymer. We expect that the information, which will be provided later in Item 6 of this Environ- 
mental Assessment demonstrate that no substance will be emitted to aqueous compartments 
of the environment at levels that could cause any adverse environmental impact. More specifi- 
0 
cally, all wastewater from the production of is collected and treated in a central facility. Sam- 
pling of the wastewater occurs 24 hours a day to ensure compliance with the applicable dis- 
charge permits. No significant quantities of any substance will be added to these water sys- 
tems upon the proper incineration of the polymer, nor upon its disposal in landfills. 
(c) Land 
Considering the factors discussed above, no significant effects on the concentrations and ex- 
posures to any substances in terrestrial ecosystems are anticipated as a result of the pro- 
posed use of In particular, the extremely low levels of migration of polymer constituents dem- 
onstrated by the extraction studies indicates that virtually no leaching of these substances 
may be expected to occur, either when small quantities of plant scrap or larger amounts of 
a

A t t a c h m e n t  X l l l  
finished packaging materials are disposed of. Thus, there is no expectation of any meaningful 
exposure of terrestrial organisms to these substances as a result of the proposed use of 
8. Environmental Effects of Released .Substances 
a 
As discussed previously, substances that may be released to the environment upon the use 
and disposal of food packaging materials containing include minute levels of oligomeric spe- 
cies and/or stabilizers from the landfilling of materials containing the additive, and small quan- 
tities of carbon dioxide and water from its incineration. No constituents of the copolymer may 
reasonably be expected to leach at more than trace levels from finished packaging materials 
placed in landfill sites. 
Since the substance is not expected to leach significantly from finished packaging materials 
deposited in landfill sites, and since it is of such a low order of toxicity, Notifier respectfully 
submits that no adverse environmental impact can reasonably be anticipated from substances 
released as a result of the proposed use and subsequent disposal of the subject polymer. 
' 
9. Use of Resources and Energy 
As is the case with other food-packaging materials, the production, use and disposal of 
Styroflex@ involves the use of natural resources such as petroleum products, coal, and the 
like. However, the manufacture of the subject polymer will not result in an increase in the use 
0 
of such natural resources since the product is intended to compete with and replace HIPS 
other rubber-modified polystyrene copolymers currently on the market for use in food pack- 
aging applications, which require the expenditure of the same or similar quantities of re- 
sources to produce. Furthermore, the use of the subject resin in food-contact articles will not 
significantly alter the applications for which such articles are suitable. 
The use of Styroflex@ is also not expected to have any impact on current or future recycling 
efforts. The polymer is expected to be used primarily or solely in food packaging applications 
that currently employ styrene-based polymers, including such articles as meat trays, egg car- 
tons, and food packaging film. To the extent that currently cleared rubber-modified polystyrene 
is recycled after consumer use, is equally recyclable with this material since the polymers are 
identical with the exception of a slight difference in comonomer ratios. Moreover, is not ex- 
pected to compete with non-styrene based polymers or other materials in applications in which 
the currently used materials are widely recycled. For example, the subject polymer is not ex- 
pected to replace glass bottles or jars, aluminum cans, polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bot- 
tles for carbonated beverages, or high-density polyethylene milk jugs.

A t t a c h m e n t  X l l l  
As discussed previously, Styroflex@ exhibits improved processing characteristics over those of 
traditional polystyrene. Consequently, somewhat lower rates of rejection, and lower volumes 
of plant scrap, may be expected upon the use of the polymer, resulting in additional savings in 
resource and energy consumption. For all these reasons, approval of this notification is not 
expected to have any adverse impact on the use of natural resources and energy. 
10. Mitigation Measures 
As shown above, no significant effects on the environment are anticipated from the use and 
disposal of articles containing the subject polymer. This is primarily due to the low toxicity of 
the polymer and the low levels of migration of polymer constituents as shown in Section B of 
the notification, as well as the close similarity between Styroflex@ and the currently cleared sty- 
@ 
rene-based polymers with which it is intended to compete. Thus, the use of the FCS as pro- 
posed is not reasonably expected to result in any new environmental problem requiring miti- 
gation measures of any kind. 
11. Alternatives to the Proposed Action 
No potential adverse environmental effects are identified herein which would necessitate al- 
ternative actions to that proposed in this notification. The alternative of not approving the ac- 
a 
tion proposed herein would simply result in the continued use of currently cleared HIPS poly- 
mers; such action would have no environmental impact. However, in view of the excellent 
qualities of the Styroflex@ for food packaging, the fact that resin components are not expected 
to migrate in more than minuscule amounts from finished food packaging materials into food 
or into land in which such containers are disposed, and the absence of any significant envi- 
0 
ronmental impact which would result from its use, allowing this notification to become effective 
to permit the safe use of Styroflex@ as a component of articles intended for use in contact with 
food is environmentally safe in every respect.
