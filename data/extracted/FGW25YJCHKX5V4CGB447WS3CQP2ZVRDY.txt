SCHAKOWSKY: BUSH ADMINISTRATION'S MISSTATEMENT OF THE DAY -  ENERGY
LEGISLATION
  
WASHINGTON, D.C. - U.S. Representative Jan Schakowsky (D-IL) issued today's "Bush
Administration's Misstatement of the Day" on energy legislation.   
 
  
Speaking about our nation's need for an energy policy, President Bush said:
    
"America must have an energy policy that plans for the future, but meets the needs of
today.   I believe we can develop our natural resources and protect our environment."
(President George W. Bush from the White House Webpage - Energy Policy Section)  
However, the energy bill just passed by the House of Representatives today endangers
the environment and fails to put forward a comprehensive energy plan for America's
future.    Nonetheless, the White House has indicated that the President will sign the bill.
  
Read about H.R. 6, the energy conference report passed by the House.
