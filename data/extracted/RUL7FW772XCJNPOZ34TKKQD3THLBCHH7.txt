SUBJ:  
United States Standard for Helicopter Area Navigation (RNAV) 
 
These criteria are the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) standards for developing 
helicopter area navigation (RNAV) instrument procedure construction based on Global 
Positioning System (GPS). This revision adds definitions, changes procedure identification 
from GPS to RNAV, provides specific holding pattern leg lengths, helicopter en route criteria, 
decreases navigation system error tolerance for along-track distance in the terminal area, 
and adds departure criteria, minimums, and requirements. The types of final approaches 
have been revised. They are Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) to an IFR heliport, IFR to a Visual 
Flight Rules (VFR) heliport (Proceed Visually), Point-in-Space (PinS) approach (Proceed 
VFR), and IFR to Runways with separate criteria for each.   
 
The first step to increase helicopter IFR utility is the development of helicopter RNAV 
instrument procedures. Ongoing testing and criteria development by the FAA for application 
of the Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) will provide the next major step. WAAS with 
its increased integrity and 3-dimensional (3D) approach capability will allow narrower route 
widths and approaches with vertical guidance (APV).

Chapter 2. General Criteria 
 
Section 1. Basic Criteria Information 
2-1. 
General. These criteria assume use of Global Positioning System (GPS) or Wide Area 
Augmentation System (WAAS) receivers approved for approach operations, in accordance with 
Advisory Circular (AC) 20-138, Airworthiness Approval of Global Navigation Satellite System 
(GNSS) Equipment; Technical Standard Order (TSO) C-129 Class A (1) systems; and 
AC 20-130, Airworthiness Approval of Navigation or Flight Management Systems Integrating 
Multiple Navigation Sensors, for GPS as part of a multi-sensor system meeting TSO-C129 
Class C (1) System or pertinent military guidance. Advisory Circular (AC) 20-138C, 
Airworthiness Approval of Positioning and Navigation Systems, and Technical Standard Order 
(TSO) C196A, Airborne Supplemental Navigation Sensors for Global Positioning System 
Equipment using Aircraft-Based Augmentation, contain updated Airworthiness guidance. 
WAAS navigation equipment must be approved in accordance with the requirements specified in 
TSO-C145, Airborne Navigation Sensors Using the Global Positioning System (GPS) 
Augmented by the Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS), or TSO-C146, Stand-Alone 
Airborne Navigation Equipment Using the Global Positioning System (GPS) Augmented by the 
Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS). 
Unless otherwise specified, Order 8260.3, United States Standard for Terminal Instrument 
Procedures (TERPS), applies. For public use procedures, the heliport must meet the guidance 
contained in AC 150/5390-2, Heliport Design. Obstacle clearance area dimensions are based on 
90 knots indicated airspeed (KIAS) maximum in the initial and intermediate segments and 
70 KIAS maximum in the final and missed approach segments until passing the missed approach 
holding fix. USA/USAF/USN/USCG only:  procedures are designed for 90 KIAS in the final and 
missed approach segments. 
The following FAA orders apply: 
 7130.3, Holding Pattern Criteria. 
 8260.3, United States Standard for Terminal Instrument Procedures (TERPS). 
 8260.19, Flight Procedures and Airspace. 
Apply chapter 2, section 3 of Order 7130.3, Holding Pattern Criteria. Use pattern 4 for all 
helicopter holding (including climb-in-hold) up to and including 10,000 ft. Chart 4 nautical mile 
(NM) leg lengths. 
The feeder, initial, intermediate, final, and missed approach criteria described in this order 
supersede the other publications listed above. See Order 8260.3, Volume 1, chapter 3 to 
determine visibility minima. 
Formulas are numbered by chapter and depicted in standard mathematical notation and in 
standard text to aid in computer programming. Each formula contains a java script functional 
calculator.

Data Resolution. Perform calculations using an accuracy of at least 15 significant digits; 
i.e., floating point numbers must be stored using at least 64 bits. Unless otherwise noted, do not 
round intermediate results. Round only the final result of calculations for documentation 
purposes. Required accuracy tolerance is 1 centimeter for distance and 0.002 arc-second for 
angles. The following list specifies the minimum accuracy standard for documenting data 
expressed numerically. This standard applies to the documentation of final results only; e.g., a 
calculated adjusted glidepath angle of 3.04178 degrees is documented as 3.05 degrees. The 
standard does not apply to the use of variable values during calculation. Use the most accurate 
data available for variable values. 
a. Documentation Accuracy: 
(1) WGS-84 latitudes and longitudes to the nearest one hundredth (0.01) arc second; 
[nearest five ten thousandth (0.0005) arc second for Final Approach Segment (FAS) data block 
entries]; 
(2) Flight Path Alignment Point (FPAP) mean sea level (MSL) elevation to the nearest 
foot; 
(3) FPAP height above ellipsoid (HAE) to the nearest tenth (0.1) meter; 
(4) Glidepath angle to the next higher one hundredth (0.01) degree; 
(5) Courses to the nearest one hundredth (0.01) degree;  
(6) Course width at threshold to the nearest quarter (0.25) meter; and 
(7) Distances to the nearest hundredth (0.01) unit [except for “length of offset” entry in 
FAS data block which is to the nearest 8 meter value].

Notes on calculator usage: 
 
1.  Most calculators are programmed with these rules of precedence. 
 
2.  When possible, let the calculator maintain all of the available digits of a number 
in memory rather than re-entering a rounded number.  For highest accuracy from a 
calculator, any rounding that is necessary should be done at the latest opportunity. 
 
 
c. Geospatial Standards.  The following standards apply to the evaluation of obstacle and 
terrain position and elevation data relative to RNAV OEAs and OCSs.  Terrain and obstacle data 
are reported in NAD-83 latitude, longitude, and elevation relative to MSL in National Geodetic 
Vertical Datum of 1929 (NGVD-29) or North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD-88) 
vertical datum.  Evaluate obstacles using their NAD-83 horizontal position and NAVD-88 
elevation value compared to the WGS-84 referenced course centerline (along-track and cross-
track), OEA boundaries, and OCS elevations as appropriate. 
 
 
 
(1) WGS-84[G873] for Position and Course Construction.  This reference frame is used 
by the FAA and the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD).  It is defined by the National 
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) (formerly the National Imagery and Mapping Agency, 
formerly the Defense Mapping Agency [DMA]).  In 1986, the Office of National Geodetic 
Survey (NGS), redefined and readjusted the North American Datum of 1927 (NAD-27), creating 
the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD-83).  The WGS-84 was defined by the DMA.  Both 
NAD-83 and WGS-84 were originally defined (in words) to be geocentric and oriented as the 
Bureau International d I’Heure (BIH) Terrestrial System.  In principle, the three-dimensional 
(3D) coordinates of a single physical point should be the same in both NAD-83 and WGS-84 
Systems; in practice; however, small differences are sometimes found.  The original intent was 
that both systems would use the Geodetic Reference System of 1980 (GRS-80) as a reference 
ellipsoid.  As it happened, the WGS-84 ellipsoid differs very slightly from GRS-80.  The 
difference is 0.0001 meters in the semi-minor axis.  In January 2, 1994, the WGS-84 reference 
system was realigned to be compatible with the International Earth Rotation Service’s Terrestrial 
Reference Frame of 1992 (ITRF) and renamed WGS-84 (G730).  The reference system 
underwent subsequent improvements in 1996, referenced as WGS-84 (G873) closely aligned 
with ITRF-94, to the current realization adopted by the NGA in 2001, referenced as WGS-84 
(G1150) and considered equivalent systems to ITRF 2000. 
 
 
 
(2) NAVD-88 for elevation values.  NAVD-88 is the vertical control datum established 
in 1991 by the minimum-constraint adjustment of the Canadian-Mexican-U.S. leveling 
observations.  It held fixed the height of the primary tidal bench mark, referenced to the new 
International Great Lakes Datum of 1985 local MSL height value, at Father Point/Rimouski, 
Quebec, Canada.  Additional tidal bench mark elevations were not used due to the demonstrated 
variations in sea surface topography, (i.e., the fact that MSL is not the same equipotential surface 
at all tidal bench marks).

d. OEA Construction and Obstacle Evaluation Methodology. 
 
 
 
(1) Courses, fixes, boundaries (lateral dimension).  Construct straight-line courses as a 
WGS-84 ellipsoid geodesic path.  If the course outbound from a fix differs from the course 
inbound to the fix (courses measured at the fix), then a turn is indicated.  Construct parallel and 
trapezoidal boundary lines as a locus of points measured perpendicular to the geodesic path.  
(The resulting primary and/or secondary boundary lines do not display a “middle bulge” due to 
curvature of the ellipsoids surface since they are not geodesic paths.)  NAD-83 latitude/longitude 
positions are acceptable for obstacle, terrain, and airport data evaluation.  Determine obstacle 
lateral positions relative to course centerline/OEA boundaries using ellipsoidal calculations (see 
appendix B). 
 
 
 
(2) Elevations (vertical dimension).  Evaluate obstacles, terrain, and airport data using 
their elevation relative to their orthometric height above the geoid (for our purposes, MSL) 
referenced to the NAVD-88 vertical datum.  The elevations of OCSs are determined spherically 
relative to their origin MSL elevation (NAVD-88).  Department of Defense (DoD) procedure 
developers may use EGM-96 vertical datum. 
 
 
e. Evaluation of Actual and Assumed Obstacles (AAO).  Apply the vertical and 
horizontal accuracy standards in Order 8260.19, paragraphs 272, 273, 274, and appendix 3.  
(USAF, apply guidance per AFI 11-230) 
 
Note:  When applying an assumed canopy height consistent with local area 
vegetation, contact the FAA regional Flight Procedures Office (FPO) to verify the 
height value to use. 
 
 
f. ATT Values.  ATT is the value used (for segment construction purposes) to quantify 
position uncertainty of an RNAV fix.  The application of ATT can; therefore, be considered 
“circular;” i.e., the ATT value assigned describes a radius around the plotted position of the 
RNAV fix (see figure 2-1 and table 2-1).

Note:  Cross-track tolerance (XTT) values were considered in determining minimum 
segment widths, and are not considered further in segment construction.

3. Procedure Identification.  GPS and WAAS are considered to be RNAV systems.  The 
procedure identification begins with “COPTER RNAV (GPS).”  The remainder of the 
identification is based on whether the landing site is a heliport or a runway. 
 
 
a. U.S. Army (USA) Helicopter Runways.  USA heliports that have helicopter runways 
chart the procedure with the letter H and the runway number.  To differentiate between parallel 
runways, use the letter “L” or “R”; i.e., COPTER RNAV (GPS) RWY H22R. 
 
 
b. IFR Approach to an IFR Runway (within 30 degrees alignment).  Use the 
abbreviation “RWY” followed by the runway number.  Examples:  COPTER RNAV (GPS) 
RWY 22. 
 
 
c. Point-in-Space (PinS) or IVH procedures to a VFR Runway.  Use the magnetic 
bearing of the final approach course.  Example:  COPTER RNAV (GPS) 160°. 
 
 
d. Multiple Procedures to the Same Runway.  Where more than one approach, using the 
same final approach guidance is developed to the same location, identify each location/guidance 
combination with an alphabetical suffix beginning at the end of the alphabet; e.g., COPTER 
RNAV (GPS) Z RWY 22 (first procedure), COPTER RNAV (GPS) Y RWY 22 (second 
procedure), COPTER RNAV (GPS) X RWY 22 (third procedure).  Identify the procedure with 
the lowest minimums will be identified with “Z” and the next lowest “Y.” 
 
 
e. Special Approach Procedures.  A procedure requires special authorization when it is an 
instrument flight rules (IFR) approach to a visual flight rules (VFR) heliport, reference chapter 4, 
paragraph 5, or one of the following conditions exists:  (USAF/USA/USCG/USN not 
applicable). 
 
 
 
(1) A track change at the precise final approach fix (PFAF) exceeds 30 degrees. 
 
 
 
(2) Descent Gradient/Angle exceeds 600 ft/NM (5.64 degrees) on any IFR segment. 
 
 
 
(3) When raising the helipoint crossing height (HCH) to greater than 10 ft in the visual 
segment. 
 
2-7 
03/10/2009 
 
8260.42B 
 
 
(4) When a Vmini less than 70 knots indicated airspeed (KIAS) is applied. 
 
 
 
(5) Where a bank angle other than the standard is used. 
 
 
 
(6) When the missed approach point (MAP) to helipoint distance is less than 3,342 ft 
(0.55 NM). 
 
Note:  This criterion applies only to an IFR to a VFR heliport (IVH) procedure. 
 
4. Segment Width (General).  Table 2-2 lists primary and secondary width values for all 
segments of an RNAV approach procedure.  Where segments cross* a point 30 NM from airport 
reference point (HRP), segment primary area width increases (expansion) or decreases (taper) at 
a rate of 30 degrees relative to course to the appropriate width.  Secondary area expansion/taper 
is a straight-line connection from the point the primary area begins expansion/taper to the point 
the primary area expansion/taper ends.  Reference to route width values is often specified as NM 
values measured from secondary area edge across the primary area to the secondary edge at the 
other side.  For example, route width for segments more than 30 NM from HRP is “1-3-3-1.”  
See figures 2-2b and 2-2c.  For distances ≤ 30 NM, the width is “0.5-1.5-1.5-0.5.”  See table 2-2 
and figure 2-2a. 
 
*Note:  Feeder segment width is 1-3-3-1 at all distances greater than 30 NM from HRP.  A 
segment designed to cross within 30 NM of the HRP more than once does not taper in width 
until the 30 NM limit is crossed for approach and landing; i.e., crosses the limit for the last 
time before landing.  A missed approach segment designed to cross a point 30 NM of the HRP 
more than once expands when it crosses the boundary the first time and remains expanded.

OEA can taper inward at a rate of 30 degrees relative to course from ± 3 NM to ± 1.5 NM.  The 
secondary area tapers from a 1 NM width when the 30 NM point is crossed to a 0.5 NM width 
abeam the point the primary area reaches the ± 1.5 NM width.  The total along-track distance 
required to complete the taper is approximately 1.73 NM (10,524.14 ft).  Segment width tapers 
regardless of fix location within the tapering section unless a turn is associated with the fix.  
Delay OEA taper until the turn is complete and normal OEA turn construction is possible (see 
figure 2-3a).

(2) Width Changes at 30 NM from HRP/ARP (RF).  When the approach segment 
crosses the point 30 NM from airport reference point in an RF leg, construct the leg beginning at 
a width of 1-3-3-1 prior to the 30 NM point and taper to 0.5-1.5-1.5-0.5 NM width inside the 
30 NM point.  Calculate the perpendicular distance (Bprimary, Bsecondary) from the RF segment track 
centerline to primary and secondary boundaries at any along-track distance (specified as degrees 
of RF arc “α”) from the point the track crosses the 30 NM point using formula 2-1 (see figure

5. Calculating the Turn Radius (R).  The design turn radius value is based on four variables:  
indicated airspeed, assumed tailwind, altitude, and bank angle.  Calculate R using formula 2-3c. 
Apply the indicated airspeed from table 2-3 for the highest speed helicopter category that will be 
published on the approach procedure.  Apply the highest expected turn altitude value.  Apply the 
appropriate bank angle from table 2-4 and formula 2-2 to determine the vertical path altitude 
(VPalt).

Note:  Determine the highest altitude within a turn by: 
 
For approach –calculate the vertical path altitude (VPalt) by projecting a 3-degree 
vertical path from the PFAF along the designed nominal flight track to the turn fix. 
 
For missed approach highest altitude in a turn, apply (a) or (b), and (c). 
 
(a) Turn-At-A-Fix, project a vertical path along the nominal flight track from the SOC 
point and altitude to the turn fix, that rises at a rate of 400 ft/NM (Helicopter) or a 
higher rate if a steeper climb gradient is specified.  Compare the vertical path altitude at 
the fix to the minimum published fix altitude, apply the higher of the two; 
 
(b) Turn-At-An-Altitude, apply the climb-to-altitude; 
 
(c) Plus an additive, (Turn-At-A-Fix (FO) and Turn-At-An-Altitude) based on a 
continuous climb of 400 ft per 12 degrees of turn [ φ*400/12 ]).  The turn altitude must 
not be higher than the published missed approach altitude. 
 
Helicopter example:  900 ft would be added for a turn of 27 degrees, 767 ft would be 
added for 23 degrees, 333 ft for 10 degrees of turn. 
 
Step 1:  Determine the true airspeed (KTAS) for the turn using formula 2-3a.  Locate and use the 
appropriate knots indicated airspeed (KIAS) from table 2-3.  Use the highest altitude within the 
turn.

Step 1:  Determine R.  See formula 2-3c. 
 
 
Step 2:  Determine rr.  See formula 2-4a or formula 2-4b. 
 
 
Step 3:  Establish the baseline for construction of the turn expansion area as the line 
perpendicular to the inbound track at a distance past the turn fix equal to (ATT+rr). 
 
 
Step 4:  On the baseline, locate the center points for the primary and secondary turn 
boundaries.  The first is located at a distance R from the non-turning side primary boundary.  The 
second is located at a distance R from the turning side secondary boundary (see figures 2-4 and 
2-5). 
 
 
Step 5:  From these center points construct arcs for the primary boundary of radius R.  
Complete the secondary boundary by constructing additional arcs of radius (R+WS) from the 
same center points.  (WS=width of the secondary).  This is shown in figures 2-4 and 2-5.

Step 6:  The arcs constructed in step 5 are tangent to the outer boundary lines of the 
inbound segment.  Construct lines tangent to the arcs based on the first turn point tapering 
inward at an angle of 30 degrees relative to the outbound track that joins the arc primary and 
secondary boundaries.  If both the inner and outer arcs lie outside subsequent segment boundary 
lines, but the resulting tapering line tangent points lie inside the subsequent segment boundary 
lines, consider the expanded boundary connection points to be the intersection of the arc and the 
subsequent segment boundary lines.  If the arcs from the second turn point are inside the tapering 
lines as shown in figure 2-4, then they are disregarded and the expanded area construction is 
completed.  If not, proceed to step 7.

Step 1:  Establish a line through the turn fix that bisects the turn angle.  Determine Turn 
Radius (R).  See formula 2-3c.  Scribe an arc (with origin on bisector line) of radius R tangent to 
inbound and outbound courses.  This is the designed turning flight path.

R+1.0 NM). 
 
 
 
Step 3:  Scribe an arc that is tangent to the inner secondary boundaries of the two 
segment legs using the origin and radius from step 2 minus the secondary width. 
 
 
 
Step 4:  Scribe the primary area outer turning boundary with an arc with a radius equal to

c. Radius-to-Fix (RF) Turn.  Incorporation of an RF segment may limit the number of 
aircraft served by the procedure.  RF legs are used to control the ground track of a turn where 
obstructions prevent the design of a fly-by or fly-over turn, or to accommodate other operational 
requirements.*  The curved leg begins tangent to the previous segment course at its terminating 
fix and ends tangent to the next segment course at its beginning fix (see figure 2-7).  OEA 
construction limits turn radius to a minimum value equal-to or greater-than the OEA (primary 
and secondary) half-width.  The RF segment OEA boundaries are parallel arcs. 
 
*Note:  RF legs segments are not applicable to the final segment or section 1 of the 
missed approach segment.  RF legs in the intermediate segment must terminate at 
least 2 NM prior to the PFAF.  Where RF legs are used, annotate the procedure (or 
segment as appropriate) “RF Required.”  Use Order 8260.52, table 1-3 for VKTW 
values for radius calculations for RF legs. 
 
 
 
Step 1:  Determine the segment turn radius (R) that is required to fit the geometry of the 
terrain/airspace.  Enter the required radius value into formula 2-8 to verify the resultant bank 
angle is ≤ 20 degrees (maximum allowable bank angle).  Where a bank angle other than standard 
is used, annotate the value in the remarks section of the FAA Form 8260-9 or appropriate 
military procedure documentation form.

8. Feeder Segment.  When the initial approach fix (IAF) is not part of the en route structure, it 
may be necessary to designate feeder routes from the en route structure to the IAF.  The feeder 
segment may contain a sequence of TF segments (and/or RF segments).  The maximum course 
2-27 
03/10/2009 
 
8260.42B 
 
change between TF segments is 90 degrees (70 degrees preferred).  Formula 2-3c note applies.  
Chapter 2, paragraph 6 turn construction applies.  The feeder segment terminates at the IAF (see 
chapter 2, figures 2-4, 2-5, and 2-6 for construction). 
 
 
a. Length.  The minimum length of a sub-segment is determined under chapter 2, 
paragraph 6a(2) or 6b(1) as appropriate.  The maximum length of a sub-segment is 50 miles.  
The total length of the feeder segment should be as short as operationally possible. 
 
 
b. Width.  Primary area width is ± 3.0 NM from course centerline; secondary area width is 
1.0 NM (1-3-3-1).  These widths apply from the feeder segment initial fix to the approach 
IAF/termination fix. 
 
 
c. Obstacle Clearance.  The feeder segment OEA begins at the beginning fix early ATT 
and ends at the ending fix late ATT.  The minimum ROC over areas not designated as 
mountainous under Federal Aviation Regulation (FAR) 95 is 1,000 ft.  The minimum ROC 
within areas designated in FAR 95 as “mountainous” is 2,000 ft.  Order 8260.3, Volume 1, 
paragraphs 1720b(1), 1720b(2), and 1721 apply.  The published minimum feeder route altitude 
must provide at least the minimum ROC value and must not be less than the altitude established 
at the IAF.  (Refer to figures 2-2a, 2-2b and apply formula 2-12a for standard secondary ROC.)  
Apply formula 2-12b for designated mountainous area calculations (formulas are applicable for 
en route, feeder, and initial). 
 
 
 
Note:  ROC additive, see 8260.3, Volume 1, paragraph 1720. 
 
 
d. Descent Gradient, Helicopter (feeder, initial, intermediate segments).  The optimum 
descent gradient in feeder, initial, and intermediate segments is 400 ft/NM (6.58%, 3.77°); 
maximum is 600 ft/NM (9.87%, 5.64°).  Where higher descent gradients are required, Order 
8260.3, Volume 1, paragraph 1110 applies. 
 
 
e. Minimum Crossing Altitude (MCA).  Establish an MCA when an obstacle prevents a 
normal climb to a higher minimum en route altitude (MEA).  The normal climb gradient is 
shown in table 2-5.  When a MCA is required, chart the required climb gradient and rate of climb 
on the procedure.

The MCA computation is based on the distance from the nearest fix displacement 
tolerance line to the obstacle.  The computation is rounded to the next higher 100-ft increment 
(see figure 2-9 for an example MCA computation).

Chapter 2.  General Criteria 
 
Section 2.  Terminal Segments 
 
9. Initial Segment.  The initial segment begins at the IAF and ends at the intermediate fix (IF).  
The initial segment may contain sequences of straight sub segments (see figure 2-10).  Chapter 2, 
paragraphs 9b, 9c, 9d, and 9e apply to all sub segments individually.  The total length of all sub 
segments must not exceed 50 NM.  For descent gradient limits, see chapter 2, paragraph 8d.

a. Course Reversal.   The optimum design incorporates either the basic Y or T 
configuration (see AIM or FHP for further BASIC T/Y information).  This design eliminates the 
need for a specific course reversal pattern.  Where the optimum design cannot be used and a 
course reversal is required, establish a holding pattern at the initial, or intermediate approach fix.  
See chapter 2, paragraph 9f(2).  The maximum course change at the fix (IAF/IF) is to 90 degrees 
(70 degrees above FL 190). 
 
 
b. Alignment.  Design initial/initial and initial/intermediate TF segment intersections with 
the smallest amount of course change that is necessary for the procedure.  No course change is 
optimum.  Where a course change is necessary, it should normally be limited to 70 degrees or 
less; 30 degrees or less is preferred.  The maximum allowable course change between TF 
segments is 90 degrees. 
2-31 
03/10/2009

Note:  For USA, limit initial segment turn to a MAXIMUM of 60 degrees with a 
basic “Y” approach configuration for COPTER RNAV (GPS) procedures. 
 
 
c. Area – Length.  The maximum segment length (total of sub segments) is 50 NM.  
Minimum length of sub segments is determined as described in chapter 2, paragraphs 6a(2) and 
6b(1). 
 
 
d. Area – Width (see table 2-2). 
 
 
e. Obstacle Clearance.  The initial OEA begins at the segment beginning fix early ATT 
and ends at the segment ending fix late ATT. Apply 1,000 ft of ROC over the highest obstacle in 
the primary OEA.  The ROC in the secondary area is 500 ft at the primary boundary tapering 
uniformly to zero at the outer edge (see figure 2-11).

f. Holding Pattern Initial Segment.  A holding pattern may be incorporated into the initial 
segment procedure design where an operational benefit can be derived; e.g., arrival holding at an 
IAF, course reversal pattern at the IF, etc.  See FAA Order 7130.3, Holding Pattern Criteria, for 
RNAV holding pattern construction guidance. 
 
 
 
(1) Arrival Holding.  Ideally, the holding pattern inbound course should be aligned with 
the subsequent TF leg segment (tangent to course at the initial fix of the subsequent RF 
segment).  See figure 2-12a.  If the pattern is offset from the subsequent TF segment course, the 
subsequent segment length must accommodate the resulting DTA requirement.  Establish the 
minimum holding altitude at or above the IAF/IF (as appropriate) minimum altitude.  MEA 
minimum altitude may be lower than the minimum holding altitude. 
 
Figure 2-12a.  Arrival Holding Example. 
 
 
2-33 
03/10/2009 
 
8260.42B 
 
 
 
(2) Course Reversal.  Ideally, establish the minimum holding altitude as the minimum IF 
fix altitude (see figure 2-12b).  In any case, the published holding altitude must result in a 
suitable descent gradient in the intermediate segment:  optimum descent gradient in the initial 
and intermediate segment is 400 ft/NM (6.58%, 3.77°); maximum is 600 ft/NM (9.87%, 5.64°).  
If the pattern is offset from the subsequent TF segment course, the subsequent segment length 
must accommodate the resulting DTA requirement.  Maximum offset is 90 degrees. 
 
Figure 2-12b.  Course Reversal Example.

connect abeam the plotted position of the PFAF at the appropriate primary and secondary final 
segment beginning widths. 
 
 
a. Alignment (Maximum Course Change at the PFAF).  LNAV & LP.  Align the 
intermediate course within 30 degrees of the final approach course (30 degrees maximum course 
change). 
 
 
b. Length (Fix to Fix).  The minimum Helicopter category segment length is 2 NM.  
Where turns over 30 degrees at the IF are required, the minimum is 3 NM.  Where turns to and 
from the intermediate segment are necessary, determine minimum segment length using formula 
2-6 or formula 2-7, as appropriate.

prior to the PFAF to the outer boundary of the Y OCS abeam the PFAF (1 NM past the PFAF for

If a turn is designed at the IF, it is possible for the inside turn construction to

prior to the PFAF.  Where these cases occur, the inside (turn side) boundaries are a simple 
straight line connections as illustrated in figure 2-13b.

Maximum turn at the PFAF is 30 degrees.  When a PFAF turn is constructed, 
minimum FAS length is 3 NM for turns greater than 15 degrees.  Where the RNAV or LP 
intermediate course is not an extension of the FAC, use the following construction (see figure 
2-13c). 
 
 
(1) LNAV Offset Construction.  Where LNAV intermediate course is not an extension 
of the final course, use the following construction (see figure 2-13c, upper graphic). 
 
 
 
Step 1:  Construct line A perpendicular to the intermediate course 2 NM prior the PFAF. 
 
 
 
Step 2:  Construct line B perpendicular to the intermediate course extended 1 NM past 
the PFAF. 
 
 
 
Step 3:  Construct the inside turn boundaries by connecting the points of intersection of 
line A with the turn side intermediate segment boundaries with the intersection of line B with the 
turn side final segment boundaries. 
 
 
 
Step 4:  Construct arcs centered on the PFAF of 1 NM and 1.5 NM radius on the non-
turn side of the fix. 
 
 
 
Step 5:  Connect lines from the point of intersection of line A and the outside primary 
and secondary intermediate segment boundaries to tangent points on the arcs constructed in 
step 4. 
 
 
 
Step 6:  Connect lines tangent to the arcs created in step 4 that taper inward at 30 
degrees relative to the FAC to intersect the primary and secondary final segment boundaries as 
appropriate. 
 
The final segment evaluation extends to a point ATT prior to the angle bisector.  The inter-
mediate segment evaluation extends ATT past the angle bisector.  Therefore, the area within 
ATT of the angle bisector is evaluated for both the final and intermediate segments. 
 
 
(2) LP Offset Construction.  Where LP intermediate course is not an extension of the 
final course, use the following construction (see figure 2-13c, lower graphic). 
 
 
 
Step 1:  Construct line A perpendicular to the intermediate course 2 NM prior the PFAF. 
 
 
 
Step 2:  Construct line B perpendicular to the intermediate course extended 1 NM past 
the PFAF. 
 
 
 
Step 3:  Construct the inside turn boundaries by connecting the points of intersection of 
line A with the turn side intermediate segment boundaries with the intersection of line B with the 
turn side final segment boundaries. 
 
Step 4:  Connect lines from the point of intersection of line A and the outside primary 
and secondary intermediate segment boundaries to the final segment primary and secondary 
final segment lines at a point perpendicular to the final course at the PFAF.

Note:  DA must not occur at a greater distance from HRP than the turn-side point of 
intersection of the expanded outer boundary line with the final segment secondary 
boundary (intersection of line “B” with secondary boundary in figure 2-13c lower 
graphic).  If a higher DA is required, then the degree of offset must be less. 
 
The final segment evaluation extends to a point ATT prior to the angle bisector.  The 
intermediate segment evaluation extends ATT past the angle bisector.  Therefore, the area 
within ATT of the angle bisector is evaluated for both the final and intermediate segments.

The missed approach obstacle clearance standard is based on a minimum helicopter climb 
gradient of 400 ft/NM, protected by a ROC surface that rises at 304 ft/NM.  The MA ROC value 
is based on a requirement for a 96 ft/NM (400-304 = 96) increase in ROC value from the start-
of-climb (SOC) point located at JK.  The actual slope of the MA surface is (1 NM in feet)/304≈ 
19.987.  In manual application of TERPS, the rounded value of 20:1 has traditionally been 
applied.  However, this order is written for automated application; therefore, the full value (to 15 
significant digits) is used in calculations.  The nominal OCS slope (MAOCSslope) associated with 
any given missed approach climb gradient is calculated using formula 2-16.

Chapter 3.  Terminal Operations 
 
1. Approach Configuration.   The BASIC “Y” or “T” approach configuration should be the 
basis of procedure design.  Segment length is affected by altitude to be lost, fix tolerances, and 
turn magnitude at the fixes.   The optimum design incorporates a basic Y or T configuration.  
This design eliminates the need for a specific course reversal pattern.  Where the optimum 
design cannot be used and a course reversal is required, establish a holding pattern at the initial 
or intermediate approach fix.  Public procedures should not deviate from these shape and 
dimension configurations unless there is an operational advantage.  Construct IAFs within 
25 NM of the airport reference point/heliport reference point (ARP/HRP).  See chapter 2, 
paragraph 9 for construction methods. 
 
Note 1:  Allowance for precipitous terrain should be made as specified in Order 8260.3, 
Volume 1, paragraph 3.2.2b. 
 
Note 2:  For USA, limit initial segment turn to a MAXIMUM of 60 degrees with a basic “Y” 
approach configuration for COPTER RNAV (GPS) procedures.

MAXIMUM intercept angle for GPS and WAAS special procedures.  A turn exceeding 30 
degrees at the precise final approach fix (PFAF) requires documentation of equipment 
capability. 
 
 
a. Initial Approach Segment.  The initial approach segment begins at the IAF and ends at 
the IF.   The initial segment/subsegment obstacle evaluation area (OEA) begins at the early ATT 
of the segment beginning fix and ends at the late ATT of the segment/subsegment ending fix.  If 
a special procedure requires a course change at the IAF that exceeds 90 degrees, a waiver is 
required and is noted on FAA Form 8260-9 (no course change exceeding 120 degrees is 
allowed).  The IF may be identified as an along-track distance (ATD) from the PFAF.  Course 
change at the IF must not exceed 90 degrees for public and special procedures.  Construct the 
inbound leg of course reversal holding patterns within 30 degrees of the intermediate course 
(IF/IAF).  Apply chapter 2, paragraph 9 for course reversal using holding pattern criteria.  Do not 
establish a holding pattern in lieu of procedure turn at the PFAF.  See chapter 2 for construction 
methods. 
 
 
 
(1) Length.  The initial segment begins at IAF and ends at the IF.  The length should not 
exceed 10 NM unless operational requirements mandate a longer segment.  Determine the 
minimum length using the greater distance from formulas 2-7, 2-8, and table 3-1. 
3-1 
 
 
(2) Width. 
 
 
 
 
(a) Primary Area.  1.5 NM each side of the course centerline. 
 
 
 
 
(b) Secondary Area.  0.5 NM on each side of the primary area. 
 
 
 
(3) Obstacle Clearance.  Provide a minimum of 1,000 ft of required obstacle clearance 
(ROC) in the primary area.  In the secondary area, provide 500 ft of ROC at the inner edge, 
tapering uniformly to zero at the outer edge (see chapter 2, figure 2-12).  Calculate the secondary 
ROC using chapter 2, formula 2-12a or formula 2-12b.  Establish initial segment altitudes in 
100-ft increments that meet or exceed minimum ROC. 
 
 
 
(4) Descent Gradient for Initial Segments (see chapter 2,  paragraph 7). 
 
 
b. Intermediate Segment.  The intermediate segment begins at the IF and ends at the 
PFAF.  The intermediate segment OEA begins at the early ATT of the segment beginning fix 
and ends at the late ATT of the segment ending fix. The intermediate segment is used to prepare 
the helicopter speed and configuration for final approach segment entry; therefore, the gradient 
should be as flat as possible.  At a point beginning 2.0 NM from the PFAF, construct a taper to 
join the final approach segment (FAS). 
 
 
 
(1) Alignment.  The maximum course change at the PFAF is 30 degrees.  Course 
change more than 30 degrees requires Flight Standards approval. 
 
 
 
(2) Area. 
 
 
 
 
(a) Length.  The intermediate segment begins at the IF and ends at the PFAF.  The 
length should not exceed 5.0 NM (optimum length is 3.0 NM).  Determine the minimum length 
using the greater distance from formulas 2-7, 2-8, and table 3-1. 
 
 
 
 
(b) Width. 
 
 
 
 
 
1 Primary Area.  1.5 NM each side of the segment centerline, beginning at the 
earliest IF position.  The segment taper begins 2.0 NM prior to the plotted position of the PFAF 
to reach a ± 0.55 NM  width at the PFAF plotted position (see chapter 2, figures 2-13a, 2-13b, 
and 2-13c). 
 
 
 
 
 
2 Secondary Area.  0.50 NM on each side of the primary area. 
 
 
 
 
Note:  USAF/USA/USCG/USN operating at 90 KIAS:  Change 0.55 NM to 
0.70 NM. 
 
 
 
(3) Obstacle Clearance.  Provide a MINIMUM of 500 ft of ROC in the primary area.  In 
the secondary area, provide 500 ft of ROC at the inner edge tapering to zero feet at the outer 
edge.  Establish altitudes for each intermediate segment in 100-ft increments, and round to the 
3-2 
next higher 100-ft increment.  Calculate the secondary ROC using chapter 2, formula 2-13 (see 
chapter 2, figure 2-14).

Chapter 4.  IFR Final and Visual Segments 
 
1. General.  The approach procedure type is determined by the visual segment.  The instrument 
flight rule (IFR) final approach segment (FAS) applies to all five types of procedures.  Use the 
criteria in chapter 3 for the construction of the initial and intermediate segments up to the precise 
final approach fix (PFAF), and chapter 5 criteria for the missed approach segment construction.  
Apply chapter 4, paragraph 3 criteria to LNAV IFR final segments, and chapter 4, paragraph 9 to 
WAAS LP IFR final segments. 
 
 
Note:  Chapter 4 graphics are not drawn to scale 
 
 
a. Final Segment Stepdown Fix (SDF).  An SDF may be applied where the MDA can be 
lowered 60 ft, or a visibility reduction can be achieved.  Order 8260.3, Volume 1, paragraph 289 
applies, with the following exceptions: 
 
 
 
(1) Establish step-down fix locations in 0.10 NM increments. 
 
 
 
(2) The minimum distance between stepdown fixes is 1 NM. 
 
 
 
(3) Establish stepdown fix altitudes using 20-ft increments, rounded to the next higher 
20-ft increment.  For example, 2104 becomes 2120. 
 
 
 
(4) Where a Remote Altimeter Setting Source (RASS) adjustment is in use, the 
published stepdown fix altitude must be established no lower than the altitude required for the 
greatest amount of adjustment (i.e., the published minimum altitude must incorporate the greatest 
amount of RASS adjustment required). 
 
 
 
(5) Descent gradient:  Chapter 4, paragraphs 3a(3), 3a(4), and 3a(5) apply. 
 
 
 
(6) Obstacles eliminated from consideration (3.5:1 area) under this paragraph must be 
noted in the procedure documentation (see Order 8260.19). 
 
 
 
(7) Use formula 4-4 in chapter 4, paragraph 3a(6) concerning Order 8260.3, Volume 1, 
paragraph 289 to determine the OIS elevation at an obstacle and minimum fix altitude based on 
an obstacle height. 
 
 
 
(8) To mitigate surface penetrations: 
 
• Remove obstruction, or 
• Reduce obstruction height, or 
• Adjust the MDA, or 
• Combination of options. 
 
2. Missed Approach.  Construct the missed approach for all procedures using chapter 5 
criteria. 
 
4-1 
03/10/2009 
 
8260.42B 
3. The five procedure types are: 
 
• IFR to an IFR Heliport 
• IFR to a VFR Heliport (IVH) (Proceed Visually) 
• IFR to a VFR Runway (IVR) (Proceed Visually) 
• Point-in-Space (PinS) Approach (Proceed VFR) 
• IFR to an IFR Runway 
 
 
a. LNAV IFR Final Approach Segment (FAS).  The IFR FAS begins at the PFAF and 
ends at the missed approach point (MAP) (see figure 4-1).  This FAS construction is unique to 
helicopters.  It applies trapezoidal rather than the linear construction used for fixed-wing 
applications.  Locate LNAV PFAF using chapter 2, formula 2-15.  MAP location should provide 
the best compromise of lowest visibility and visual segment descent angle (VSDA).  The 
optimum distance for the “Proceed Visually” MAP is 0.65 nautical mile (NM) [3/4 statute mile 
(SM) visibility] from the heliport.  For public procedures, the preferred approach paths should be 
aligned with the prevailing wind direction to avoid downwind and minimize crosswind 
operations.  Other approach/departure paths should be based on the assessment of the prevailing 
winds or when this information is not available, the separation between such flight paths and the 
preferred flight path should be at least 135 degrees. 
 
 
 
(1) Alignment.  The IFR final segment connects the PFAF to the MAP.  The course 
change at the PFAF from the intermediate course to the final approach course (FAC) must not 
exceed 30 degrees.  The MAP is located on the FAC between the PFAF and a point no closer to 
the helipoint than 0.3 NM from the visual segment reference line (VSRL).  For a straight-in 
approach, the course change at the MAP must not exceed 30 degrees to an IFR heliport helipoint 
or 30 degrees from a runway centerline (RCL) extended to an IFR runway threshold (RWT).  
Optimum alignment is coincident with the RCL.  When the alignment exceeds 5 degrees the 
optimum alignment point is 1,500 ft from the RWT on RCL.  Where circling approaches are 
required, apply Order 8260.3 Category A criteria. 
 
 
 
(2) Area.  The obstacle evaluation area (OEA) begins at the earliest PFAF along-track 
tolerance (ATT ) and ends at the latest MAP ATT (see figure 4-1). 
 
 
 
 
(a) Length.  The IFR final approach segment begins at the PFAF and ends at the 
MAP.   The length should not exceed 10 NM (optimum length is 3 NM).  Determine the  
minimum length using the greater of descent distance, formula 2-7 or 2-8, and table 3-1. 
 
 
 
 
(b) Width. 
 
 
 
 
 
1 Primary Area.  The primary area boundary begins 0.55 NM* each side of the 
final segment centerline at the earliest PFAF ATT.  The width remains constant until the latest 
PFAF ATT.  It then tapers to 0.40 NM* at the latest MAP ATT. 
 
Note:  USAF/USA/USCG/USN operating at 90 KIAS:  Change 
0.55 NM to 0.70 NM and 0.40  NM to 0.50 NM (primary area). 
 
4-2 
03/10/2009 
 
8260.42B 
 
 
 
 
2 Secondary Area.  The secondary area boundary is constant, 0.50 NM each 
side of the primary area.  Calculate the primary half-width at any distance from latest MAP ATT 
using formula 4-1a. 
 
 
 
(c) Required Obstacle Clearance.  Primary area required obstacle clearance (ROC) is 
250 ft.  Secondary ROC is 250 ft at the edge of the primary area, tapering uniformly to zero at 
the outer edge.  Calculate secondary ROC using formula 4-1b.

800 ft/NM (7.5 degrees). 
 
Note 2:  The visual segment descent gradient is considered separately in 
approaches to VFR heliports or VFR runways. 
 
 
 
(4) Descent Gradient/Angle to an IFR Runway or an IFR Heliport.  Apply the same 
descent gradient/angle in chapter 4, paragraph 3a(3) for an IFR approach to an IFR runway, but 
the distance/elevation calculations begin at the PFAF and end at RWT/TCH elevation (see 
figure 4-2b).  For an IFR approach to an IFR Heliport, the distance/elevation calculations begin 
at the PFAF and end at HCH (see figure 4-2c).  Apply formula 4-3 for descent angle, and

(5) Stepdown Descent Gradient/Angle.  When a stepdown fix is used, measure the 
descent gradient/angle from the PFAF at the PFAF altitude to the stepdown fix at the minimum 
fix altitude, then to the MAP at the MDA.  For a stabilized approach, provide a constant 
gradient/angle from the PFAF to the MAP, (may require raising the PFAF altitude).  A stepdown 
fix must be located no closer than 0.6 NM to the PFAF or MAP. 
 
 
 
(6) Existing Obstacles Close to the PFAF or Stepdown Fix.  If the segment descent 
gradient/angle is less than 800 ft/NM (7.5 degrees), Order 8260.3B, Volume 1, paragraph 289

Heliport (see profile figures 4-3 and 4-4). 
 
 
 
(2) Width.  The visual segment splay begins at the Visual Segment Reference Line 
(VSRL).  It splays from the VSRL endpoints relative to the FAC to the latest FAS primary area 
width at the latest MAP ATT (see plan view figure 4-6 (right)).  Where the OCS surface extends 
to a point 250 ft below the MDA, the boundary follows the primary area to its end point (see plan 
view figures 4-4 and 4-6 (left)). 
 
 
c. Obstacle Clearance Surface.  The OCS begins at the VSRL and extends 1.0 degree 
below the VSDA (see figures 4-3 and 4-4).

d. IFR Heliport with Visual Segment Descent Point (VSDP).  A VSDP may be 
established for straight-in helicopter GPS procedures.  Apply the VDP concepts in Order 8260.3, 
Volume 1, paragraph 253, except use helipoint elevation vice RWT elevation and HCH vice 
TCH.  The recommended descent angle from the VSDP is 6.0 degrees.  The maximum angle is 
7.5 degrees.  Locate the VSDP on the FAC at the point where the visual glide slope indicator 
(VGSI) on-glide slope beam intersects the MDA.  Publish the VSDP as an ATD from the MAP.  
Do not publish a VSDP where the VSDP falls between the MAP and the helipoint.  Where a 
VGSI is not established, calculate the VSDP to helipoint distance along the FAC using formula 
4-5: 
Note:  Where no VSDP has been established, refer to chapter 4, paragraph 4e, then 
proceed from chapter 4, paragraph 4d(1).

8260.42B 
maximum descent gradient/angle is 478 ft/NM (4.5 degrees) without a waiver).  Where a VGSI 
facility is installed, the VSDP OCS inclines upward from the VSRL at an angle 1.0 degree below 
the aiming angle of the on-glide-slope beam.  Where no VGSI facility is installed, the VSDP 
OCS rises 1 degree below the VSDA.  Publish the VSDP as an ATD from the MAP.  The 
minimum HCH is 5 ft.  The maximum HCH is 20 ft unless approved by Flight Standards.  
Calculate the VSDP distance (D) from the helipoint using formula 4-10.

5. Special IFR Approach to a VFR Heliport (IVH) (Proceed Visually).  The special 
procedure provides a measure of obstruction protection/ identification along the visual track from 
a MAP to a specific VFR heliport.  The visual segment is based on the premise that the pilot will 
maintain level flight at the MDA until the helicopter is in a position to initiate a descent to the 
helipoint.  Where obstacles preclude an immediate descent at the MAP to the FATO, establish an 
ATD fix to provide a descent point to the FATO.  When an amended procedure no longer meets 
the criteria in this paragraph, a PinS procedure applying the criteria in chapter 4, paragraph 7 
may be published.  Compute the distance for the Remote Altimeter Setting Source (RASS) 
adjustment for the MDA and stepdown altitudes for the IVH approach procedures from the 
source to the MAP. 
 
 
a. Alignment.  The IVH visual segment connects the MAP to the helipoint.  The optimum 
IVH visual segment is aligned with the FAC.  The course change at the MAP must not exceed 30 
degrees. 
 
 
b. Area. 
 
 
 
(1) Length.  The IVH visual segment OEA begins at the earliest MAP ATT and ends at 
the VSRL.  The IVH visual segment OEA maximum length is 10,560 ft (2 SM), measured from 
the MAP plotted position to the helipoint.  The optimum MAP/ATD fix to helipoint distance is 
4-15 
03/10/2009 
 
8260.42B 
3,949 ft (0.65 NM).  The minimum distance from the MAP/ATD fix to the helipoint is 3,342 ft 
(0.55 NM). 
 
 
 
(2) Width.  The IVH visual segment splay begins at the VSRL.  It splays from the VSRL 
endpoints toward the MAP until the visual segment OEA reaches the appropriate construction 
width [see chapter 4, paragraph 5b(2)(a) or 5b(2)(b)]. 
 
 
 
 
(a) Straight Course Construction.  Connect the final primary area outer edges (cd) to 
the VSRL outer edges (ef) (see figure 4-8 ).

(b) Turn at the MAP Construction.  Refer to figure 4-9, and connect the tangent on 
the turn side (b) of the MAP nearest the heliport to the VSRL at point (e).  This connection 
extends the turn-side area and identifies whether final secondary areas lie within the visual OEA 
(The MDA must provide primary ROC within this area).  Connect the non-turn-side primary area

(3) Visual Segment OIS Evaluation.  Apply chapter 4, paragraph 3a for the IFR segment 
OCA and ROC.  Apply chapter 4, paragraph 3a(3) in constructing the descent gradient/angle in 
the IFR segment. 
 
 
c. Visual Segment Descent Angle (VSDA).  The VSDA is a developer-specified angle 
extending from a point 5 to 20 ft directly above the helipoint to the MDA.  The VSDA must 
cross the MDA between the helipoint and the MAP.  The maximum VSDA is 7.5 degrees, 
optimum is 6.0 degrees, VSDA angles higher than 7.5 degrees require Flight Standards Service 
approval. (see figure 4-10).

d. Visual Segment OIS.  The OIS begins at the VSRL and extends upward toward the 
MAP at an angle of (VSDA – 1 degree).  The OIS rises to the point it reaches an altitude equal to 
the MDA minus the ROC and adjustments.  Where the MAP is beyond this point, the OIS 
becomes a level surface to the MAP plotted position.  Measure obstacles using the shortest 
distance to the VSRL.  Obstacles should not penetrate the OIS; if they penetrate in the initial 
evaluation, take one of the following actions, listed in preferential order (see figure 4-11): 
 
 
 
(1) Remove or adjust obstacle location and/or height to eliminate the penetration, or 
 
4-17

8260.42B 
 
 
(2) Raise the VSDA to achieve an OIS angle that clears the obstacle, (7.5 degrees 
maximum without Flight Standards Service approval), or 
 
 
 
(3) Identify the obstacle with the greatest penetration.  Raise the MDA the penetration 
amount and round to the next higher 20-ft increment.  Initiate action to have the obstacle marked 
and lighted, if feasible.  Depict all obstacles on the approach chart that penetrate the OIS and 
include in required training. 
 
 
 
(4) Raise the HCH to ≤ 20 ft provided the height is consistent with the helicopter’s 
ability to hover out of ground effect.  When this procedure is applied, raise the OIS origin above 
the helipoint elevation by the amount that the HCH is increased (see figure 4-11).

6. Special IFR Approach to A VFR Runway (IVR) (Proceed Visually).  This special 
procedure provides protection/identification along a visual track from the MAP to a specific 
point on a VFR runway (see figure 4-12 example).  This procedure requires the training and 
equipment contained/specified in an OpSpec or letter of authorization (LOA).  This procedure 
must meet all IVH (Proceed Visually) procedure requirements and the following additional 
requirements: 
 
 
a. Location on the runway.  The helipoint (aiming point) may be located at any point on a 
runway centerline, but should be at least a distance of (1.5 * Rotor Diameter) from the end of the 
usable runway on centerline.  The runway is not required to be marked with heliport markings.  
The visual track from the MAP to the final approach area helipoint must be charted. 
 
 
b. Alignment.  The optimum FAC and visual flight path is aligned with the extended 
runway centerline, with the MAP at the threshold.  The FAC must be aligned within 30 degrees 
of the extended runway centerline. See paragraph 5 and figures 4-8, 4-9 and 4-12 for OEA 
construction examples. 
 
 
c. Day operations.  An ‘acceptable’ visual segment day flight evaluation for flyability and 
OIS obstacle penetration must be completed. 
 
4-18 
03/10/2009 
 
8260.42B 
 
d. Night operations.  An ‘acceptable’ visual segment night flight evaluation for flyability 
must be completed.  This evaluation must confirm the runway lighting system is visible from the 
MAP. 
 
 
e. Helipoint Location.  The runway final approach area about the heliport must be clearly 
viewable from the MAP.

7. PinS Approach (Proceed VFR).  The VFR segment on a PinS (Proceed VFR) approach 
procedure provides a measure of obstacle protection/identification to allow a safe transition from 
IFR to VFR flight.  The area is not intended to support IFR descent. 
 
Apply Order 8260.3, Volume 1, chapter 11 pertaining to PinS approach criteria, except no 
requirement exists for a MAP to be located beyond 2,600 ft of the helipoint.  A PinS (Proceed 
VFR) procedure may be developed to a heliport, multiple heliports, or a geographical area not 
associated with a specific heliport.  Refer to chapter 2, paragraph 3 to determine whether 
procedures are ‘Specials.’  Compute the distance for the Remote Altimeter Setting Source 
(RASS) adjustment for the MDA and stepdown altitudes for the PinS approach procedures from 
the source to the MAP. 
 
 
a. Alignment.  The PinS visual segment is a 5,280 ft-radius arc segment centered at the 
FAC and the latest MAP ATT intersection. 
 
 
b. Area.  The PinS OEA is a 5,280 ft-radius arc segment centered at the FAC and the latest 
MAP  ATT intersection.  The arc segment is laterally bounded by 20 degree splay lines (relative 
the FAC-extended), originating at the FAS secondary boundaries and the latest MAP ATT (see 
figure 4-13). 
 
 
c. Length.  A 5,280 ft radius as described above. 
4-19 
03/10/2009 
 
8260.42B 
 
d. PinS visual segment OIS (see chapter 4, paragraph 7e). This surface must not be 
penetrated except when a ‘special approach procedure’ MDA, not providing obstacle clearance 
in this area, is mandatory for mission completion.  Obstacles that penetrate the special 
procedure surface must be charted and included in the required training (AAOs are not charted).

e. Obstacle Clearance in the PinS VFR Segment.  Add 250 ft of ROC (minus 
adjustments) to the highest obstacle/terrain within the VFR area and (round to the next higher 
20-ft increment).  The final MDA is the higher of the MDAs calculated for the final and VFR 
segments.  This does not apply to special approaches (see chapter 4, paragraph 7d). 
 
 
f. Visibility.  The minimum final segment visibility is ¾ SM for a height above surface 
(HAS) of 800 ft and below.  Where a HAS exceeds 800 ft, the MINIMUM visibility is 1.0 SM. 
 
8. IFR to an IFR Runway. 
 
 
a. Configuration and Alignment.  The MAP location should provide the best compromise 
of lowest visibility and VSDA.  Except where the alignment is to the RWT, the mandatory MAP 
location is at the FAC and RCL intersection.  Where the alignment is to the RCL, the optimum 
MAP location is at the RWT, with optional MAP location along the FAC between the PFAF and 
the RWT. 
 
 
b. Area.  The final OEA begins at the earliest PFAF ATT and ends at the latest MAP ATT, 
RWT, or a point abeam the RWT, whichever is farthest.  Apply chapter 4, paragraph 3a criteria 
for the IFR segment OEA and ROC (see figure 4-1). 
4-20 
03/10/2009 
 
8260.42B 
 
c. Descent Gradient/Angle.  Calculate the FAS descent angle from the PFAF altitude at the 
plotted position of the PFAF to the TCH at RWT.  Apply chapter 4, paragraph 3a(4). 
 
 
d. Visual Segment.  Apply Order 8260.3, Volume 1, paragraph 3.3.2.d.  Establish a 
40 ± 5 ft TCH for runways where no VGSI is installed.  Where a VGSI is installed, a final 
descent gradient and VSDA may be established to coincide with the established gradients/angles 
for angles of 3.0 angles or more.  If the descent gradient/angle cannot be published coincident 
(within ± 0.20 degrees) and TCH values within 3 ft of the published VGSI glide slope angle, 
publish a note on the chart. 
 
 
e. Visibility.  See chapter 7, paragraph 1b.  Apply Order 8260.3, Volume 1, paragraph 
1127.  Where obstacles penetrate Order 8260.3, Volume 1 paragraph 3.3.2.d. surfaces, add the 
chart note:  Visibility Reduction by helicopters NA.  See Order 8260.19, paragraph 854(i)(3). 
 
Note:  When a special procedure has a GPA greater than 5.7 degrees and a TCH higher 
than 45 ft, Order 8260.3, Volume 1, paragraph 1127 may be applied.  Table 25 
application is required. 
 
9. WAAS LP Criteria.  The WAAS LP criteria apply to the final approach only.  For all other 
segments apply GPS criteria except where noted for a turn at the PFAF, and missed approach 
constructions that are different.  This implementation of WAAS does not include a glidepath 
function for these procedures.  Criteria in this chapter provide a narrower OEA in the IFR FAS 
and OIS in the visual segment.  The segment lengths and descent rate/gradients are the same as 
chapter 4, paragraph 3.  The intermediate segment begins with the same width at the GPS 
intermediate fix (IF), reference chapter 3, paragraph 1b, tailored to the beginning WAAS FAS 
width, reference chapter 4, paragraph 9d at the PFAF.  Apply chapter 4, paragraph 5 through 7 to 
design approaches in the visual/visual flight rule (VFR) segments, and apply chapter 4, 
paragraphs 8 and 9 for the IFR FAS OEA and ROC.  Apply an OIS, reference chapter 4, 
paragraph 5d, with the reduced width, reference chapter 4, paragraph 8d.  Apply chapter 4, 
paragraph 5 for the analysis of the VFR area of a Point in Space (PinS) (Proceed VFR) approach. 
 
Figure 4-17 depicts the basic configuration for determining the Flight Path Alignment Point 
(FPAP) and fictitious helipoint (FHP) coordinates.  Locate the FHP 2,600 ft from the MAP.  The 
FPAP is a point defined by the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS-84) latitude, longitude, and 
is located 9,023 ft from the FHP. 
 
 
a. Minimums.  Apply chapter 7. 
 
 
b. Use The Following Steps for WAAS LP Procedure Construction: 
 
 
 
Step 1:  Determine the FAS course alignment, MAP, FHP, and FPAP coordinates. 
 
 
 
Step 2:  Calculate the distance (ft) from the FHP to the PFAF (DPFAF) using formula 
4-11.  Calculate the primary and secondary area widths at any distance from FHP  to the earliest 
point the PFAF can be received using formulas 4-11 and 4-13 (see figure 4-14).

Step 3:  After constructing the IFR final trapezoid area, analyze the FAS by determining 
the controlling obstacle within the IFR final segment by applying the ROC in chapter 4, 
paragraph 9b and determining the minimum descent altitude (MDA). 
 
 
 
Step 4:  When constructing an IFR to a VFR heliport procedure (IVH, Proceed Visually), 
or an IFR approach to a VFR runway procedure (IVR, proceed visualy), apply chapter 4 criteria 
for the visual segment, but construct the narrower OIS in accordance with chapter 4, paragraph 
9g. 
 
 
 
Step 5:  When constructing a PinS (Proceed VFR) approach, apply chapter 4 criteria for 
the VFR segment and adjust the MDA of the IFR segment after an analysis of the VFR segment 
if required. 
 
 
 
Step 6:  Construct the missed approach using chapter 5. 
 
 
c. Determine FAS Course Alignment, FPAP and FHP Coordinates.  The FAS course 
determines the positional relationship between the FPAP and the FHP.  Calculate the FPAP 
latitude and longitude coordinates using the MAP as a starting point after determining the 
procedure final approach course (FAC).  Use the direct program and extend the FAS course as an 
azimuth at a distance of 2,600 ft from the MAP to determine the FHP coordinates.  Extend this 
course 9,023 ft beyond the FHP to calculate the FPAP coordinates  (see figure 4-14 and table 
4-1).

d. Area.  The FAS OEA begins at the earliest PFAF position and ends at the MAP latest 
ATT (see figure 4-16).  The PFAF and MAP ATT is ±40 m.  Apply 250 ft of ROC in the 
primary area.  The secondary area ROC is 250 ft at the primary boundary tapering uniformly to 
zero at the outer edge.  The beginning primary area width nearest the FHP is 867.79 ft, and the 
secondary areas are 468.60 ft (see figures 4-15b and 4-16).  Calculate the primary and secondary 
widths at any point between FHP and PFAF using formulas 4-12 (primary) and 4-13 
(secondary). 
 
 
 
(1) Length.  The standard IFR final segment length PFAF to MAP is 3 NM but is also 
determined by descent gradient.  The minimum length is 2 NM and the maximum length is 
50,000 ft. (see figure 4-15a).

Chapter 5.  Missed Approach 
 
1. General. 
 
 
a. Missed Approach (MA) Construction. 
 
 
 
(1) Speed.  Apply 70 KIAS for civil procedures (see chapter 2, paragraph 1) and 90 
KIAS for military.  Apply wind values (see chapter 2, formula 2-3b) and bank angles (see 
chapter 2, table 2-4). 
 
 
 
(2) Optimum Flight Path.  The missed approach segment ends at a holding point 
designated by a missed approach holding fix (MAHF).  Optimum routing is straight ahead to a 
direct entry into holding at the MAHF.  If the MA routing terminates at a “T” IAF, optimum 
MA holding pattern alignment is with the initial inbound course, with either a teardrop or direct 
entry into holding (see figure 5-1a). 
 
Note:  USA:  Develop and annotate an alternate RNAV(GPS) MA procedure when 
requested. 
 
 
b. Obstacle Clearance Standard.  Calculate the nominal OCS slope (MAOCSSLOPE) 
associated with a given missed approach climb gradient using chapter 2, formula 2-15.  See 
chapter 2, paragraph 17 for Missed Approach Conventions. 
 
 
c. Missed Approach Section 1 (MAS-1).  Section 1 begins at earliest MAP along-track 
tolerance (ATT) and extends to the start-of-climb (SOC), or the point where the aircraft is 
projected to cross 400 ft above airport/heliport elevation, whichever is the greatest distance from 
MAP.  See figure 5-1b for MA segment point and line designations.  Figure 5-2 depicts the 
Section 1/Section 2 (partial), OCS plan and profile view beginning at an altitude of MDA minus 
100 ft plus adjustments (see chapter 4 for greater final segment detail). 
 
 
 
(1) Length. 
 
 
 
 
(a) Flat Surface Length (FSL). 
 
 
 
 
 
1 LNAV.  Section 1 flat surface begins at CD (0.3 NM prior to the MAP) and 
extends (distance FSL feet) to JK. 
 
 
 
 
 
2 LP.  Section 1 flat surface begins at CD  [40 meters prior to the MAP] and 
extends (distance FSL feet) to JK. 
 
 
 
 
Step 1:  Calculate the FSL value using formula 5-1.  Use chapter 4, final segment 
formulas 4-1a, (LNAV primary and total), and 4-12 (LP primary), and 4-13 (LP Secondary 
distance) to determine MAS starting widths.

d. These criteria cover two basic MA constructions: 
 
• 
Straight missed approach 
• 
Turning missed approach 
 
 
Note:  These construction methods accommodate traditional combination straight and 
turning missed approaches. 
 
 
 
(1) The section 2 obstacle evaluation area (OEA) splays 15 degrees relative to the 
nominal track to reach full width (see figure 5-3).  The OEA ends at the MA Holding Fix 
(MAHF) latest ATT.  Apply the Section 2 standard MA OCS slope beginning from AB .  
Calculate MA OCS slope values using chapter 2, formula 2-15. 
 
 
Note:   All references to ‘standard  MA OCS slope’ and/or use of ‘20:1’ refer to chapter 2, 
formula 2-15 output, with an input climb gradient (CG) of 400 ft/NM. 
 
 
 
(2) Where a higher than standard CG (400 ft/NM) is required, apply the CG and the CG-
related OCS from the SOC.  Apply secondary areas as specified in this chapter.  Measure the 4:1 
secondary OCS perpendicular to the nominal track,  measured from the primary boundary,  or 
perpendicular to the primary boundary when considering arcs, diagonal corner-cutters, etc. 
 
 
 
(3) Locate the MAHF within 25 NM of the ARP/HRP.  Determine minimum leg length 
for course changes following the first fix after the MAP using the greater distance from chapter 
2, formulas 2-7, 2-8, and 2-9, climb distance required, and chapter 3, table 3-1. 
 
 
 
(4) Design MA holding for 90 KIAS, or the appropriate restricted speed. 
 
2. Straight Missed Approach.  The straight missed approach course (MAC) is a continuation 
of the final approach course (FAC).  The straight MA section 2 OEA begins at secton 1 end (AB) 
and splays at 15 degrees relative to the nominal track until reaching full primary and secondary 
width (0.5-1.5-1.5-0.5).  Apply the section 2 standard OCS, or the OCS associated with a higher 
CG,  beginning at AB from the section 1 end OCS elevation. (When the increased CG is no 
longer required, revert to the section 2 standard OCS).  Determine primary OCS elevation at an 
5-4 
03/10/2009 
 
8260.42B 
obstacle by measuring the along-track distance from AB to a point at/abeam the obstacle.  Where 
the obstacle is located in the secondary area, apply the primary OCS slope to a point abeam the 
obstacle, then apply the 4:1 secondary slope (perpendicular to the track) from the primary 
boundary to the obstacle (see chapter 5, figures 5-3, 5-4). 
 
3. Turning Missed Approach.  Apply turning criteria when requiring a turn at or beyond SOC.  
Where secondary areas exist in section 1, they continue to full width in section 2.  Terminate 
turn-at-fix turn-side secondary areas not later than the early turn point. Do not apply turn-side 
secondary areas for turn-at-altitude construction.  The terms ‘inside turn’ and ‘outside turn’ are 
used to reduce verbiage in describing turn associated construction and relationships.  Where 
required, alternate construction steps (indicated by Step #ALT) are provided to supplement or 
replace the primary step.  
 
There are two types of turn construction for the first MA turn: 
 
• Turn at an altitude (see chapter 5, paragraph 3a): 
o 
Always followed by a DF leg ending with a DF/TF connection  
 
• Turn at a fix (see chapter 5, paragraph 3b): 
o 
Always followed by a TF leg ending with a TF/TF connection. 
o 
May be followed by an RF leg (which requires advanced avionics) when the initial 
straight leg has reached full width, ending with an RF/TF or RF/RF connection.  RF 
turn initial fix must be located where the aircraft is at least 500 ft above airport 
elevation. 
 
Following a turn, the minimum segment length must be the greater of: 
 
• The minimum length calculated using chapter 2, formulas 2-7, 2-8 and 2-9. 
 
• The distance from previous fix to the intersection of the 30-degree converging outer 
boundary line extension and the nominal track, (plus segment end fix DTA). 
 
Minimum DF leg length must accommodate 6 seconds (minimum) of flight time based on either 
70 KIAS or 90 KIAS, as appropriate, applied between the wind spiral (WS)/direct-to-fix-line 
tangent point, and the earliest maneuvering point of the DF/TF fix.  Convert to TAS using 
chapter 2, formula 2-3a and the MAHF altitude. 
 
 
a. Turn At An Altitude.  Apply turn-at-an-altitude construction unless the first MA turn is 
at a fix.  Since pilots may commence the MA at altitudes higher than the MDA and helicopter 
climb rates differ, turn-at-an-altitude construction protects the large area where turn initiation is 
expected.  This construction also provides protection for ‘turn as soon as practicable’ and 
combination straight and turning operations.  When a required turning altitude exceeds the 
minimum turning altitude (typically 400 ft above the airport, heliport, or height above surface), 
specify the turning altitude in a 100-ft increment.  Where operationally required, 20-ft 
increments may be applied. 
 
5-5 
03/10/2009 
 
8260.42B 
Note:  ‘Turn as soon as practicable’ includes, but is not limited to operational 
suitability, flight characteristics/capability, appropriate altitude, positioned at or beyond 
the MA early ATT, as well as the feasibility, workability, and viability of the intended 
maneuver. 
 
When a turn at altitude MA, (low MDA, turn at less than 400 ft above airport/heliport or height 
above surface, etc.) is required,  Flight Standards Approval is required. 
 
Track guidance is assumed throughout the operation; therefore, dead reckoning (DR) segments 
are not considered.  Apply turning MA criteria whenever the MAC differs from the FAC.  The 
following applies: 
 
• Section 1/Section 2 connection is depicted in chapter 5, figure 5-5 for a minimum altitude 
turn-at-altitude MA.  The CD is the earliest the MAP can be received.  AB is the SOC 
(chapter 5, figure 5-6 depicts higher than minimum altitude turns). 
 
• Section 2 and section 1 connect at AB. 
 
• Construct section 2 outside-turn boundaries using WS vice specified radii.  Construct 
outside boundaries in relation to these WS and late turn track (see chapter 5, figures 5-9, 
5-13, 5-15). 
 
• Construct inside-turn boundaries in relation to the early turn track (see chapter 5, figures   
5-5, 5-6). 
 
• Apply the standard OCS slope (or the assigned CG-associated slope) beginning at AB at 
AB OCS height.  The secondary 4:1 surface rises from the primary OCS. 
 
 
 
(1) Turn Initiation Area (TIA).  Construct the TIA, a portion of a straight MA, 
beginning from the earliest MA turn point (CD), and ending where the specified minimum 
turning altitude is reached, (AB or LL’ ).  Base the TIA length on the climb distance required to 
reach the turning altitude.  The TIA minimum length must place the aircraft at an altitude from 
which obstacle clearance is provided in section 2 outside the TIA.  The TIA boundary varies 
with length, the shortest B-A-C-D, where AB overlies JK.  Where the TIA is contained within 
section 1, B-A-J-C-D-K defines the boundary.  Where the required turn altitude exceeds that 
supported by section 1, the TIA  extends into section 2, (see figure 5-8 and Order 8260.54 for 
construction examples) and points L’-L-A-J-C-D-K-B define its boundary.  In this case, L-L’ is 
the early turn point based on the helicopter climbing at the prescribed CG.  Calculate TIA length 
using chapter 5, formula 5-2a.  A 4:1 secondary is depicted on the non-turning side of the 
primary (see chapter 5, figures 5-6, 5-8, and 5-9). 
 
 
 
Step 1:  Turn altitude.  The turn altitude is either operationally specified (must be at or 
above altitude required by obstacles) or determined by obstacle evaluation.  Evaluate the nominal 
OCS.  If the OCS is penetrated, mitigate the penetration with one or a combination of the 
following: 
 
5-6 
03/10/2009 
 
8260.42B 
• Raise MDA 
• Establish a climb gradient that clears the obstacle 
• Move MAP 
• If the penetration is outside the TIA, consider raising the climb-to altitude 
 
 
 
(a) Determine the helicopter required minimum turning altitude: 
 
• Identify the controlling obstacle in section 2 (straight MA) 
o For straight OCS/CG/length options 
• Identify the controlling obstacle in section 2, (typically turn-side) 
• Find the shortest distance from the TIA lateral boundary to the obstacle 
• Apply this distance and the MA OCS slope to find the TIA-to-obstacle OCS 
rise 
• The minimum TIA boundary, (and OCS end elevation) equals the obstacle 
elevation minus OCS rise 
• The minimum turn altitude is the sum of (TIA OCS boundary elevation) and 
(final ROC), rounded to the next higher 100 ft-increment (where 
operationally required, 20-ft increments may be applied) 
 
Note 1:  TIA lateral boundary is the straight segment (portion) lateral boundary 
until the required minimum turn altitude and TIA length are established. 
 
Note 2:  Repeat Step 1 until acceptable results are obtained. 
 
 
 
 
 
The specified altitude must equal or exceed the section 1 end altitude.  Find 
section 1 end altitude using chapter 5, formula 5-1c.

Step 3:  Locate the TIA end at a distance TIA length beyond CD (from Step 2) 
(LL’) where the applied OCS reaches the required TIA end surface elevation (from Step 1). 
 
 
 
 
 
Step 4:  Locate the latest turn point, (PP’) at distance rr (from chapter 2, 
formula 2-4a) beyond the TIA end (AB/LL’).  See example chapter 5, figures 5-6 and 5-8. 
 
 
(2) OEA Construction after TIA.  The OEA includes areas to protect the earliest and 
latest direct tracks from the TIA to the fix.  Construct the obstacle areas about each of the tracks 
as described below.  See chapter 5, figures 5-9 through 5-15 for various turn geometry 
construction illustrations. 
 
 
 
(a) Early Turn Track and OEA Construction.  Where the early turn track from the 
FAC/CD intersection defines a turn less than or equal to 75 degrees relative to the FAC, the 
tie-back point is C (see chapter 5, figure 5-5); if the early track defines a turn greater than 75 
degrees relative to the FAC, tie-back to point D (see chapter 5, figure 5-7).  Where the early 
track represents a turn greater than 165 degrees (see chapter 5, figures 5-12 and 5-15), begin the 
early turn track and the 15-degree splay from the non-turn side TIA end + rr (chapter 2, formula 
2-4a) (PP’). 
 
 
 
 
 
Step 1:  Construct a line (defines the earliest-turn flight track), from the tie- 
back point to the fix.  See chapter 5, figures 5-9, 5-10, 5-14, and 5-15. 
 
 
 
 
 
Step 2:  Construct the outer primary and secondary OEA boundary lines 
parallel to this line (0.5-1.5-1.5-0.5 segment width).  See chapter 5, figures 5-9 and 5-10. 
 
 
 
 
 
Step 3:  From the tie-back point, construct a line splaying at 15 degrees to 
intersect the parallel boundary lines or segment end, whichever occurs earlier (see chapter 5, 
figures 5-9 and 5-10). 
 
 
 
 
 
Note:  Apply secondary areas only after the 15-degree splay line intersects 
the primary boundary line (see chapter 5, figures 5-9, 5-10, 5-13, etc). 
 
 
 
 
 
Step 3Alt:  Where Step 3 construction provides less than full-width 
protection at the DF fix, construct the OEA inner boundary with a line splaying from the tie-
back point at 15 degrees relative the direct-to-fix line, (or greater where required to provide 
full-width protection at the DF fix), until it intersects the parallel boundary lines (not later than 
tangent/tangent-extension to the full-width-arc about the fix), and provides full-width 
protection at or before the DF fix.  DF secondary areas begin/exist only where full width 
primary exists.  See chapter 5, figures 5-10, 5-14, and 5-15. 
 
Note:  Where excessive splay results (dependent upon various conditions but 
generally in the 20-25 degree range), consider modifying the segment to avoid 
protection and/or construction difficulties. 
 
 
 
 
(b) Late Turn Track and OEA Construction.  Apply WSs for late-turn outer 
boundary construction using the following calculations, construction techniques, and bank angles 
of 11 degrees or 14 degrees, as appropriate.

(c) Inside turn (Fly-By) Construction is predicated on the location of LL’ and 
primary/secondary boundary intersections (early turn connections), relative the outbound 
segment, see chapter 5, table 5-1.  (See chapter 5, figures 5-17 and 5-18). 
 
Where no inside turn secondary area exists in section 1, apply secondary areas only after the turn 
expansion line/s intersect the outbound segment boundaries. 
 
Apply the same technique to primary and secondary area connections when both inbound 
segment connection points fall either outside the outbound segment, or inside the outbound 
segment primary area.  When both inbound connection points are within the outbound segment 
secondary area or its extension, table 5-1 provides a connection method for each point. 
 
Note:  Where half-turn-angle construction is indicated, apply a line splaying at 
the larger of, half-turn-angle, or 15 degrees, relative the outbound track.  Where a 
small angle turn exists and standard construction is suitable for one, but not both 
splays; connect the uncommon splay, normally primary, to the outbound primary 
boundary at the same along-track distance as the secondary connection.  
Maintain or increase primary area as required. 
 
 
 
 
Step 1:  Construct a baseline (LL’) perpendicular to the inbound track at distance 
DearlyTP (chapter 5, formula 5-2h) prior to the fix (see chapter 5, figures 5-17 and 5-18). 
 
 
 
 
CASE 1:  The outbound segment boundary, or its extension, is beyond the baseline 
(early-turn connection points are prior to the outbound segment boundary), 
 
 
 
 
Step 1:  Construct the inside turn expansion area with a line, drawn at one-half the 
turn angle from the inbound segment primary early turn connection point, to intercept the 
outbound segment primary boundary (see chapter 5, figure 5-18). 
 
5-14 
03/10/2009 
 
8260.42B 
 
 
 
Step 2 (if required):  Construct the inside turn expansion area with a line, drawn at 
one-half the turn angle, from the inbound segment secondary early turn connection point, to 
intercept the outbound segment secondary boundary (see chapter 5, figure 5-18). 
 
 
 
 
CASE 2:  The outbound segment secondary boundary or its extension is prior to the 
LL’ baseline and outbound segment primary boundary or its extension is beyond the LL’ 
baseline, (early-turn connection points are both within the outbound segment secondary area or 
its extension). 
 
 
 
 
Step 1:  Construct the inside-turn expansion area with a line splaying at 15-degree, 
(relative the outbound track) from the inbound segment secondary early turn connection point to 
intersect the outbound segment boundary. 
 
 
 
 
Step 1Alt:  Where the turn angle exceeds 75 degrees, begin the splay from L’.  
 
 
 
 
Step 2:  Construct the primary boundary with a line, drawn at one-half the turn 
angle, from the inbound segment primary early turn connection point to intercept the outbound 
segment primary boundary (see chapter 5, figure 5-17). 
 
 
 
 
CASE 3:  The outbound segment secondary and primary boundaries, or their 
extensions, are prior to the LL’ baseline (primary early-turn connection point, or both 
connection points are inside the outbound segment primary area). 
 
 
 
 
Step 1:  Construct the inside turn expansion area with a line, splaying at 15-degree 
(relative the outbound track) from the more conservative point, (L’) or (the intersection of LL’ 
and the inbound segment inner primary boundary), to intersect the outbound segment boundaries. 
 
 
 
 
Step 1Alt:  Where the turn angle exceeds 75 degrees, begin the splay from L’.  
 
 
 
In this case, terminate the inside turn secondary area at the outbound segment 
primary boundary, since it falls before the early turn points, LL’ (see chapter 5, figure 5-18a). 
 
 
 
 
(d) Outside Turn (Fly-By) Construction. 
 
 
 
 
Step 1:  Construct the outer primary boundary using a radius of 1/2 primary width 
(1.5 NM), centered on the plotted fix position, drawn from the inbound segment extended 
primary boundary until tangent to the outbound segment primary boundary.  See chapter 5, 
figure 5-17. 
 
 
 
 
Step 2:  Construct the secondary boundary using a radius of one-half segment width 
(2 NM), centered on the plotted fix position, drawn from the inbound segment extended outer 
boundary until tangent to the outbound segment outer boundary (see chapter 5, figures 5-17, 
5-18, and 5-18a).  Where no inbound secondary exists, use an arc of radius one-half segment 
width from tangent to the outbound segment secondary boundary to terminate at the inbound 
segment boundary.

Step 2:  Refer to chapter 5, paragraph 3b(3)(c), (skip Step 1). 
 
 
 
 
(b) Outside Turn (Fly-Over) Construction.

Step 2:  Apply wind spiral outer boundary construction for the first MA fly-over 
turn.  See chapter 5, paragraph 3a(2)(b) for necessary data, using the higher of chapter 5, 
formula 5-2g output, or the assigned fix crossing altitude for TAS and turn radius calculations 
and chapter 5, paragraph 5 for wind spiral construction.  A non-turn side secondary area may 
extend into the WS1 area. 
 
 
 
 
(c) Obstacle Evaluations.  See chapter 5, paragraph 3b(4) 
 
 
 
(4) Section 2 Obstacle Evaluations. 
 
 
 
 
(a) Turn at an Altitude Section 2.  Apply the standard  MA OCS slope, (or the 
assigned CG slope) to section 2 obstacles based on the shortest primary area distance (do) from 
the TIA boundary to the obstacle.  Shortest primary area distance is the length of the shortest line 
kept within primary segments that passes through the early turn baseline of all preceding 
segments. 
 
 
 
 
Step 1:  Measure and apply the OCS along the shortest primary area distance (do) 
from the TIA boundary to the obstacle (single and multiple segments).  See various obstacle 
measurement examples in chapter 5, figures 5-19 through 5-22. 
 
 
 
5-16 
03/10/2009 
 
8260.42B 
 
 
 
Step 2:  For obstacles located in secondary areas, measure and apply the OCS along 
the shortest primary area distance (do) from the TIA boundary to the primary boundary abeam 
the obstacle, then the 4:1 slope along the shortest distance to the obstacle, (taken perpendicular to 
the nominal track or in expansion areas, to the primary arc, the primary corner-cutter, corner 
apex, or other appropriate primary boundary).  Where an obstacle requires multiple 
measurements (an obstacle is equidistant from multiple primary boundary points, or lies along 
perpendiculars from multiple primary boundary points, etc.), apply the more adverse result from 
each of the combined primary/secondary measurements.  See chapter 5, figures 5-19 through 
5-22. 
 
 
 
 
(b) Turn at Fix Section 2.  Apply an inclined OCS (MA OCS) slope, beginning at 
SOC at the inbound-segment end OCS height. 
 
 
 
 
Step 1:  Measure and apply the OCS along the shortest distance (do) from AB 
(parallel to track) to LL’, the shortest primary distance to the obstacle (single and multiple 
segments).  See chapter 5, figures 5-19 and 5-20, for various obstacle measurement examples. 
 
 
 
 
Step 2:  For obstacles located in secondary areas, measure and apply the OCS along 
the shortest primary area distance (do) from the TIA boundary to the primary boundary abeam 
the obstacle, then the 4:1 slope along the shortest distance to the obstacle, (taken perpendicular to 
the nominal track or in expansion areas, to the primary arc, the primary corner-cutter, corner 
apex, or other appropriate primary boundary).  Where an obstacle requires multiple 
measurements (where an obstacle is equidistant from multiple primary boundary points, or lies 
along perpendiculars from multiple primary boundary points, etc.), apply the more adverse result 
from each of the combined primary/secondary measurements (see chapter 5, figure 5-21). 
 
4. Turning Missed Approach (Second Turn). 
 
 
a. DF/TF Turn (Second Turn, following turn-at-altitude).  Turns at the DF path 
terminator fix will be fly-by or fly-over to a TF leg.  In either case, the outer boundary provides 
fly-over protection, and the inner boundary provides fly-by protection.  Maximum turn angle is 
90 degrees (applicable to both tracks within the DF segment).  This application provides that 
construction under chapter 2, or this chapter will apply, including cases where the inside and 
outside turn construction differs.

CASE 1:  Full width outside secondary exists at the early turn point (L’L’’). 
 
 
 
 
Step 1:  Construct a baseline (L’L’’) perpendicular to the inbound track nearer the 
non-turn side boundary at distance DearlyTP (chapter 5, formula 5-2h) prior to the fix. 
 
 
 
 
Step 2:  Apply chapter 2 criteria.  See chapter 5, figures 5-21 through 5-22. 
 
 
 
 
CASE 2:  Less than full width outside secondary exists at (L’L’’).

(2) DF/TF (Fly-Over) Turn. 
 
 
 
 
(a) Inside DF/TF (Fly-Over) Turn Construction. 
 
 
 
 
Step 1:  Construct a baseline (LL’) perpendicular to the inbound track nearer the 
turn side boundary at distance ATT prior to the fix (see chapter 5, figure 5-22). 
 
Note:  Where half-turn-angle construction is specified, apply a line splaying at 
the larger of half-turn-angle or 15 degrees relative the outbound track. 
 
 
 
 
CASE 1:  No inside secondary area exists at LL’. 
 
 
 
 
Step 1:  Create the OEA early-turn protection by constructing a line, splaying at the 
larger of one-half (1/2) the turn angle, or 15 degrees relative the outbound track, from the 
intersection of LL’ and the inbound segment inner primary boundary to connect with the 
outbound TF segment boundaries. 
 
The TF secondary area begins at the intersection of this diagonal line and the outbound segment 
boundary. 
 
 
 
 
CASE 2:  Partial width inside secondary area exists at LL’.  
 
 
 
 
Step 1:  Create the OEA early-turn primary area protection by constructing a line, 
splaying at the larger of one-half (1/2) the turn angle, or 15 degrees relative the outbound track, 
from the intersection of LL’ and the inbound segment inner primary boundary to connect with 
the TF segment primary boundary.

CASE 3:  Full width inside secondary area exists at LL’. 
 
 
 
 
Step 1:  Apply chapter 2 criteria.  See chapter 5, figure 5-21. 
 
 
 
 
(b) Outside DF/TF (Fly-Over) Turn Construction. 
 
 
 
Step 1:  Construct the late-turn baseline for each inbound track, (PP’) for the track 
nearer the inside turn boundary, and (P’P’’) for the outer track at distance (ATT + rr) beyond the 
fix, perpendicular to the appropriate inbound track.  See chapter 5, figure 5-22. 
Note:  A DF/TF Fly-Over turn is limited to 90 degrees (both inbound tracks) and 
should require no more than one WS per baseline.  Construct the outside track 
WS (WS1) on base line P’P’’, then construct WS2 on baseline PP’. 
 
 
 
Step 2:  Apply wind spiral construction, see chapter 5, paragraph 3a(2)(b) for 
necessary data, and chapter 5, paragraph 5 for wind spiral construction  See chapter 5, figure 
5-22. 
 
 
b. TF/TF Turn (Second Turn, following turn-at-fix).  Turns at the TF path terminator fix 
will be fly-by or fly-over to a TF leg.  In either case, the outer boundary provides fly-over 
protection, and the inner boundary provides fly-by protection.  Maximum turn angle is 90 
degrees.  This application provides that construction under chapter 2, or this chapter will apply, 
including cases where the inside and outside turn construction differs.

5. Wind Spiral Cases.  Wind Spiral (WS) construction applies to turn-at-an-altitude, turn-at-a-
fix (Fly-Over) for the first MA turn, and DF/TF (Fly-Over) for the second turn.  The late-turn 
line P’ designator is typically placed where the baselines cross.  Where baseline extension is 
required, mark each baseline inner end with P’.  Additional WS examples are available in Order 
8260.54. 
 
Each WS has several connection options along its boundary.  The chosen connection(s) must 
provide the more conservative reasonable track and protection areas (see chapter 5, figures 5-23 
through 5-25 for examples). 
 
• A 15-degree, (or greater*) splay line to join outbound segment outer boundaries, from: 
o WS/direct-to-fix tangent point 
o WS to WS tangent line origin 
o WS to WS tangent line end 
o WS/outbound segment parallel point (DF segment NA) 
 
• A tangent line to join the next WS (see chapter 5, figure 5-25) 
• A tangent line direct to the next fix (DF segment) (see chapter 5, figure 5-24) 
• A tangent line, converging at 30 degrees to the segment track (TF segment) (see chapter 
5, figure 5-20) 
 
*Note:  See chapter 5, paragraphs 5b(1) and 5b(2) for alternate connection details. 
 
Note:  Where multiple WSs exist, a line from the earlier WS splaying at 15 degrees 
relative the tangent line between WSs may produce the more conservative 
construction. 
 
Outbound segment type and turn magnitude are primary factors in WS application.  Refer to 
chapter 5, table 5-2 for basic application differences.  Calculate rr using chapter 2, formula 2-4a.

a. Turn-at-Fix (FO) and Turn-at-Altitude WS Comparison.  Three cases for outer-
boundary wind spirals commonly exist: 
 
• (Case 1), Small angle turns use one wind spiral (WS1); 
• (Case 2), Turns near/exceeding 90° ~ use a second wind spiral (WS2); and 
• (Case 3), turns near/exceeding 180° ~ use a third wind spiral (WS3). 
 
 
 
(1) Turn-at-Altitude WS application concludes with a line tangent to the final WS direct 
to the next fix. 
 
 
 
(2) Turn-at-Fix (FO) WS application concludes with a line tangent to the final WS 
converging at a 30-degree angle to the outbound segment nominal track.  The intersection of this 
line with the nominal track establishes the earliest maneuvering point for the next fix.  The 
minimum segment length is the greater of: 
 
• The minimum length calculated using the chapter 2 formulas or, 
• The distance from previous fix to the intersection of the 30-degree converging outer 
boundary line extension and the nominal track, (plus DTA).  See chapter 5, paragraph 
4a. 
 
 
 
(3)  Second MA Turn DF/TF Turn-at-Fix (FO) WS application concludes with a line 
tangent to the final WS converging at a 30-degree angle to the outbound segment nominal track.  
This construction requires two WS baselines, one for each inbound track.  Each late turn baseline 
is located (ATT + rr) beyond the fix, oriented perpendicular to the specific track.  The baseline 
for the inbound track nearer the inside turn boundary is designated PP’, the baseline associated 
with the outside turn track is designated P’P’’.  For convenience P’ is often placed at the 
intersection of the two baselines, but a copy properly goes with each baseline inner end if 
baseline extensions are required (see chapter 5, figure 5-22). 
 
 
b. First MA Turn WS Construction.  Find late turn point distance (Dlate TP) using 
chapter 5, formula 5-2j. 
 
 
 
(1) CASE 1:  Small angle turn using 1 WS. 
 
 
 
 
Step 1:  Construct the WS1 baseline, (PP’) perpendicular to the straight MA track at 
the late-turn-point (see chapter 5, table 5-2 for line PP’ location).  See chapter 5, figures 5-5 and 
5-8. 
 
 
 
 
Step 2:  Locate the wind spiral center on PP’ at distance R (no-wind turn radius, 
using chapter 5, formula 5-2b; see chapter 5, figure 5-8) from the intersection of PP’ and the 
inbound-segment outer-boundary extension (see chapter 5, figures 5-8 and 5-9). 
 
 
 
 
Step 3:  Construct WS1 from this outer boundary point in the direction of turn 
until tangent to the WS/Segment connecting line from chapter 5, table 5-2 (see chapter 5, 
figure 5-9). 
 
5-21 
03/10/2009 
 
8260.42B 
 
 
 
CASE 1-1:  Turn-at-Altitude (WS1 ends when tangent to a line direct to fix). 
 
 
 
 
Step 1:  Construct the OEA outer primary and secondary boundary lines parallel to 
this track (0.5-1.5-1.5-.0.5 segment width).  See chapter 5, figure 5-9. 
 
 
 
 
Step 2:  Construct a line from the WS1 tangent point, splaying at 15 degrees from 
the WS1-to-fix track until it intersects the parallel boundary lines or reaches the segment end 
(see chapter 5, figure 5-9). 
 
Note:  Consider ‘full-width protection at the fix’ to exist where the splay line is 
tangent to a full-width- radius- circle about the fix. 
 
 
 
 
Step 2Alt:  Where Step 2 construction provides less than full-width protection at the 
DF fix, construct the OEA outer boundary with a line splaying from the WS1/direct-to-fix 
tangent point at 15 degrees relative the direct-to-fix line, (or greater where required to provide 
full-width protection at the DF fix), until it intersects the parallel boundary lines (not later than 
tangent/tangent-extension to the full width-arc about the fix), and provides full-width protection 
at or before the DF fix. DF secondary areas begin/exist only where full width primary exists (see 
chapter 5, figure 5-9). 
 
Note:  Where excessive splay (dependent upon various conditions generally in 
the 35-40 degree range), consider lengthening the segment, restricting the speed, 
category, etc. to avoid protection and/or construction difficulties. 
 
 
 
 
CASE 1-2:  Turn-at-Fix (FO) (WS1 ends when tangent to a 30-degree line 
converging to nominal track). 
 
 
 
 
Step 1:  Construct the OEA outer boundary line using WS1 and the tangent 
30-degree converging line until it crosses the outbound segment boundaries (see chapter 5, 
figure 5-19). 
 
 
 
 
Step 1a:  Where WS1 lies within the outbound segment primary boundary, construct 
the OEA boundary using WS1 and a line (from the point WS1 is parallel to the outbound 
segment nominal track), splaying at 15 degrees relative the outbound segment nominal track 
until it intersects the outbound segment boundary lines. 
 
 
 
 
Step 1b:  Where WS1 lies within the outbound segment secondary boundary, 
construct the OEA boundary using WS1 and a line (from the point WS1 is parallel to the 
outbound segment nominal track), splaying at 15 degrees relative the outbound segment nominal 
track until it intersects the outbound segment boundary line.  Continue WS1 and the tangent 
30-degree converging line to establish the inner primary/secondary boundary (see chapter 5, 
similar figure 5-24). 
 
 
 
(2) CASE 2:  Larger turn using more than 1 WS.  For turns nearing or greater than 
90 degrees, WS2 may be necessary.  See chapter 5, figure 5-20. 
 
5-22 
03/10/2009 
 
8260.42B 
 
 
 
Step 1:  To determine WS2 necessity, locate its center on baseline PP’, at distance R 
from the inbound-segment inner-boundary extension. 
 
 
 
 
Step 2:  Construct WS2 from this inner boundary point in the direction of turn until 
tangent to the WS/WS, or WS/Segment connecting line from chapter 5, table 5-2.  See chapter 5, 
figure 5-20. 
 
 
 
 
Step 3:  Where WS2 intersects, or is outside WS1 construction, (including the 
connecting and expansion lines where appropriate), include WS2 in the OEA construction.  
Otherwise revert to the single WS construction. 
 
 
 
 
Step 3a:  Connect WS1 and WS2 with a line tangent to both (see chapter 5, figure 
5-20). 
 
Note:  The WS1/ WS2 tangent line should parallel a line between the WS center 
points. 
 
 
 
 
CASE 2-1:  Turn-at-Altitude (WS2 ends when tangent to a line direct to fix). 
 
 
 
 
Step 1:  Construct the OEA outer primary and secondary boundary lines parallel to 
this track (0.5-1.5-1.5.0.5 segment width). 
 
 
 
 
Step 2:  Construct a line from the WS2 tangent point, splaying at 15 degrees from 
the WS2-to-fix track until it intersects the parallel boundary lines or reaches the segment end 
(see chapter 5, figure 5-9). 
 
Note:  Consider ‘full-width protection at the fix’ exists where the splay line is 
tangent to a full-width- radius- circle about the fix. 
 
 
 
 
Step 2Alt:  Where Step 2 construction provides less than full-width protection at 
the DF fix, construct the OEA outer boundary with a line splaying from the WS2/direct-to-fix 
tangent point at 15 degrees relative the direct-to-fix line, (or greater where required to provide 
full-width protection at the DF fix), until it intersects the parallel boundary lines (not later than 
tangent/tangent-extension to the full-width-arc about the fix), and provides full-width 
protection at or before the DF fix.  Where the turn angle is ≤ 105 degrees, or the divergence 
angle between the WS/WS tangent line and the direct-to-fix line is ≤ 15 degrees, apply the 
splay line form the WS1/WS2 tangent line origin.  DF secondary areas begin/exist only where 
full width primary exists (see chapter 5, figure 5-9). 
 
Note:  Where excessive splay exists (dependent upon various conditions but 
generally greater than 30 degrees), consider using an earlier splay origin point, 
lengthening the segment, restricting the speed, category, etc. to avoid protection 
or construction difficulties (see chapter 5, paragraph 5 for origin points). 
 
 
 
 
CASE 2-2:  Turn-at-Fix (FO):  (WS2 ends when tangent to a 30-degree line 
converging to nominal track). 
5-23 
03/10/2009 
 
8260.42B 
 
 
 
Step 1:  Construct the OEA outer boundary line using WS2 and the 30-degree 
converging line until it crosses the outbound segment boundaries (see chapter 5, figure 5-20). 
 
 
 
 
Step 1a:  Where WS2 lies within the outbound segment primary boundary, 
construct the OEA boundary using WS1, WS2, and a line (from the point WS1 or WS2 is 
parallel to the outbound segment nominal track, the more conservative), splaying at 15 degrees 
relative the outbound segment nominal track until it intersects the outbound segment boundary 
lines. 
 
 
 
 
Step 1b:  Where WS2 lies within the outbound segment secondary boundary, 
construct the OEA boundary using WS1, WS2, and a line (from the point WS2 is parallel to the 
outbound segment nominal track), splaying at 15 degrees relative the outbound segment 
nominal track until it intersects the outbound segment boundary  line.  Continue WS2 and the 
tangent 30-degree converging line to establish the inner primary/secondary boundary. 
 
 
 
(3) CASE 3:  Larger turn using more than 2 WSs.  (Not applicable to Turn-at-Fix due 
to 90 degree turn limit).  For turns nearing or greater than 180 degrees  (such as a missed 
approach to a holding fix at the IF), 
 
 
 
 
Step 1:  Construct the WS3 baseline perpendicular to the straight MA track along 
CD-extended toward the turn side.  See chapter 5, figure 5-15. 
 
 
 
 
Step 2:  To determine WS3 necessity, locate its center on the WS3 baseline at 
distance R from point C.  See chapter 5, figure 5-15. 
 
 
 
 
Step 3:  Construct WS3 from point C in the direction of turn until tangent to the 
WS/WS, or WS/Segment connecting line from chapter 5, table 5-2.  See chapter 5, figure 5-15. 
 
 
 
 
Step 4:  Where WS3 intersects, or is outside WS2 construction, include WS3 in the 
OEA construction.  Otherwise revert to the dual WS construction.  See chapter 5, figure 5-15. 
 
 
 
 
Step 5:  Connect WS2 and WS3 with a line tangent to both.  See chapter 5, 
figure 5-15. 
 
Note:  The WS2 & WS3 tangent line should parallel a line between the WS center 
points. 
 
 
 
 
CASE 3-1:  Turn-at-Altitude: (WS3 ends when tangent to a line direct to fix) 
 
 
 
 
Step 1:  Construct the OEA outer primary and secondary boundary lines parallel to 
this track (0.5-1.5-1.5-0.5 segment width).  See chapter 5, figure 5-15. 
 
 
 
 
Step 2:  Construct a line from the WS3 tangent point, splaying at 15 degrees from 
the WS3-to-fix track until it intersects the parallel boundary lines or reaches the segment end.  
See chapter 5, figure 5-15.

(4) Outside Turn Secondary Area.  Outbound segment secondary areas following wind 
spirals begin where either the 30-degree converging line crosses the secondary and primary 
boundaries from outside the segment, or the 15-degree splay line crosses the primary boundary 
from inside the segment. 
 
 
c. Second MA Turn WS Construction (DF/TF FO).  To accommodate the two inbound 
tracks in the DF leg, the second MA turn DF/TF (fly-over) construction uses two WS 
baselines, PP’ and P’P’’. 
 
Note:  Apply chapter 5, table 5-2 PP’ location information for each baseline (formula is 
identical). 
 
 
 
(1) CASE 1:  Small angle turn using 1 WS for each inbound DF track. 
 
 
 
 
Step 1:  Construct the WS1 baseline, (P’P’’) perpendicular to the DF track nearer 
the outside of the DF/TF turn, at the late-turn-point.  See chapter 5, table 5-2 for line PP’ 
location. 
 
 
 
 
Step 1a:  Construct the WS2 baseline, (PP’) perpendicular to the DF track nearer 
the inside of the DF/TF turn, at the late-turn-point.  See chapter 5, table 5-2 for line PP’ 
location. 
 
 
 
 
Step 2:  Locate the WS1 center on P’P’’ at distance R (no-wind turn radius, using 
chapter 5, formula 5-2b; see chapter 5, figure 5-5) from the intersection of P’P’’ and the 
inbound-segment outer-boundary extension. 
 
 
 
 
Step 2a:  Locate the WS2 center on PP’ at distance R (no-wind turn radius, using 
chapter 5, formula 5-2b; see chapter 5, figure 5-5) from the intersection of PP’ and the 
inbound-segment inner-boundary extension. 
 
 
 
 
Step 3:  Construct WS1 from this outer boundary point in the direction of turn 
until tangent to the WS/Segment connecting line from chapter 5, table 5-2. 
 
 
 
 
Step 3a:  Construct WS2 from this inner boundary point in the direction of turn 
until tangent to the WS/Segment connecting line from chapter 5, table 5-2. 
 
 
 
 
Step 4:  Where WS2 intersects WS1 construction, include WS2 in the OEA 
construction, and connect WS1 to WS2 with a tangent line.  Otherwise revert to the single WS 
construction. 
 
 
 
 
CASE 1-1:  WS1 and/or WS2 lie outside the outbound segment boundary. 
 
 
 
 
Step 1:  Construct the OEA outer boundary using WS1 and/or WS2 and the tangent 
30-degree converging line until it crosses the outbound segment boundaries .  See chapter 5, 
figure 5-22. 
 
5-25 
03/10/2009 
 
8260.42B 
 
 
 
CASE 1-2:  WS1 and WS2 lie inside the outbound segment boundary. 
 
 
 
 
Step 1:  Where WS1 and/or WS2 lie inside the outbound segment primary 
boundary, construct the OEA outer boundary using WS1 and/or WS2 and a line (from the point 
WS1 or WS2 is parallel to the outbound segment nominal track), splaying at 15 degrees 
relative the outbound segment nominal track until it intersects the outbound segment boundary 
lines. 
 
 
 
 
Step 1a:  Where WS1 and/or WS2 lie inside the outbound segment secondary 
boundary, construct the OEA outer boundary using WS1 and/or WS2 and a line (from the point 
WS1 or WS2 is parallel to the outbound segment nominal track), splaying at 15 degrees 
relative the outbound segment nominal track until it intersects the outbound segment boundary 
line.  Continue the final WS and 30 degrees converging line to establish the primary/secondary 
boundary. 
 
6. Missed Approach Climb Gradient.  Where the MA standard OCS is penetrated and a CG is 
required, specify a missed approach CG to clear the penetrating obstruction.  MA starting ROC 
is 100 ft (plus adjustments).  ROC increases at 96 ft/NM, measured parallel to the MA track to 
TIA end (Turn-at-Altitude), or early-turn point (Turn-at-Fix), then shortest primary distance to 
the next fix.  Apply fix-to-fix distance for subsequent segments.  Where a part-time altimeter is 
in use, consider the helicopter SOC altitude to be the MDA associated with the local altimeter 
(ensures adequate CG is applied). 
 
 
 
 
Step 1:  Calculate the ROC, the altitude at which the ROC for the obstacle is 
achieved, and the required CG (ft/NM) using chapter 5, formula 5-13. 
 
 
 
 
Step 2:  Apply the CG to: 
 
• The altitude which provides appropriate ROC, or 
• The point/altitude where the subsequent MA OCS clears all obstacles. 
 
 
 
Step 2a:  Where a RASS adjustment is applicable for climb-to-altitude operations 
(prior to turn, terminate CG, etc.), apply the CG associated with the lower MDA (chapter 5, 
formula 5-3).  Where there is a local altimeter, to establish the RASS-based climb-to-altitude, 
add the difference between the local altimeter-based MDA and the RASS-based MDA to the 
climb-to-altitude and round to the next higher 100-ft increment (see Order 8260.3, Volume 1, 
chapter 3 for further details).

PinS Departures. 
a. Background operational information for procedure designers. The PinS Departure 
Procedures (DPs) described in this criteria allow a pilot to depart a heliport and visually navigate 
and avoid obstacles to the Initial Departure Fix (IDF) where IFR obstruction clearance begins. 
The IDF is a FB WP. IFR helicopter departure procedures will consist of a defined route in 
graphic form, published/charted as a standard instrument departure (SID) and comply with 
design and documentation guidelines as specified in this chapter and FAA Order 8260.46 
chapter 2, appendices A, C, D, and E. 
b. General Procedure Design. Establish the IDF at a distance from 1.5 NM to 5.0 NM 
from HRP for Public DPs, and 0.55 NM to 2.0 NM for Special DPs. PCG and obstruction 
clearance must be provided from the earliest ATT at the IDF to the latest ATT at the last DP WP

(DP termination fix) where the DP joins the en route structure and an altitude that permits 
en route flight. 
(1) Public DP Construction. Optimum leg length is 3.0 NM. If the magnitude (β) of the 
first turn is < 70 degrees, the minimum leg length allowed is 3.0 NM. If β of the first turn is 
> 70 degrees the minimum leg length is 3.5 NM. Maximum turn magnitude is 90 degrees and leg 
length is 10.0 NM. 
(2) Special DP Construction. The optimum leg length for Special helicopter DP 
construction is 3.0 NM. If β of the first turn angle is ≤ 30 degrees, the minimum leg length is 2.0 
NM, if β of the first turn angles are > 30 degrees the minimum leg length increases to 3.0 NM. 
Maximum value for β is 90 degrees and maximum leg length is 10.0 NM. 
(3) After the first turn fix, and expanding to full width, apply standard RNAV initial 
segment OEA construction for Category “A” aircraft. Minimum leg length is the greater of the 
current RNAV minimum leg length criteria or as construction requires after the first turn fix. 
(4) Use Formula 6-1 to determine turn radius (R) and DTA appropriate for . For a 
Public DP, use a design climb airspeed of 80 KIAS and a 13-degree bank angle until the climb 
trajectory reaches the target departure altitude. After the target departure altitude is reached, 
design for 140 KIAS and 15-degree bank angle. For a Special DP, use the best rate of climb 
airspeed (Vy), the cruising airspeed (Vc), and the design bank angle for Vy and Vc applicable to 
the specific design helicopter. 
(5) If lower or higher airspeeds are required because of design helicopter performance or 
equipment operating limitations, publish a speed restriction.

Obstacle Evaluation Area. The OEA consists of Section 1 (the IDF flat surface area), 
and Section 2 (the 20:1 sloping OCS), as shown in Figure 6-1. The JK line (end of section 1/ 
beginning of section 2) is a line perpendicular to the initial departure course that is a specified 
distance from the IDF:  1.5 NM (1 NM ATT + 0.5 NM FTE) for public DPs and 0.8 NM 
(0.3 NM ATT + 0.5 NM FTE) for Specials the construction radius around the IDF is 
1 NM ATT + 0.5 NM FTE = 1.5 NM for a Public DP and 0.3 NM + 0.5 NM FTE = 0.8 NM for a 
Special DP. A 15-degree splay defines the Section 1 and Section 2 outer boundaries as shown in 
Figure 6-1 below. The OEA entry is centered on the IDF and the route is constructed as a series 
of TF legs to the DP termination fix.

General Public PinS Departure Construction. For Public DP construction, OEA 
configuration is dependent on the course change angle at the first turn fix, and the length of the 
first segment. Some examples are illustrated in Figure 6-2 thru Figure 6-4. Instructions on how to 
define these cases (creating the specific OEAs and turn boundaries) are located in steps below:

Special PinS Departure Construction. When necessary to avoid obstacles, a Special DP 
may be constructed where the initial departure leg (only) is designed with an ATT value of 
0.3 NM (RNP/RNAV 0.3). 
For this construction, multiple OEA configurations can occur that are greatly affected by the 
course change angle and the length of the first departure segment. Some examples of these 
different scenarios are illustrated in Figure 6-20. Instructions on how to define these cases and 
create the resulting OEAs are located in this paragraph.

Obstacle Evaluation (OE). Starting at the JK line, apply a 20:1 OCS in the primary 
OEA, and a 6:1 OCS in the secondary OEA rising perpendicular from the edge of the primary 
area. Where an obstacle penetrates the primary OCS, or the *secondary OCS throughout the DP, 
calculate a minimum CG to clear the penetration(s) for all departure segments (legs) or raise the 
IDF crossing altitude. The highest required CG of all the departure legs is maintained until 
penetration(s) are cleared, and then the CG may be relaxed. See Figure 6-34 for a Climb Area 
Profile View and Figure 6-35/Figure 6-36 for a Climb Area Plan View. See paragraph 6-8 for 
assessing ROC, minimum altitude and CG. 
* The elevation of obstacles in the secondary is reduced.

Required Obstacle Clearance (ROC). 
a. Section 1 Obstacle Clearance. 
(1) The PinS DP minimum ROC at the IDF is 250 ft, plus any adjustments for RASS 
(when altimeter source greater than 5 NM from the IDF), precipitous terrain, and obstacle 
accuracy code. 
Note 1:  Precipitous terrain apply Section 1 only. 
 
Note 2:  IDF altitude must not be lower than the heliport elevation. 
 
(2) ROC is applied within the IDF flat surface area (Section 1), and then rounded to the 
next higher 100-ft increment. For example, 500 ft remains 500 ft and 501 ft becomes 600 ft. The 
rounded altitude is the IDF crossing altitude. 
(3) Accuracy Code. Obstacle accuracy code is 2C (50 ft horizontal/20 ft vertical) in the 
IDF flat surface area. 
b. Section 2 Obstacle Clearance. 
(1) Sloping OCS. ROC increases at 96 ft/NM for all climb gradients. 
(2) Primary OEA. Apply a 20:1 OCS originating at the JK line in the direction of 
departure. The OCS origin elevation is equal to the IDF crossing altitude subtracting ROC and 
any adjustments. 
(3) Secondary OEA. Apply a 6:1 OCS from the edge of the primary OEA. The OCS 
origin elevation is equal to the height of the primary OEA boundary directly abeam the obstacle 
and perpendicular to the segment track. For obstacles located within a turn OEA (see Figure 
6-37). 
(4) Obstacle evaluation. If the OCS is clear, then the standard CG (400 ft/NM) applies. If 
the OCS is not clear, then take the following actions: 
(a) Publish a CG to clear the penetration(s). CGs in excess of 600 ft/NM requires 
Flight Standards approval. 
(b) Alternatively, raise the IDF altitude to clear the penetration(s) to accommodate 
helicopters that cannot meet the non-standard climb gradient. 
Note:  This option will increase the ceiling value at the IDF. 
 
(c) Lastly, design another DP over a different route to achieve a lower CG. 
(5) Level Surface. The departure OCS continues to increase until reaching 1,000 ft  of 
ROC for non-mountainous regions (2,000 ft for mountainous regions) to the highest obstacle 
6-38 
11/20/2012 
 
8260.42B CHG 1 
located within the primary OEA (or secondary equivalent), and round the result to the next 
higher 100-ft increment. For example, 5,700 ft remains 5,700 ft and 5,701 ft becomes 5,800 ft. 
(6) Accuracy Code. The obstacle accuracy code for the 20:1 OCS area is 4D (250 ft 
horizontal/50 ft vertical). 
(7) Calculate the ROC over an obstacle, the altitude at which the ROC is achieved, and 
the resulting required CG using Formula 6-2.

6-10. Obstacle Distance Measurement. Obstacle distance (d) is measured using the shortest 
distance from each primary area obstacle to the JK line as illustrated in Figure 6-37 and Figure 
6-38. Secondary area obstacles that occur during turn expansions have an obstacle distance that 
begins at the JK line and ends at the point on the edge of the primary boundary closest to the 
obstacle. Secondary area obstacles that do not occur during turn expansion have an obstacle 
distance that begins at the JK line and ends at the point of intersection of a line perpendicular to 
the flight path passing through the obstacle and boundary of the primary area. Secondary area 
obstacle evaluations are further reduced based on their distances to the primary edge boundary as 
6-39 
11/20/2012 
 
8260.42B CHG 1 
shown in Formula 6-2. Detailed steps for obstacle distance measurements and calculations are 
found below: 
a. Obstacle in the Primary evaluation. Determine obstacle evaluation distance (d), as the 
shortest distance within the primary area from the obstacle to the JK line. 
b. Obstacle in the Secondary evaluation. 
(1) Determine the intersecting element of a line drawn from the obstacle to the closest 
point on the flight path. 
(a) If the intersecting element is an arc, determine the Obstacle Primary Point as the 
closest point on the primary boundary to the obstacle. 
(b) If the intersecting element is not an arc, determine the Obstacle Primary Point as 
the point of intersection between a line drawn from the obstacle perpendicular to the flight path 
and the Primary Boundary. 
(2) Determine obstacle evaluation distance (d), as the shortest distance within the primary 
area to from the Obstacle Primary Point to the JK line. 
(3) Determine distance into the secondary (dsecondary) as the distance from the obstacle to 
the Obstacle Primary Point.

6-11. Visual Segment (Specials only). To ensure a safe IFR operation from a heliport, it is 
essential to establish the acceptability of the landing site, to design a safe, flyable departure 
procedure, and to provide a flight inspection evaluation consistent with the type of operation. 
This paragraph provides the construction guidance for the visual segment of this type of 
procedure. 
a. Procedure design. The special procedure provides a measure of obstruction protection/ 
identification along the visual track from a specific VFR heliport to the IDF. 
Note:  In most cases the DP will be developed to utilize the waypoints of a corresponding 
Approach Procedure, resulting in the IDF being in the same location as the MAP. 
 
(1) Alignment. The visual segment connects the helipoint to the IDF. The optimum visual 
segment is aligned with the FAC. The course change at the IDF must not exceed 30 degrees. 
(2) Area. 
(a) Length. The visual segment OEA begins at the VSRL and ends at the IDF. The 
visual segment OEA maximum length is 2 NM, measured from the helipoint to the IDF plotted 
position. The optimum helipoint to the ATD/IDF fix distance is 0.65 NM. 
(b) Width. The visual segment splay begins at the VSRL. It splays from the VSRL 
endpoints to 0.6 NM either side of the IDF, perpendicular to the Initial IFR course. 
1. Straight Course Construction. Connect the VSRL outer edges (EF) to points B 
and D - 0.6 NM either side of the IDF, perpendicular to the Initial IFR course (see Figure 6-39).

2. Turn at the IDF Construction. Connect the VSRL outer edges (EF) to points B 
and D - 0.6 NM either side of the IDF, perpendicular to the Initial IFR course (see Figure 6-40). 
Figure 6-40. Visual Segment with Turn at IDF OEA 
 
 
(c) Visual Segment Climb Angle (VSCA). The VSCA is a developer-specified angle 
extending from a point 5 to 20 ft directly above the helipoint to the IDF altitude (see Figure 
6-41).

8260.42B CHG 1 
(d) Visual Segment OIS. The OIS begins at the VSRL and extends upward toward the 
IDF at an angle of (VSCA – 1 degree). The OIS rises to the point it reaches an altitude equal to 
the IDF altitude minus the ROC and adjustments, after which it becomes a level surface to the 
end of the IDF area. Measure obstacles using the shortest distance to the VSRL. Obstacles 
should not penetrate the OIS; if they penetrate in the initial evaluation; take one of the following 
actions, listed in preferential order (see Figure 6-42): 
1. Remove or adjust obstacle location and/or height to eliminate the penetration, 
or 
2. Raise the VSCA (Maximum 8.13°) to achieve an OIS angle that clears the 
obstacle, (verify that the helicopter meets this new climb performance), or 
3. Raise the HCH to ≤ 20 ft. Consult with the operator to determine ability of the 
helicopter fleet to hover at the adjusted HCH. When this procedure is applied, raise the OIS 
origin above the helipoint elevation by the amount that the HCH is increased (see Figure 6-42). 
Figure 6-42. VSCA and OIS Evaluation 
 
 
b. Charting requirements. 
(1) Publish the VSCA and climb gradient to the IDF. 
(2) Chart the obstructions required by the application of the attached criteria. 
(3) If the procedure is determined to be unusable at night, or night operations are not 
requested, annotate the procedure:  “Procedure NA at night.” 
6-12. Weather Minimums. Calculate ceiling and visibility weather minimums required for 
documenting the RNAV PinS DP on FAA Form 8260-15.

a. The minimum ceiling will correspond with the IFR MSL altitude required at the IDF 
rounded up to the next higher 100-ft increment, or the highest HRP elevation rounded up to the 
next higher 100-ft increment, whichever is higher. For example, 500 ft remains 500 ft and 501 ft 
becomes 600 ft. 
b. The visibility for a DP without a visual segment is in accordance with standard VFR 
minima. See FAA Form 8260-15 examples in FAA Order 8260.46, appendix F. 
c. The visibility for a Special DP with a visual segment is the greater of ¾ SM or the 
distance between the HRP and the IDF. Conduct an obstacle evaluation of the visual segment 
area, ensure that a satisfactory day/night flight validation is accomplished, and obtain Flight 
Standards approval of the Special DP.

Chapter 7.  Minimums for Helicopter Nonprecision 
RNAV amd WAAS Approaches  
 
1. Application.  Minimums specified for Category “A” aircraft in Order 8260.3, Volume 1, 
chapter 3, apply to helicopter RNAV procedures, except as follows:  For helicopter procedures to 
heliports or helipoints, substitute “helipoint elevation” for “airport elevation” and “height above 
threshold (HATh)” for “heliport crossing height (HCH).” 
 
 
a. Altitudes for IFR Approaches to IFR Heliports.  Heliport minimums are referenced to 
the helipoint elevation (HE). 
 
 
b. Visibilities for IFR Approaches to IFR Heliports and Runways. 
 
 
 
(1) Approaches to Lighted Heliports with a Heliport Approach Lighting System 
(HALS).  Apply Order 8260.37, table 3.  Apply Order 8260.3, Volume 1, chapter 3, table 3-5b 
for DoD helicopters. 
 
 
 
(2) Approaches to Runways.   Apply Order 8260.3, Volume 1, chapter 3, table 3-6 for 
civilian helicopters.  The minimum visibility may be ½ the computed values in table 3-6 but not 
less than ¼ sm/1.200 RVR.  Apply Order 8260.3, Volume 1, chapter 3, table 3-5b for DoD 
helicopters. 
 
Note 1:  For all procedures where obstacles penetrate Order 8260.3, Volume 1, 
chapter 3, paragraph 3.3.2 visual surfaces, visibility credit for approach lighting 
systems must not reduce visibility to values less than the values specified by 
paragraph 3.3.2 (3/4 or 1 SM as appropriate). 
 
Note 2:  For USA, when analyzing the visual position of the final approach 
segment and a penalty is encountered when applying the basic criteria in Order 
8260.3, Volume 1, paragraph 3.3.2, apply 20:1 vice 34:1 and 10:1 vice 20:1. 
 
 
c. IFR to a VFR Heliport (IVH) IFR to a VFR Runway (IVR). (Proceed Visually).  The 
minimum visibility is ¾ SM.  If the height above surface (HAS) exceeds 800 ft, the minimum 
visibility is 1 SM.  The minimum visibility must not be less than the distance from the plotted 
position of the MAP to the helipoint.  Nighttime Operations must be flight inspected and 
approved (see appendix A). 
 
 
d. PinS Approach (Proceed VFR).  The minimum visibility is ¾ SM.  If the height above 
surface (HAS) exceeds 800 ft, the minimum visibility is 1 SM.

Chapter 8.  HLPV PinS Final Approach Segment (FAS) Evaluation 
 
8-1. 
General. Helicopter specific LPV PinS criteria are based on chapter 2 OEA concepts; 
however, the LPV and LNAV procedure follows the same ground track and fixes and the 
along-track location of DA and the LNAV MAP are the same. For procedures annotated 
“Proceed VFR,” DA must be at least 250 ft above the terrain/surface and obstacles within a 
radius of 5,280 ft of the latest ATT point of the LNAV/LPV MAP/DA (see Figure 8-1 and 
Figure 8-2). For procedures annotated “Proceed Visually” DA must be at least 250 ft HAL.

Final Segment Obstruction Evaluation Area (OEA). The HLPV PinS final segment 
begins at the distance 1,154 ft from the RDP and extends to GPIP. The OEA protection extends 
the along-track segment dimension by the ATT value (40 m, 131.234 ft) at each end (see Figure 
8-3 and Figure 8-4).

a. Calculate the distance from RDP to PFAF using Formula 2-15 (coincident with 
LNAV PFAF). Minimum length is 3 NM and maximum 10 NM. When using Formula 2-15 
replace HCH with 0, and HRPelev with RDPelev.

b. Locate the FPAP 9,023 ft from RDP on a continuation of the final approach course 
(FAC), see Figure 8-5. The following are values entered into the procedure FAS data block (see 
paragraph 8-11). 
 
Distance RDP to FPAP = 9,023 ft 
 
Distance FPAP to GARP = 304.8 m (1,000 ft) 
 
Course Width at RDP = 106.75 m (350 ft)

c. OEA Alignment. The FAC is nominally aligned with landing site approach track 
extended ( 0.03°). Where a unique operational requirement indicates a need to offset the track 
from DA/MAP to the landing site from the track of the FAC, the offset must not exceed 
30 degrees measured at DA. 
d. OCS Slope. In this document, OCS slope is expressed as run over rise; e.g., 22.667:1.

e. OCS Origin and Elevation. For obstacle evaluation, the OCS originates 1,154 ft from 
(prior to) the RDP at the same elevation. Along-track distance measurements in the final segment 
OEA are from RDP. 
8-3. 
W OCS. All final segment OCS (W, X, and Y surfaces) obstacles are evaluated relative 
to the height of the W surface based on their along-track distance (OBSX) from RDP, 
perpendicular distance (OBSY) from the FAC centerline, and MSL elevation (OBSelev) adjusted 
for earth curvature and X/Y surface rise if appropriate. This adjusted elevation is termed obstacle 
effective elevation (OEE) and is covered in paragraph 8-3b. 
a. Half-Width. (Perpendicular distance from FAC centerline to surface boundary.) The 
perpendicular distance (Wboundary) from FAC centerline to the boundary is 400 ft at the point 
1,154 ft from RDP and expands uniformly to 2,200 ft at a point 51,154 ft from RDP then remains 
constant. Calculate Wboundary for any distance from RDP using Formula 8-2.

The glide path is a straight line in space extending from RDP. The OCS is; therefore, a flat plane
(does not follow earth curvature) to protect the straight-line glide path. The elevation of the OCS
at any point is the elevation of the OCS at the FAC centerline abeam it. Since the earth’s surface 
curves away from these surfaces as distance from RDP increases, the MSL elevation (OBSelev) 
of an obstacle is reduced to account for earth curvature. This reduced value is termed the 
obstacle effective elevation (OEE). Calculate OEE using Formula 8-4 with adjustment “Q” for 
“X” or “Y” surface rise (0 if in W Surface).

The descent rate of the adjusted glidepath angle should not exceed 800 ft/min. Descent rate is 
heavily dependent on airspeed. Determine the airspeed that yields 800 ft/min (VKIAS_800ft_min) for 
the adjusted glidepath angle using Formula 8-11. If VKIAS_800ft_min is less than the normal 
approach speed, publish a final approach airspeed restriction of VKIAS_800ft_min. The minimum 
adjusted glidepath angle should not be less than three degrees. If operationally required, with 
AFS approval, the maximum descent rate can be increased to 1,000 ft/min.

Missed Approach Section 1 (Height Loss and Initial Climb). Section 1 begins at DA 
(CD line) and ends at the AB line. It accommodates height loss and establishment of missed 
approach climb gradient. Obstacle protection is based on an assumed minimum climb gradient of 
400 ft/NM (≈15.19:1 slope). Section 1 is centered on a continuation of the FAC and is 
subdivided into sections 1a and 1b (see Figures 8-6 and 8-7).

a. Missed Approach Section 1. Section 1 begins at DA (CD line) and ends at the JK line 
which is the Start-Of-Climb (SOC) point. It accommodates reconfiguration, inherent height loss, 
and establishing required missed approach climb gradient (CGMA) of 400 ft/NM (20:1 slope), 
unless higher climb gradients and the appropriate slope adjustments are authorized. Section 1 is 
subdivided into sections 1a and 1b, and is centered on a continuation of the FAC. These surfaces 
must not be penetrated. Section 1a, is protected by a level surface that provides required ROC 
(ROCsec_1a) based on glide path angle and airspeed. ROC is 115 ft for glide path angles up to 
3.2 degrees. Apply ROC adjustments for glide path angles exceeding 3.2 degrees, for RDP 
elevations greater than 3,000 ft., and for final indicated airspeed. Calculate section 1a ROC 
(ROCsec_1a) and the level surface MSL elevation (sec_1aelev) using Formula 8-12.

Appendix A.  Conditions and Assumptions for IFR to  
VFR Heliport (IVH) (Proceed Visually) Approach Procedures 
 
Before designing a special RNAV (GPS) IFR to a VFR heliport (IVH) approach procedure, 
ensure the heliport meets the following criteria: 
 
1. FAA Form 7480-1, Notice of Landing Area Proposal, has been filed under Part 157. 
 
2. No penetration of the 8:1 surface in AC 150/5390-2 is permitted (see figure A-1).  
Penetrations of either A or B areas but not penetrations of both areas are allowed if the 
obstructions are charted, and marked or lighted and if not considered a hazard.  Use formula A-1 
to determine height of the 8:1 surface.

3. An acceptable onsite evaluation of the heliport for VFR use is required.  Order 8700.1, 
General Aviation Inspector’s Guide, chapter 61 is to be used for evaluation of the heliport.  
Based on the FAA determination, a procedure can be developed under the following conditions: 
 
 
a. No objection. 
A-1 
03/10/2009 
 
8260.42B 
 
 
Appendix A 
 
b. Conditional.  Conditions have been resolved by the proponent, e.g., obstacle penetrations 
of the 8:1 approach area, transitional and lateral extension areas, or pertain to the minimum size 
of the FATO, TLOF, and Safety Area. 
 
 
c. Objection.  If an objection determination is issued, an IVH approach procedure is not 
authorized to be developed.  A Point-in-Space (PinS) (Proceed VFR) approach procedure may be 
developed in accordance with chapter 5, paragraph 7. 
 
4. An acceptable evaluation of the visual segment for flyability, obstacles, and visual 
references must be completed in both day and night flight conditions.  The heliport or heliport 
visual references must be in clear view at the MAP, e.g., it cannot be completely obscured 
behind a building.  A heliport is the area of land, water or a structure used or intended to be used 
for the landing and takeoff of helicopters, together with appurtenant buildings and facilities.  
Buildings and facilities associated with the heliport such as hangers, administration buildings, 
AWOS equipment, windsock, beacon, etc. located within 500 ft are acceptable visual references.  
Surrounding buildings and land marks are not allowable visual references, unless approved by 
Flight Standards.  At least one of the following visual references must be visible or identifiable 
before the pilot may proceed visually: 
 
 
a. FATO or FATO lights. 
 
 
b. TLOF or TLOF lights. 
 
 
c. Heliport Instrument Lighting System (HILS). 
 
 
d. Heliport Approach Lighting System (HALS) or lead-in lights. 
 
 
e. Visual Glideslope Indicator (VGSI). 
 
 
f. Windsock or windsock light(s).* 
 
 
g. Heliport beacon.* 
 
 
h. Other facilities or systems approved by Flight Standards (AFS-400). 
 
*Note:  Windsock lights and heliport beacons should be located within 500 ft of the 
TLOF. 
 
5. IFR Approach to a VFR Heliport (IVH) Analysis.  The following analysis must be 
performed for authorizing an IVH procedure.  Obstacle clearance surface (OCS) areas are 
applied using concepts from Order 8260.3, Volume 1, chapter 2, paragraph 251a (1) with the 
following exceptions: 
 
 
a. Alignment is always centered on the visual segment centerline.

Purpose. 
 
The ellipsoidal formulas contained in this document must be used in determining 
RNAV flight path (GPS, RNP, WAAS, LAAS) fixes, courses, and distance between 
fixes. 
 
Notes: 
 
Algorithms and methods are described for calculating geodetic locations (latitudes and 
longitudes) on the World Geodetic System of 1984 (WGS-84) ellipsoid, resulting from 
intersections of geodesic and non-geodesic paths.  These algorithms utilize existing 
distance and azimuth calculation methods to compute intersections and tangent points 
needed for area navigation procedure construction.  The methods apply corrections to 
an initial spherical approximation until the error is less than the maximum allowable 
error, as specified by the user. 
 
Several constants are required for ellipsoidal calculations.  First, the ellipsoidal 
parameters must be specified.  For the WGS-84 ellipsoid, these are:

Note that the semi-major axis is derived from the semi-minor axis and flattening 
parameters using the relation

Second, an earth radius is needed for spherical approximations.  The appropriate radius 
is the geometric mean of the WGS-84 semi-major and semi-minor axes.  This gives  
SPHERE_RADIUS (r) = ab=6,367,435.679716 m . 
 
Perform calculations with at least 15 significant digits. 
 
For the purpose of determining geodetic positions, perform sufficient iterations to 
converge within 1 cm in distance and 0.002 arc seconds in bearing.

Introduction. 
 
The algorithms needed to calculate geodetic positions on the earth for the purpose of 
constructing and analyzing Terminal Instrument Procedures (TERPS) require the 
following geodetic calculation process some of which are illustrated in figure B-1:

Process 1:  Find the destination latitude and longitude, given starting latitude   
 
 
  and longitude as well as distance and starting azimuth (often  
 
 
 
  referred to as the “direct” or “forward” calculation). 
 
Process 2:  Compute the geodesic arc length between two points, along with   
 
 
  the azimuth of the geodesic at either point (often referred to as the   
 
 
  “inverse” calculation). 
 
Process 3:  Given a point on a geodesic, find a second geodesic that is   
 
 
 
  perpendicular to the given geodesic at that point. 
 
Process 4:  Given two geodesics, find their intersection point.  (Labeled “4”) 
 
Process 5:  Given two constant-radius arcs, find their intersection point(s).

  radius that is tangent to both geodesics and the points where  
 
 
 
  tangency occurs.  (Labeled “8”) 
 
Process 9:  Given an arc and a point, determine the geodesic(s) tangent to the   
 
   arc through the point and the point(s) where tangency occurs.   
 
 
   (Labeled “9”) 
 
Process 10: Given an arc and a geodesic, determine the geodesic(s) that are  
 
 
 
tangent to the arc and perpendicular to the given geodesic and the   
 
 
point(s) where tangency occurs.  (Labeled “10”)

2.1 
Data Structures. 
 
2.1.1 
Geodetic Locations.   
 
 
For convenience, one structure is used for both components of a geodetic coordinate.  
This is referred to as an LLPoint, which is declared as follows using C syntax: 
B-3 
03/10/2009 
 
8260.42B 
Appendix B 
( )
w P
P
 
typedef struct { 
 
 
latitude; 
 
 
longitude; 
 
} LLPoint; 
 
2.1.2 
Geodesic Curves. 
 
A geodesic curve is the minimal-length curve connecting two geodetic locations.  Since 
the planar geodesic is a straight line, we will often informally refer to a geodesic as a 
“line.”  Geodesics will be represented in data using two LLPoint structures. 
 
2.1.3 
Fixed Radius Arc.  
 
A geodetic arc can be defined by a center point and radius distance.  The circular arc is 
then the set (or locus) of points whose distance from the center point is equal to the 
radius.  If an arc subtends an angle of less than 360 degrees, then its start azimuth, end 
azimuth, and orientation must be specified.  The orientation is represented using a value 
of ±1, with +1 representing a counterclockwise arc and ‐1 representing a clockwise 
arc.  The distance between the start and end points must be checked.  If it is less than a 
predetermined tolerance value, then the arc will be treated like a complete circle. 
 
2.1.4 
Locus of Points Relative to a Geodesic.   
 
A locus of points relative to a geodesic is the set of all points such that the 
perpendicular distance from the geodesic is defined by a continuous function 
( )
w P  
which maps each point P on the geodesic to a real number.  For the purposes of 
procedure design, 
 will be either a constant value or a linear function of the 
distance from 
 to geodesic start point.  In the algorithms that follow, a locus of points 
is represented using the following C structure: 
 
 
 
typedef struct { 
 
 
   LLPoint geoStart;   /* start point of geodesic */ 
 
 
   LLPoint geoEnd;     /* end point of geodesic   */ 
 
 
   LLPoint locusStart; /* start point of locus    */ 
 
 
   LLPoint locusEnd;   /* end point of locus      */ 
 
 
   double startDist;   /* distance from geodesic  * 
 
 
                        * to locus at geoStart    */ 
 
 
   double endDist;     /* distance from geodesic  * 
 
 
                        * to locus at geoEnd      */ 
 
 
   int    lineType;    /* 0, 1 or 2               */ 
 
 
} Locus; 
 
The startDist and endDist parameters define where the locus lies in relation to 
the defining geodesic.  If endDist=startDist, then the locus will be described as 
being “parallel” to the geodesic, while if endDist≠startDist, then the locus is 
“splayed.”  Furthermore, the sign of the distance parameter determines which side of 
the geodesic the locus is on.  The algorithms described in this paper assume the 
following convention:  if the distance to the locus is positive, then the locus lies to the 
B-4 
03/10/2009 
 
8260.42B 
Appendix B 
right of the geodesic; if the distance is negative, then the locus lies to the left.  These 
directions are relative to the direction of the geodesic as viewed from the geoStart 
point.  See figure B-2 for an illustration.  
 
If memory storage is limited, then either the startDist/endDist or 
locusStart/locusEnd elements may be omitted from the structure, since one 
may be calculated from the other.  However, calculating them once upon initialization 
and then storing them will reduce computation time. 
 
The lineType attribute is used to specify the locus’s extent.  If it is set to 0 (zero), 
then the locus exists only between geoStart and geoEnd.  If lineType=1, then 
the locus begins at geoStart but extends beyond geoEnd.  If lineType=2, then 
the locus extends beyond both geoStart and geoEnd.

Basic Calculations. 
 
3.1 
Iterative Approach.   
 
 
For most of the intersection and projection methods listed below, an initial 
approximation is iteratively improved until the calculated error is less than the required 
accuracy.  The iterative schemes employ a basic secant method, relying upon a linear 
approximation of the error as a function of one adjustable parameter. 
 
To begin the iteration, two starting solutions are found and used to initialize a pair of 
two-element arrays.  The first array stores the two most recent values of the parameter 
being adjusted in the solution search.  This array is named distarray when the 
search parameter is the distance from a known point.  It is named crsarray when the 
search parameter is an angle measured against the azimuth of a known geodesic.  The 
second array (named errarray in the algorithms below) stores the error values 
corresponding to the two most recent parameter values.  Thus, these arrays store a 
B-5 
03/10/2009 
 
8260.42B 
Appendix B 
linear representation of the error function.  The next solution in each iteration is found 
by solving for the root of that linear function using the findLinearRoot function: 
 
 
static double findLinearRoot(double* x, double* y,  
long* err) { 
if (x[0] == x[1]) { 
/* function has duplicate x values, no root */ 
return x[0]; 
}  
else if (y[0] == y[1]) {  
if (y[0]*y[1] == 0.0) { 
return x[0]; 
}  
/* duplicate y values in root function */ 
return 0.5*(x[0]+x[1]); 
}  
return -y[0]*(x[1]-x[0])/(y[1]-y[0]) + x[0] 
 
} 
 
This function returns the value of the search parameter for which the linear error 
approximation is zero.  The returned root is used as the next value in the adjustable 
parameter and the corresponding error value is calculated.  Then the parameter and 
error arrays are updated and another new root is found.  
 
This iteration scheme works well for the algorithms described in this paper.  Conver-
gence is achieved very quickly because each starting solution is very close to the final 
solution, where the error is well approximated by a linear function. 
 
3.2 
Starting Solutions. 
 
 
Starting solutions must be provided to start iterating toward a precise solution.  Initial 
solutions may be found in all cases by using spherical triangles to approximate the 
geodetic curves being analyzed, and then solve for unknown distance and azimuth 
values using spherical trigonometry formulas.

Tolerances. 
3
 
Two different convergence tolerances must be supplied so that the algorithms cease 
 and 
 
iterating once the error becomes sufficiently small.  The first tolerance parameter is 
used in the forward and inverse routines; it is referred to as eps in the algorithm 
descriptions.  The second parameter, labeled tol, is used in the intersection and 
projection routines to limit the overall error in the solution.  Since the intersection
projection routines make multiple calls to the inverse and forward algorithms, the eps 
parameter should be several orders of magnitude smaller than the tol parameter to 
ensure that the iteration methods return correct results.  Empirical studies have shown
that eps = 0.5e-13 and tol = 1.0e-9 work well. 
 
Finally, a maximum iteration count and convergence tolerances must be supplied to 
.  
ensure that no algorithms can remain in an infinite loop if convergence is not reached
This parameter can be set by the programmer, but should be greater than five to ensure 
that all of the algorithms can reach convergence.

Geodesic Oriented at Specified Angle. 
 
 
In TERPS procedure design, it is often required to find a geodesic that lies at a 
prescribed angle to another geodesic.  For instance, the end lines of an obstacle 
evaluation area (OEA) are typically projected from the flight path at a prescribed angle.  
Since the azimuth of a geodesic varies over the length of the curve, the angle between 
two geodesics must be measured by comparing the azimuth of each geodesic at the 
point where they intersect.  The following pseudo-code represents an algorithm that 
will calculate the correct azimuth at any point on a geodesic described by its start and 
end points. This azimuth can easily be extended to find the azimuth of an intersecting 
geodesic at the point if the angle of intersection is known.

STEP 3: Use Inverse algorithm to determine course and distance from testPt to 
endPt. Denote course as crsToEnd. 
 
STEP 4: If testPt lies on geodesic between startPt and endPt, then the correct 
azimuth is crsToEnd. 
 
STEP 5: If testPt lies on the geodesic beyond endPt, then the correct azimuth is 
crsStart + π. 
 
STEP 6: Return the calculated azimuth. 
 
Note that if angle is positive, then the new geodesic will lie to the right of the given 
geodesic (from the perspective of standing at the start point and facing toward the end 
point); otherwise, the new geodesic will lie to the left.

Determine If Point Lies on Geodesic. 
 
This algorithm returns a true value if a point lies on and within the bounds of a given 
geodesic.  The bounds of the geodesic are specified by two pieces of information:  the 
end point coordinates and an integer length code.  If the length code is set to 0, then the 
geodesic is understood to exist only between its start and end points, so a value of true 
will be returned only if the test point also lies between the start and end points.  If the 
length code is set to 1, then the geodesic is understood to extend beyond its end point to 
a distance of one half of earth’s circumference from its end point.  If the length code is 
set to 2, then the geodesic is understood to extend beyond both the start and end points.

Note that this algorithm relies on the concept of equality for two LLPoint structures.  
This will be defined to mean that the distance between the two LLPoints, as 
calculated using the inverse algorithm, is less than tol.

Determine If Point Lies on Arc. 
 
This algorithm returns a non-zero (true) value if the sample point lies on and between 
the bounds of the given arc.  The arc is defined by its center point, radius, start azimuth, 
end azimuth, and orientation.  A positive orientation parameter indicates that the arc is 
traversed in a counterclockwise sense, while a negative orientation parameter indicates 
that the arc is traversed clockwise.  This algorithm is used in conjunction with the arc 
intersection functions (Algorithms 4.2, 4.3, and 4.6) to determine whether the computed 
intersections lie within the bounds of the desired arc.

Calculate Length of Fixed Radius Arc. 
 
A fixed radius arc on an ellipsoid does not generally lie in a plane.  Therefore, the 
length of the arc cannot be computed using the usual formula for the circumference of a 
circle.  The following algorithm takes the approach of dividing the arc into many sub-
arcs.  Three points are then calculated on each sub-arc.  Since any three points in space 
uniquely determine both a plane and an arc, the three points on each sub-arc are used to 
calculate the radius and subtended angle of the planar arc that contains all three points.  
The length of the approximating planar arc is then calculated for each sub-arc.  The 
sum of the sub-arc lengths approaches the length of the original arc as the number of 
sub-arc increases (and each sub-arc’s length decreases). 
 
A simpler method that is sufficiently accurate for arcs with radius less than about 
300 nautical miles (NM) is described in section 6.4.

STEP 1: Set initial number of sub-arcs to use.  The fixed value n = 16 has been found 
 
through trial-and-error to be a good starting value.  Alternatively, the initial 
 
value of n may be calculated based on the arc’s subtended angle and its 
 
radius (i.e., its approximate arc length). 
 
STEP 2: Convert center point to Earth-Centered, Earth-Fixed (ECEF) coordinates, 
 
v0 according to Algorithm 6.1. 
 
STEP 3: Compute subtended angle, subtAngle, using Algorithm 6.0. 
 
STEP 4: Set iteration count, k = 0. 
 
STEP 5: Do while k = 0 or ((error > tol) and (k ≤ maximumIterationCount)).

Find Distance from Defining Geodesic to Locus. 
 
When computing a position on a locus of points, it is necessary to solve for the distance 
from the defining geodesic to the locus.  This distance is constant if the locus is 
B-24 
03/10/2009 
 
8260.42B 
Appendix B 
designed to be “parallel” to the defining geodesic.  However, it is necessary to allow the 
locus distance to vary linearly with distance along the geodesic, since in some cases the 
locus will splay away from the defining geodesic.  To account for this, we have 
included startDist and endDist attributes in the Locus structure defined above.  
For a given point on the geodesic (or given distance from the geodesic start point), the 
distance to the locus can then be calculated. 
 
The two algorithms described below carry out the computation of locus distance for 
different input parameters.  If the distance from the geodesic start point to the point of 
interest is known, then WGS84DistToLocusD may be used to calculate the locus 
distance.  If instead a point on the defining geodesic is given, the 
WGS84DistToLocusP may be used.  The latter algorithm simply computes the 
distance from the geodesic start point to the given point and then invokes the former 
algorithm.  Therefore, steps are described for WGS84DistToLocusD only.

The following steps are followed if the distance from loc.geoStart is given.  If 
a point on the geodesic (geoPt) is given instead, then first use the inverse algorithm to 
compute the distance from geoPt to loc.geoStart and then follow the 
following steps (note that distance must be signed negative if the locus’s line type is 
2 and geoPt is farther from geoEnd than it is from geoStart): 
 
STEP 1: Use the inverse function to compute the length of the locus’s defining

Determine if Point Lies on Locus. 
 
This algorithm compares the position of a given point with the position of the 
corresponding point on the locus.  The corresponding point on the locus is found by 
projecting the given point onto the locus’s defining geodesic curve, computing the 
correct distance from there to the locus, and then projecting a point at that distance 
perpendicular to the geodesic.  If distance from the corresponding point to the given 
point is less than the error tolerance, then a reference to the projected point on the 
geodesic is returned.  Otherwise a null reference is returned. 
 
An alternative implementation could simply return true or false, rather than references.  
However, it is more efficient to return the projected point as this is often needed in 
subsequent calculations.

STEP 1: If testPt is the same as loc.geoStart or loc.geoEnd then return a 
 
reference to ptOnGeo containing the appropriate point. 
 
STEP 2: Use Algorithm 5.1 to project testPt onto the locus’s defining geodesic.   
 
 
Denote the projected point as ptOnGeo. 
 
STEP 3: Use Algorithm 3.6 to determine whether ptOnGeo lies on the locus’s   
 
 
defining geodesic.  This will account for an infinite or semi-infinite locus.  If  
 
 
it does not, then return 0 (false). 
 
STEP 4: Use the Inverse Algorithm to find the course between loc.geoStart and  
 
 
testPt. Use this course to determine which side of the locus testPt falls.  
 
 
Apply the appropriate sign to this distance, distFromPoint. 
 
STEP 5: Use Algorithm 3.9 to calculate the correct expected locus distance, locDist.

Algorithm Steps. 
 
See figure B-9 for an illustration of the variables. 
 
STEP 1: 
Use Algorithm 3.11 to determine whether testPt lies on loc.  This same 
 
step will return a reference to the projection of testPt onto the defining 
 
geodesic.  Denote this reference as geoPt.  
 
STEP 2: 
If (geoPt = NULL) then testPt is not a valid point at which to 
calculate the locus’s course.  Return -1.0.  (Valid course values are in the 
range  [
]
0,2π .) 
 
STEP 3: 
Use the inverse algorithm to calculate the course and distance from 
 
testPt to geoPt, denoted by perpCrs and perpDist, respectively. 
 
STEP 4: 
Use Algorithm 3.9 to calculate distToLoc, the distance from the 
 
geodesic to the locus at geoPt.  This step is required to determine which 
 
side of the  geodesic the locus lies on because perpDist will always be 
 
positive. 
 
STEP 5: 
Calculate the slope of the locus relative to the geodesic: 
 
(
slope= loc.endDist-loc.startDist)
geoLen 
 
STEP 6: 
Convert the slope to angular measure in radians:  
 
(
)
slope
= atan slope
 
 
STEP 7: 
Adjust the value of the perpendicular course by slope.  This accounts for 
 
how the locus is approaching or receding from the geodesic: 
 
perpCrs=perpCrs+slope  
 
STEP 8: 
If (distToLoc < 0), then testPt lies to the left of the geodesic, so 
 
perpCrs  points to the right of the locus’s course: 
 
 
 
π 2  
=
−
locCrs
perpCrs
 
 
STEP 9: 
Else, testPt lies to the right of the geodesic so perpCrs points to the 
 
left of the locus’s course:

locCrs =
perpCrs+
 
 
STEP 10: Return locCrs

The following algorithm computes the coordinates where two geodesic curves intersect.

Algorithm Steps. 
 
See figure B-10 for an illustration of the variables.  
 
STEP 1: 
Use inverse algorithm to calculate distance, azimuth and reverse azimuth  
 
from pt1 to pt2.  Denote these values by dist12, crs21 and 
 
crs12, respectively. Run a check to see if pt1 lies on the geodesic defined  
 
by pt2 and crs23 and if pt2 lies on the geodesic defined by pt1 and 
 
 crs13. 
 
a. If pt1 falls on geodesic 2 and pt2 falls on geodesic 1. 
 
 
 
 
(1) Return an error. Courses are collinear. There are infinite  
 
 
 
intersections. 
 
 
 
b. If pt1 falls on geodesic 2. 
 
 
 
 
(1) Return intersection = pt1. 
 
 
 
c. If pt2 falls on geodesic 1. 
 
 
 
 
(1) Return intersection = pt2. 
 
STEP 2: 
Calculate the signed azimuth difference in angle between crs12 and 
 
crs13, denoted by angle1. 
 
STEP 3: 
Calculate the signed azimuth difference in angle between crs21 and 
 
crs23, denoted by angle2. 
 
STEP 4: 
If (sin(angle1)*sin(angle2) < 0) then the courses lay on opposite 
sides of the pt1-pt2 line and cannot intersect in this hemisphere. Use 
reciprocal course so that the nearest intersection may be found.

a. If abs(angle1) > abs(angle2) 
 
 
 
(1) angle1 = (crs13+π) - crs12 
 
 
b. Else 
 
 
 
(1)  angle2 = crs21 - (crs23+π) 
 
STEP 5: 
End if. 
 
STEP 6: 
Locate the approximate intersection point, intx, using a spherical earth 
 
model. See the documents referenced in section 2.2 methods to 
 
accomplish this. 
 
STEP 7:    The following steps describe the function iterateLineIntersection 
which is called once the initial approximation, intx, of the line 
intersection is found. The purpose of the iterateLineIntersection 
function is to further refine the solution. 
 
STEP 8:        Use the inverse algorithm to calculate dist13, the distance from pt1 to  
    intx. 
 
STEP 9:        Use the inverse algorithm to calculate dist23, the distance from pt2 to 
          intx. 
 
STEP 10:       If dist13 < tol, then the intersection point is very close to pt1.   
 
          Calculation errors may lead to treating the point as if it were beyond the end  
 
          of the geodesic.  Therefore, it is helpful to move pt1 a small distance along  
 
          the geodesic. 
 
1. Use the direct algorithm to move pt1 from its original coordinates 1 
nm along azimuth crs13 + π. 
2. Use the inverse algorithm to calculate the azimuth acrs13 for the 
geodesic from the new pt1. 
STEP 11:      Repeat steps 10, 10(1), and 10(1) for pt2 and crs23.  
STEP 12:      If (dist23 < dist13) then the intersection point is closer to pt2 than  
 
         pt1.  In this case, the iterative scheme will be more accurate if we swap 
               pt1 and pt2.  This is because we iterate by projecting the approximate  
 
         point onto the geodesic from pt1 and then calculating the error in azimuth  
               from pt2.  If the distance from pt2 to the intersection is small, then small  
 
         errors in distance can correspond to large errors in azimuth, which will lead  
 
         to slow convergence.  Therefore, we swap the points so that we are always  
               measuring azimuth errors farther from the geodesic starting point.

End if 
STEP 14: 
Initialize the distance array:  distarray[0] = dist13.  
Errors in azimuth from pt2 will be measured as a function of distance 
from pt1.  The two most recent distances from pt1 are stored in a two 
element array.  This array is initialized with the distance from pt1 to 
intx:  
STEP 15: 
Use the direct algorithm to project intx onto the geodesic from pt1.  
Use pt1 as the starting point, and a distance of distarray[0] and 
azimuth of crs13. 
STEP 16: 
Use the inverse algorithm to measure the azimuth acrs23 from pt2 to

STEP 18: 
Initialize the second element of the distance array using a logical guess: 
distarray[1]=1.01*dist13. 
STEP 19: 
Use the direct algorithm to project the second approximation of intx 
onto the geodesic from pt1.  Use pt1 as the starting point, and a distance 
of distarray[1] and azimuth of crs13. 
STEP 20:

STEP 23: 
Do while (k=0) or ((error > tol) and (k ≤ MAX_ITERATIONS)) 
a. Use linear approximation to find root of errarray as a function of 
distarray.  This gives an improved approximation to dist13. 
b. Use the direct algorithm to project the next approximation of the 
intersection point, newPt, onto the geodesic from pt1.  Use pt1 as 
the starting point, and a distance of dist13 (calculated in previous 
step) and azimuth of crs13. 
c. Use inverse algorithm to calculate the azimuth acrs23 from pt2 to 
intx. 
d. Use the inverse algorithm to compute the distance from newPt to 
intx (the previous estimate).  Denote this value as the error for 
this iteration. 
e. Update distarray and errarray with new values: 
distarray[0] = distarray[1] 
distarray[1] = dist13 
errarray[0]  = errarray[1] 
errarray[1]  = signedAzimuthDifference(acrs23,crs23) 
 
f. Increment k: k = k + 1 
STEP 24: 
End while loop 
STEP 25: 
Check if k reached MAX_ITERATIONS.  If so, then the algorithm may 
not have converged, so an error message should be displayed. 
STEP 26: 
The distances and azimuths from pt1 and pt2 to intx are available at 
the end of this function, since they were calculated throughout the 
iteration.  It may be beneficial to return them with the intx coordinates, 
since they may be needed by the calling function.  If this is done, and if 
swapped = 1, then the original identities of pt1 and pt2 were 
exchanged and the azimuths and distances must be swapped again before 
they are returned. 
STEP 27: 
Return intx.

This algorithm treats the arcs as full circles.  Once the intersections of the circles are 
found, then each intersection point may be tested and discarded if it does not lie within 
the bounds of the arc.

respectively. 
 
STEP 2: 
If (radius1 + radius2 –dist12 + tol < 0) or 
 
(abs(radius1-radius2) > dist12) then the circles are spaced 
 
such that they do not intersect.  If the first conditional is true, then the arcs 
 
are too far apart.  If the second conditional is true, then one arc is contained 
 
within the other. 
 
 
a. Return no intersections.

Intersections of Arc and Geodesic. 
 
The following algorithm computes the point where a geodesic intersects an arc.  The 
geodesic is defined by its starting coordinates and azimuth.  The arc is defined by its 
center point coordinates and radius.  The algorithm will return a null solution (no 
points) if the arc and geodesic do not intersect; it will return a single set of coordinates 
if the arc and geodesic intersect tangentially; and it will return two sets of coordinates if 
the arc and geodesic overlap.

4.3.2 
Algorithm Steps. 
 
This algorithm treats the arc and geodesic as unbounded.  Once intersection points are 
found, they must be tested using Algorithms 3.6 and 3.7 to determine which, if any, lie 
within the curves’ bounds.  This algorithm fails if the arc and geodesic describe the 
same great circle.  A test for this case is embedded in step 7.  See figure B-12 for an 
illustration of the variable names.  
 
STEP 1: 
Use Algorithm 5 .1 to find the perpendicular projection point from arc  
 
center point (center) to the geodesic defined by starting point pt1 and 
 
azimuth crs1.  Denote this point by perpPt. Denote the distance as  
 
 
perpDist. 
 
STEP 2: 
Use inverse Algorithm to calculate the azimuth of the geodesic at perpPt.  
 
Denote the azimuth from perpPt to pt1 as crs. 
 
STEP 3: 
If (abs(perpDist – radius) < tol), then the geodesic is tangent 
to the arc and intersection point is at perpPt. 
 
 
a. Return intx[0] = perpPt 
 
STEP 4: 
Else if (perpDist > radius) then geodesic passes too far from center  
 
of circle; there is no intersection.

a. Return empty array. 
 
STEP 5: 
End if 
 
STEP 6: 
Use spherical triangle approximation to find distance from perpPt to one 
 
intersection points.  Since the spherical triangle formed from center, 
 
perpPt, and either intersection point has a right angle at the perpPt 
 
vertex, the distance from perpPt to either intersection is: 
 
 
dist = SPHERE_RADIUS*acos(cos(radius/SPHERE_RADIUS)/ 
 
 
 
    cos(perpDist/SPHERE_RADIUS) ) 
 
where SPHERE_RADIUS is the radius of the spherical earth approximation. 
 
Note that a test must be performed so that if 
cos(perpDist/SPHERE_RADIUS) = 0, then no solution is returned 
 
STEP 7: 
Find ellipsoidal approximation intx[0] to first intersection by starting 
 
at perpPt and using direct algorithm with distance dist and azimuth 
 
crs.  This will place intx[0] on the geodesic. 
 
STEP 8: 
Initialize iteration count k = 0. 
 
STEP 9: 
Use inverse algorithm to calculate the distance from center to intx[0]. 
 
Denote this value by radDist. In the same calculation, calculate azimuth 
 
from intx[0] to center.  Denote this value by rcrs; it will be used 
 
to improve the solution. 
 
STEP 10: Calculate error for this iteration: error = radius – radDist 
 
STEP 11: Initialize arrays that will hold distance and error function values so that 
 
linear interpolation may be used to improve approximation: 
 
distarray[0] = dist 
 
errarray[0] = error 
 
STEP 12: Do one iterative step using spherical approximation near intersection 
 
point (see figure B-13). 
 
 
 
a. Use the inverse algorithm to calculate the azimuth from intx[0] to  
 
 
perpPt.  Denote this value by bcrs. 
 
 
b. Compute the angle between the arc’s radial line and the geodesic at  
 
 
intx[0].  This is depicted by B in figure B-13:  
 
B=abs(signedAzimuthDifference(bcrs, rcrs)

Appendix B 
 
c. Calculate the angle opposite the radial error: 
 
   A=acos[sin(B)*cos(abs(error)/sphereRad)] 
 
 
d. If (abs(sin(A)) < eps) then the triangle is nearly isosceles, so  
 
 
use simple formula for correction term c: c = error 
 
 
e. Else, if (abs(A) < eps) then the error is very small, so use flat  
 
 
approximation: c = error/cos(B) 
 
 
f. Else, use a spherical triangle approximation for c:  
  
 
c=sphereRad*asin[sin(error/sphereRad)/sin(A)] 
 
 
 
 
 
 
g. End if 
 
 
h. If (error > 0), then intx[0] is inside the circle, so approximation  
 
 
must be moved away from perpPt:  dist = dist + c 
 
 
i. Else dist = dist - c 
 
 
j. End if 
 
 
k. Use the direct algorithm to move intx[0] closer to solution.  Use  
 
 
perpPt as the starting point with distance dist and azimuth crs. 
 
 
l. Use the inverse algorithm to calculate the distance from center to  
 
 
intx[0].  Denote this value again as radDist. 
 
 
m. Initialize second value of distarray and errarray: 
 
 
distarray[1] = dist  
 
 
errarray[1]  = radius-radDist 
 
STEP 13: Do while (abs(error) > tol) and (k <maximumIterationCount) 
 
 
a. Use a linear root finder to find the distance value that corresponds to  
 
 
zero error.  Update the variable dist with this root value. 
 
 
b. Use the direct algorithm again to move intx[0] closer to solution.   
 
 
Use perpPt as the starting point with distance dist and azimuth crs. 
 
 
c. Use the inverse algorithm to calculate the distance from center to  
 
 
intx[0].  Denote this value radDist. 
 
 
d. Update distarray and errarray with the new values: 
 
 
distarray[0] = distarray[1]  
 
 
errarray[0]  = errarray[1] 
 
 
distarray[1] = dist  
 
 
errarray[1]  = error

e. Increment the iteration count: k = k + 1 
 
STEP 14: End while loop 
 
STEP 15: Prepare variables to solve for second solution, intx[1]. 
 
 
a. Second solution lies on other side of perpPt, so set crs = crs + 
π. 
 
 
b. Use direct algorithm to find intx[1].  Start at perpPt, using crs for 
the azimuth and dist for the distance, since the distance from perpPt 
to intx[0] is a very good approximation to the distance from 
perpPt to intx[1]. 
 
 
c. Use inverse algorithm to calculate radDist, the distance from 
center to intx[1]. 
 
 
d. Initialize the error function array: 
 
 
errarray[0] = radius – radDist. 
 
STEP 16: Repeat steps 13 - 14 to improve solution for intx[1]

See figure B-14 for an illustration of the variable names. 
 
STEP 1: 
Use Algorithm 4.1 to locate the intersection point of the given 
 
geodesics.  The first geodesic has azimuth crs12 at pt1, while the second 
 
geodesic has azimuth crs3 at pt3.  Denote their intersection point by 
 
pt2. 
 
STEP 2:

vertexAngle=signedAzimuthDifference crs21,crs23  
 
STEP 7: 
If abs(sin(vertexAngle)) < tol, then either there is no turn or the 
turn is 180 degrees.  In either case, no tangent arc can be found. 
 
 
a. Return empty array.

Algorithm Steps. 
 
See figure B-15 for an illustration of the variable names. 
 
STEP 1: 
Use the geodesic intersection algorithm (Algorithm 4.1) to find a first 
 
approximation to the point where the given geodesic and locus intersect.  
 
Use the start and end coordinates of the locus along with the start and end 
 
coordinates of given geodesic as inputs to the geodesic intersection 
 
algorithm.  This will erroneously treat the locus as a geodesic; however, 
 
the calculated intersection will be close to the desired intersection.  The 
 
geodesic intersection algorithm will return the approximate intersection 
 
point, pt1, along with the courses and distances from the pt1 to the start 
 
points of the locus and given geodesic.  Denote these courses and 
 
distances as crs31, dist13, crs32, dist23, respectively. 
 
STEP 2: 
If pt1 is not found, then the locus and geodesic to not intersect. 
 
 
a. Return empty point. 
 
STEP 3: 
End if 
 
STEP 4: 
Use the inverse algorithm to calculate the course from geoSt to geoEnd.  
 
Denote this value as fcrs.  This value is needed by the direct algorithm to 
 
locate new points on the given geodesic.  
 
STEP 5: 
Use the inverse algorithm to calculate the distance and course from pt1 to 
geoSt.  Denote these values as distBase and crsBase, respectively.  
 
STEP 6: 
Obtain the forward course of the locus's defining geodesic. This course is 
stored as loc.geoAz. Denote this course as tcrs.  This value is needed 
to project the approximate point onto the defining geodesic in order to 
calculate the appropriate locus distance. 
 
STEP 7: 
Use Algorithm 5.1 to project pt1 onto the locus’s defining geodesic.  Use 
 
pt1, loc.geoStart, and tcrs as inputs.  Denote the returned point as

pInt, the returned course as crsFromPt, and the returned distance as 
 
distFromPt. 
 
STEP 8: 
Use Algorithm 3.9 to calculate the distance from the defining geodesic 
 
to the locus at pInt.  Denote this value as distLoc.  Note that distLoc 
 
may be positive or negative, depending on which side of defining geodesic 
 
the locus lays. 
 
STEP 9: 
Calculate the distance from pt1 to the locus.  This is the initial error:  
 
errarray[1] = distFromPt – abs(distLoc). 
 
STEP 10: Save the initial distance from geoSt to the approximate point: 
 
geodarray[1] = distBase.  We will iterate to improve the 
 
approximation by finding a new value for distBase that makes 
 
errarray zero. 
 
STEP 11: Calculate a new value of distBase that will move pt1 closer to the 
locus.  This is done by approximating the region where the given geodesic 
and locus intersect as a right Euclidean triangle and estimating the distance 
from the current pt1 position to the locus (see figure B-16). 
 
 
a. Calculate the angle between the geodesic from pt1 to pInt and the 
 
 
geodesic from pt1 to geoSt: 
 
theta=abs(signedAzimuthDifference(crsFrompt,crsBase)) 
 
 
b. Calculate a new value for distBase:  
 
   newdistbase=distbase-errarray[1]/cos(theta) 
  
STEP 12: Initialize the iteration count:  k = 0. 
 
STEP 13: Do while (abs(errarray[1] > tol) and 
(k < maxIterationCount) ) 
 
 
a. Use geoSt, fcrs, and newDistBase in the direct algorithm to 
update the value of pt1.  
 
 
b. Save the current values of errarray and geodarray: 
 
 
errarray[0] = errarray[1] 
 
 
geodarray[0] = geodarray[1]  
 
 
c. Set geodarray[1] = newDistBase.

4.6 
Intersections of Arc and Locus. 
 
This algorithm solves for the intersection of a fixed radius arc and a locus.  It is very 
similar to Algorithm 4.3, which computes the intersections of an arc and a geodesic.  It 
begins by treating the locus as a geodesic and applying Algorithm 4.3 to find 
approximate intersection points.  The approximation is improved by traveling along the 
locus, measuring the distance to the arc center at each point.  The difference between 
this distance and the given arc radius is the error.  The error is modeled as a series of 
linear functions of position on the locus.  The root of each function gives the next 
approximation to the intersection.  Iteration stops when the error is less than the 
specified tolerance.

STEP 1:

STEP 2: 
Use the inverse algorithm to compute the course from loc.locusStart 
 
to loc.locusEnd. Denote this value as fcrs. 
 
STEP 3:     Use Algorithm 5.2 to project the center of the arc to the locus. Denote the  
projected point as locpt. Denote the distance and course from center to 
locpt as distFromPoint and crsFromPoint, respectively. If 
locpt is on or within the radius of the arc, then it will be used to find the 
intersection(s) of the locus and the arc, intx.   
 
STEP 4: 
If (distFromPoint > radius), then no approximate intersections  
 
were found.  Return NULL. 
 
STEP 5: 
End if. 
 
STEP 6: 
Else if distFromPoint is equal to radius within tolerance level, then: 
 
a. Locus is tangent to arc. One intersection exists. 
 
b. intx[0]=locpt 
 
STEP 7: 
End if. 
 
STEP 8: 
Otherwise, distFromPoint must be less than radius, meaning there 
are two possible intersections. These two approximate intersections are 
found using spherical trigonometry and the direct algorithm. Denote the 
approximate intersections as intx[0] and intx[1]. 
 
STEP 9:

Algorithm Steps. 
 
See figure B-18 for an illustration of the variables and calculation steps. 
 
STEP 1: 
Use the inverse algorithm to calculate the course of the geodesic 
approximation to loc1.  Use loc1.locusStart and 
loc1.locusEnd as start and end points.  Denote this course as crs1. 
 
STEP 2: 
Use the inverse algorithm to calculate the course of the geodesic 
approximation to loc2.  Use loc2.locusStart and 
loc2.locusEnd  as start and end points.  Denote this course as crs2. 
 
STEP 3: 
Use loc1.locusStart, crs1, loc2.locusStart, and crs2 as 
 
input to Algorithm 4.1 to calculate an approximate solution to the locus 
 
intersection.  Denote the approximate intersection point at p1. 
 
STEP 4: 
If (p1 = NULL), then the loci do not intersect, so return NULL. 
 
STEP 5: 
Use the inverse algorithm to calculate the course of loc1’s defining 
 
geodesic.  Use loc1.geoStart and loc1.geoEnd as the start and end 
 
points, and denote the course as tcrs1. 
 
STEP 6: 
Project p1 to the geodesic of loc1 using Algorithm 5.1 with 
 
loc1.geoStart and tcrs1 as input parameters.  Store the projected 
 
point as pint1. 
 
STEP 7: 
If (pint1 = NULL), then no projected point was found so return NULL. 
 
STEP 8: 
Use the inverse algorithm to calculate distbase, the distance from 
 
loc1.geoStart to pint1. 
 
STEP 9: 
Initialize iteration counter: k = 0 
 
STEP 10: Do while (k = 0) or ( (k < maxIterationCount) and (abs(error) 
> tol) ) 
 
 
a. If (k > 0) then apply direct algorithm to project new pint1 on loc1.  
 
 
Use starting point loc1.geoStart, course tcrs1, and distance  
 
 
distbase.

Appendix B 
 
 
b. Use Algorithm 3.10 to project a point on loc1 from the current pint1.  
 
 
Denote the projected point as ploc1. 
 
 
c. Project ploc1 to the geodesic of loc2 using Algorithm 5.1 with  
 
 
loc2.geoStart and tcrs2 as input parameters.  Store the projected 
 
 
point as pint2. 
 
 
d. Use Algorithm 3.10 to project a point on loc2 from pint2.  Denote  
 
 
the projected point as ploc2.  If ploc1 were truly at the intersection 
 
 
of the loci, then ploc2 and ploc1 would be the same point.  The  
 
 
distance between them measures the error at this calculation step. 
 
 
e. Compute the error by using the inverse algorithm to calculate the  
 
 
distance between ploc1 and ploc2. 
 
 
f. Update the error and distance arrays and store the current values: 
 
 
errarray[0]  = errarray[1]  
 
 
errarray[1]  = error 
 
 
distarray[0] = distarray[1] 
 
 
distarray[1] = distbase 
 
 
g. If (k = 0), then project ploc2 onto loc1 to get a new estimate of  
 
 
distbase: 
 
 
 
(1) Project ploc2 to the geodesic of loc1 using Algorithm 5.1 with  
 
 
 
loc1.geoStart and tcrs1 as input parameters.  Store the  
 
 
 
projected point as pint1. 
 
 
 
 
(2) Use the inverse algorithm to calculate distbase, the distance from 
 
 
 
loc1.geoStart to pint1. 
 
 
h. Else  
 
 
 
(1) Use a linear root finder with distarray and errarray to find 
the  distance value that makes the error zero.  Update distbase 
with this root value.  This is possible only after the first update step 
because two values are required in each array. 
 
 
i. End if 
 
 
j. Increment iteration count: k = k + 1 
 
STEP 11: End while

STEP 12: Use Algorithm 3.11 with inputs of loc1 and ploc1 to determine if 
 
ploc1 lies on the loc1.  Then use Algorithm 3.11 with inputs of loc2 
 
and ploc1 to determine if ploc1 lies on the loc2.  If ploc1 does not lie 
 
on both loci, return NULL.

STEP 2: 
Use inverse algorithm to calculate gcrs1 and geoLen1, the course and 
 
distance from loc1.geoStart to loc1.geoEnd.

loc2.locusEnd, crs32, and radius as input parameter.  Denote the 
 
array of points returned as intx. intx[0] will be the approximate arc 
 
center point, intx[1]  will be the tangent point near loc1, and intx[2] 
 
will be the tangent point near loc2.  Also returned will be the direction of 
 
the arc, dir.

Algorithm Steps. 
 
This algorithm treats the geodesic as unbounded, so that projected points that lie 
“behind” the geodesic starting point pt1 will be returned.  If it is desired to limit 
solutions to those that lie along the forward direction of the given geodesic, then step 
4g may be modified to return a NULL solution (see figure B-21). 
 
STEP 1: 
Use the inverse algorithm to calculate the distance, azimuth, and reverse 
azimuth from pt1 to pt3.  Denote these values as crs13, crs31, and 
dist13, respectively. 
B-63 
03/10/2009

Appendix B 
STEP 2: 
Calculate the angle between the given geodesic and the geodesic between 
 
pt1 and pt3.  This is accomplished using signedAzimuthDifference 
 
function (see Algorithm 6.2) 
 
angle=abs(signedAzimuthDifference(crs13, crs12)) 
 
STEP 3: 
If (dist13 <= tol), then pt2 is the same point as pt1.  
 
STEP 4: 
If π/2-angle < tol, then the projected point pt2 is very close to or 
behind pt1 (the start of the geodesic), so extend the geodesic backward far 
enough to catch the projection. Use a spherical triangle approximation to 
calculate the needed extension distance.

b. a=dist13/sphereRad 
 
c. b=asin(sin(B)sin(a)) 
 
d. dist12=2*sphereRad*atan(tan(0.5*

e. If abs(dist12) < tol, then the projected point is identical to pt1  
 
to within the required accuracy. 
 
 
(1) crsFromPoint = crs31; 
 
 
(2) distFromPoint = dist13; 
 
 
(3) Return pt2 = pt1 
 
f. End if. 
 
g. Use the direct algorithm to move pt1 along reverse geodesic course. 
 
      Use 1.1*dist12 for the distance, crs12+π for the azimuth, and  
 
      then store the new location in the temporary variable newPt1. A 
 
      distance greater than dist12 is used to compensate for possible errors 
 
      in the spherical approximation. 
 
 
h. Use the inverse algorithm to calculate the azimuth from newPt to pt1. 
 
 
This value replaces the original azimuth value crs12. 
 
 
 
(1) Rename newPt1 as pt1: pt1 = newPt1.

Appendix B 
STEP 5: 
Calculate the approximate distance from pt1 to the projected point using 
the spherical triangle formula from steps 4(a) through 4(d). Denote the 
approximate distance found as dist13. 
 
STEP 6: 
Use the direct algorithm to project a point on the given geodesic distance 
dist13 from pt1.  Use pt1 for the starting point, dist12 for distance, 
and crs12 for azimuth.  Denote the computed point by pt2. 
 
STEP 7: 
Use the inverse algorithm to calculate the azimuth crs21 from pt2 to 
pt1. 
 
STEP 8: 
Use the inverse algorithm to calculate the azimuth crs23 and distance 
dist23 from pt3 to pt2 
 
STEP 9: 
Calculate the angle between the geodesics that intersect at pt3, and cast 
that angle into the range [0, π] using the following formula (see 
Algorithm 5.1): 
 
 
 angle=abs(signedAzimuthDifference(crs21, crs23)) 
 
STEP 10: Calculate the error and store it as the first element in the error function 
array:  errarray[0] = angle - π/2 
 
STEP 11: Store the current distance from pt1 to pt2 in the distance function array:  
distarray[0] = dist12 
 
STEP 12: A second distance/error value must be calculated before linear interpolation 
may be used to improve the solution.  The following formula may be used: 
 
 
distarray[1]=distarray[0]+errarray[0]*dist23 
 
STEP 13: Use the direct algorithm to project point on the given geodesic distance 
distarray[1] from pt1.  Use pt1 for the starting point, 
distarray[1] for distance, and crs12 for azimuth.  Denote the 
computed point by pt2. 
 
STEP 14: Use the inverse algorithm to calculate the azimuth crs21 from pt2 to 
pt1. 
 
STEP 15: Use the inverse algorithm to calculate the azimuth crs23 from pt2 to

distarray.  This gives an improved approximation to dist12. 
 
b. Use the direct algorithm to project point on the given geodesic distance 
dist12 from pt1.  Use pt1 for the starting point, dist12 for 
distance, and crs12 for azimuth.  Denote the computed point by pt2. 
 
c. Use the inverse algorithm to calculate the azimuth crs21 from pt2 to 
pt1. 
 
d. Use the inverse algorithm to calculate the distance dist23, azimuth 
crs32, and reverse azimuth crs23 from pt3 to pt2. 
 
e. Update distarray and errarray with the new values: 
distarray[0] = distarray[1] 
errarray[0] = errarray[1] 
distarray[1] = dist13

See figure B-23 for an illustration of the variables.  
 
STEP 1: 
Define the course and distance from loc.geoStart to loc.geoEnd as 
gcrs and gdist, respectively. This course and distance is a part of the locus 
structure. 
 
 
a. gcrs=loc.geoAz 
 
 
b. gdist=loc.geoLength 
 
STEP 2: 
If (abs(loc.startDist-loc.endDist) < tol), then the locus is 
 
"parallel" to its defining geodesic.  In this case, the projected point on the 
 
locus will lie on the geodesic joining pt2 with its projection on the defining 
 
geodesic, and the calculation is simplified: 
 
 
a. Apply Algorithm 5.1 to project pt2 onto the defining geodesic of loc.

Algorithm Steps. 
 
This algorithm treats the arc as a complete circle, so either zero or two tangent points 
will be returned.  If the arc is bounded and two tangent points are found, then each 
point must be tested using Algorithm 3.7 to determine whether they lie within the arc’s 
bounds. (See figure B-24) 
 
STEP 1: 
Use the inverse algorithm to calculate the distance, azimuth, and reverse 
 
azimuth from point to center.  Denote these values by crsToCenter, 
 
crsFromCenter, and distToCenter, respectively. 
 
STEP 2: 
If abs(distToCenter – radius) < tol, then point lies on the arc 
 
and is a tangent point.  
 
 
a. Set n = 1 
 
 
b. Return tanPt = point 
 
STEP 3: 
Else, if distToCenter < radius, then point lies inside of the arc and 
 
no tangent points exist. 
 
 
a. Return no solution. 
 
STEP 4: 
End if 
 
STEP 5: 
There must be two tangent points on the circle, so set n = 2

STEP 1: 
Use the inverse algorithm to calculate the distance, azimuth, and reverse 
 
azimuth from lineStart to center.  Denote these values as 
 
distStartToCenter, crsStartToCenter, and

STEP 3: 
If abs(distStartToCenter*(crsStartToCenter-crs)) < 
 
tol, then center lies on the given geodesic, which is a diameter of the 
 
circle.  In this case, the tangent points and project points are the same. 
 
 
a. Use the direct algorithm to compute tanPts[0].  Use lineStart 
as the  starting point, crs as the azimuth, and 
distStartToCenter-radius as the distance. 
 
 
b. Use the direct algorithm to compute tanPts[0].  Use lineStart as 
 
 
the  starting point, crs as the azimuth, and

STEP 9:

a. Use the direct algorithm to compute linePts[0].  Use perpPt as  
 
 
the  starting point, delta as the distance, and crs21+π as the azimuth. 
 
 
b. Use the inverse algorithm to calculate the course from linePts[0] to  
 
 
perpPt.  Denote this value by strCrs. 
 
 
c. Calculate the azimuth, perpCrs, from linePts[0] to the desired  
 
 
position of tanPts[0].  The azimuth depends upon which side of the  
 
 
line the circle lies, which is given by the sign of angle1: 
 
(1) If the circle lies to the right of the line: 
perpCrs = strCrs + π/2 
 
(2) If the circle lies to the left of the line: 
 perpCrs = strCrs - π/2 
 
 
d. Use Algorithm 5.1 to project center onto the geodesic passing through

STEP 11: Repeat steps 7-10 to solve for linePts[1] and tanPts[1].  In each 
 
iteration; however, use crs21 for azimuth in step a).  Note that using the 
 
final delta value for the first iteration in the search for linePts[1] will 
 
make the code more efficient (i.e., don’t repeat step 7). 
 
STEP 12: Return linePts[0], linePts[1], tanPts[0], and 
tanPts[1].

Calculate Angular Arc Extent. 
 
 
When calculating the angle subtended by an arc, one must take into account the 
 
possibility that the arc crosses the northern branch cut, where 0° = 360°.  The following 
 
algorithm accounts for this case. 
 
 
Input/Output.

orientation, double tol) returns a double precision value containing the arc’s  
subtended angle, where the input values are:

= 
Azimuth from center to end point of arc

Integer that indicates the direction in which the arc is

Signed Azimuth Difference.

The mod function in the definition of signedAzimuthDifference must always 
return a non-negative value.  Note that the C language’s built in fmod function does not 
have this behavior, so a replacement must be supplied.  The following code suffices: 
 
double mod(double a, double b) { 
a = fmod(a,b); 
  if (a < 0.0) a = a + b; 
return a;  }

Approximate Fixed Radius Arc Length. 
Algorithm 3.8 describes a method for computing the length of an arc to high precision.  
The following algorithm provides a solution accurate to 1 centimeter for an arc whose 
radius is less than about 300 nautical miles (NM).  This algorithm approximates the 
ellipsoid at the center of the arc in question with a “best fit” sphere, whose radius is 
computed as the geometric mean of the meridional and prime-vertical curvatures at the 
arc’s center.  
 
Given the arc center’s latitude θ , the ellipsoidal semi-major axis a  and flattening f , 
compute the local radius of curvature R  as follows:

Appendix C. Administrative Information 
 
1. Distribution. This order is distributed in Washington headquarters to the branch level in the 
Offices of Airport Safety and Standards and Communications, Navigation, and Surveillance 
Systems; Air Traffic Organization (Safety, En Route and Oceanic Services, Terminal Services, 
System Operations Services, and Technical Operations Services), and Flight Standards Services; 
to the National Flight Procedures Office and the Regulatory Standards Division at the Mike 
Monroney Aeronautical Center; to branch level in the regional Flight Standards and Airports 
Divisions; special mailing list ZVS-827, and to Special Military and Public Addressees. 
2. Background. The analysis of Global Positioning System/Wide Area Augmentation System 
(GPS/WAAS) navigation flight test data provides the basis for these criteria. A significant 
difference exists between approach procedures to runways and approach procedures to heliports. 
Approaches to runways terminate in relatively obstacle-free environments. Approaches to 
heliports commonly terminate in areas of dense population and large buildings. Speed limitations 
incorporated in these criteria provide the smallest obstacle clearance areas, the shortest segment 
lengths, and the lowest ceiling and visibility minimums. The graphic illustrations in this order are 
not to scale. The guidance published in this directive supersedes previous guidance concerning 
helicopters published in Terminal Instrument Procedures (TERPS) Instruction Letters (TILs) and 
other correspondence. 
3. Definitions. 
a. Approach Procedure Types using RNAV (GPS). 
(1) IFR to an IFR Heliport (Public and Special). An IFR approach to a heliport that meets 
Advisory Circular (AC) 150/5390-2, Heliport Design, standards for an IFR heliport. 
(2) IVH (Proceed Visually) (Special). An IFR approach to a VFR heliport that meets 
AC 150/5390-2 standards. This procedure requires flight standards approval. The phrase 
“Proceed Visually” is charted on the procedure for the visual segment from the MAP to the 
heliport. IVR applies IVH criteria to an approach to a VFR runway. 
(3) Point-in-Space (PinS) Approach (Proceed VFR) (Public and Special). An IFR PinS 
approach to one or more VFR heliports. The phrase “Proceed VFR” is charted on the procedure 
for the VFR segment following the MAP. 
(4) IFR to a Runway (Public and Special). An IFR helicopter approach procedure to a 
runway. 
b. Distance of Turn Anticipation (DTA). DTA represents the maximum distance prior to a 
fly-by-fix that a helicopter is expected to start a turn to intercept the course of the next segment. 
The along-track tolerance (ATT) value, associated with a fix, is added to the DTA value when 
DTA is applied (see figure C-1 and formula 2-6).

DTA = Radius x tan (degrees of turn  2) 
 
c. Fly-By Fix. 
 A fly-by fix is a waypoint where a turn is initiated prior to reaching it. 
d. Fly-Over Waypoint (WP). 
 A fly-over WP is a waypoint over which an aircraft is 
expected to fly before one turn is initiated. 
e. Final Approach and Takeoff Area (FATO). A defined area over which the final phase 
of the approach to a hover, or a landing, is completed and from which the takeoff is initiated. The 
guidance for a FATO is published in AC 150/5390-2. 
f. Fictitious Helipoint (FHP). The FHP is located 2,600 ft beyond the MAP and 9,023 ft in 
front of the flight path alignment point (FPAP). It is used to establish the approach course width 
for the WAAS. 
g. Flight Path Alignment Point (FPAP). The FPAP is a 3-dimensional (3D) point defined 
by World Geodetic System of 1984/North American Datum of 1983 (WGS-84/NAD-83) 
latitude, longitude, mean sea level (MSL) elevation, and WGS-84 Geoid height. The FPAP is 
used in conjunction with the FHP and the geometric center of the WGS-84 ellipsoid to define the 
final approach azimuth [localizer performance with vertical guidance (LPV) glidepath’s vertical 
plane, where used) associated with a localizer performance (LP) or LPV final course. 
h. Flight Technical Error (FTE). FTE is the measure of the pilot or autopilot’s ability to 
control an aircraft so that its indicated position matches the desired position.

Appendix C 
i. Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) Azimuth Reference Point (GARP). A 
calculated point 1,000 ft beyond the FPAP lying on an extension of a geodesic line from the 
landing threshold point/fictitious threshold point (LTP/FTP) through the FPAP. This point is 
used by the airborne system as the origin of the lateral guidance sector. It may be considered as 
the origin of an imaginary localizer antenna. 
j. Geoid Height (GH). The GH is the height of the Geoid relative to the WGS-84 ellipsoid. 
It is a positive value when the Geoid is above the WGS-84 ellipsoid and negative when it is 
below. The value is used to convert a mean sea level (MSL) elevation to an ellipsoidal or 
geodetic height - the height above ellipsoid (HAE). 
Note:  The Geoid is an imaginary surface within or around the earth that is everywhere normal to 
the direction of gravity and coincides with MSL in the oceans. It is the reference surface for 
MSL heights. 
 
k. Heliport Approach Lighting System (HALS). The HALS is a distinctive approach 
lighting configuration designed to prevent it from being mistaken for an airport runway approach 
lighting system. HALS consists of ten bars of lights at 100-ft increments and has a length of 
1,000 ft (305 m). HALS provides a visibility credit of 1/4 statute mile (SM) for nonprecision 
approaches. 
l. Height Above Landing Area Elevation (HAL). The HAL is the height of the minimum 
descent altitude (MDA) above helipoint elevation. 
m. Height Above Surface (HAS). HAS is the height of the MDA above the highest 
terrain/surface within a 5,200-ft radius of the MAP in the PinS procedure. 
n. Helipoint Crossing Height (HCH). The HCH is the height of the vertical guidance path 
above the heliport elevation at the helipoint. 
o. Helipoint. The helipoint is the aiming point for the visual segment and is normally 
centered in the touchdown and lift-off area (TLOF). The TLOF is normally centered in the 
FATO. 
p. Heliport. An area of land, water, or structure used or intended to be used for helicopter 
landings and takeoffs and includes associated buildings and facilities. IFR and VFR heliports are 
described in AC 150/5390-2. 
q. Heliport Elevation (HE). For heliports without a precision approach, the heliport 
elevation is the highest point of the FATO expressed as the distance above mean sea level 
(MSL). 
r. Heliport Reference Point (HRP). The geographic position of the helipoint, measured at 
the center of the FATO or the central point of multiple FATOs, expressed as (WGS-84/NAD-83) 
latitude and longitude to the nearest hundredth of a second. The HRP elevation is equal to the 
heliport elevation.

8260.42B CHG 1 
 
 
Appendix C 
s. Initial Departure Fix (IDF). The first fix on a PinS departure procedure where 
application of IFR obstruction protection and air traffic separation standards are provided. 
t. IFR Heliports. Facility specifications for IFR Heliports are described in chapters 6 or 7 
as appropriate of Advisory Circular 150/5390-2, Heliport Design. Chapter 6 of AC 150/5390-2 
relates to paragraph 5.3 of this order for nonprecision IFR approach procedures to IFR heliports. 
 
u. Landing and Takeoff Site. The area of intended landing and takeoff. It can be a heliport,
helistop, vertiport, or other point of landing designated for a PinS approach. 
v. Landing Threshold Point. The LTP is a 3D point at the intersection of the runway 
centerline and the runway threshold (RWT). WGS-84/NAD-83 latitude, longitude, MSL 
elevation, and geoid height define it. It is used in conjunction with the FPAP and the geometric 
center of the WGS-84 ellipsoid to define the vertical plane of an RNAV final approach course. 
w. Proceed Visually. This phrase requires the pilot to acquire and maintain visual contact 
with the FATO or elements associated with the FATO such as heliport lighting, precision 
approach path indicator (PAPI), etc. at or prior to the MAP. Obstacle and terrain avoidance from 
the MAP to the FATO is the responsibility of the pilot. A missed approach procedure is not 
provided between the MAP and the landing FATO. 
x. Proceed VFR. For PinS procedures, this phrase requires the pilot to proceed from the 
MAP to the selected landing area on the approach chart with no less than the visibility and 
ceiling required on the approach chart. For flights that do not terminate at the selected landing 
area on the approach chart, the pilot is required to proceed from the MAP under the applicable 
VFR for ceiling and visibility required by the applicable Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations 
(14 CFR) but no less than the visibility required on the approach chart, operations specifications 
(OpsSpec), or letter of agreement (LOA). The pilot is responsible for obstacle and terrain 
avoidance from the MAP to the landing site. A missed approach procedure is not provided 
between the MAP and the landing site. The landing site is not required to be in sight from the 
MAP. 
y. Reference Datum Point (RDP). The RDP is a 3D point defined by the LTP or FTP 
latitude/longitude position, MSL elevation, and a threshold crossing height (TCH) value. The 
RDP is in the vertical plane associated with the final approach course and is used to relate the 
glidepath angle of the final approach track to the landing runway. 
z.   Touchdown and Lift-Off Area (TLOF). A TLOF is a load bearing, generally paved 
area, normally centered in the FATO, on which the helicopter lands or takes off (see 
AC 150/5390-2). 
aa.   United States Air Force (USAF).  
bb.   United States Army (USA). 
cc.   United States Coast Guard (USCG).

Appendix C 
ee.   VFR Heliports. Standards and recommendations for VFR and IFR heliports are 
described in chapters 2 through 5 and chapter 8 of AC 150/5390-2. Paragraph 5.4 of this order 
relates to VFR heliports. 
ff.   Minimum instrument meteorological condition airspeed (Vmini). Vmini means 
instrument flight minimum speed, utilized in complying with minimum limit speed requirements 
for instrument flight. This is the certified minimum airspeed that a specific helicopter is 
approved to enter instrument meteorological flight conditions. 
gg.   Visual Segment Descent Angle (VSDA). The angle of descent in the visual segment. 
hh.   Visual Segment Descent Point (VSDP). The descent point within the visual segment of 
a helicopter instrument approach to an IFR heliport or runway. 
ii.   Visual Segment Reference Line (VSRL). A line perpendicular to the final course at a 
distance of 75 ft (22.9 m) from the helipoint for public use heliports and 50 ft (15.27 m) from the 
helipoint for heliports with special instrument procedures. It extends 75 ft (22.9 m) on each side 
of the final course centerline for public use heliports and 50 ft (15.27 m) on each side of the final 
course centerline for heliports with special instrument procedures. For IFR procedures the line is 
75 ft (22.9 m) from the helipoint and it extends 75 ft (22.9 m) on each side of the final approach 
course. 
jj.   Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) Localizer Performance (LP). The LP
