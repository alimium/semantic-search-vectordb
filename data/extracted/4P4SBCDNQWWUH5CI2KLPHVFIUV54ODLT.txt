Towards Control of 
Streptococcus iniae 
Justice C.F. Baiano and Andrew C. Barnes
Streptococcus iniae is an emerging zoonotic pathogen; 
such infections generally occur through injuries associated 
with preparing whole fresh ﬁ sh for cooking. Those infected 
to date have been of Asian descent, are usually elderly (av-
erage age 68 years), and have had >1 underlying condi-
tions that may predispose them to infection. Studies of the 
foundations of growth characteristics of S. iniae and its in-
teractions with piscine host cells have recently been com-
plemented by molecular studies. Advances in molecular 
biology have allowed research groups to identify numerous 
virulence factors and to explore their roles in the progres-
sion of S. iniae infection. Many of these virulence factors are 
homologous to those found in the major human pathogen S. 
pyogenes. An increased understanding of the properties of 
these factors and their effect on the success of infection is 
leading to novel approaches to control S. iniae infection; in 
particular, vaccination programs at ﬁ sh farms have reduced 
the reservoir of infection for additional clinical cases.
S
treptococcus iniae is a major ﬁ sh pathogen in many 
regions of the world. These bacteria are also zoonotic 
with infections in humans associated with the handling 
and preparation of infected ﬁ sh. The ﬁ rst human infections 
were reported in 1996 (1), and S. iniae was noted as an 
emerging zoonotic disease transmitted by food animals at 
the International Conference on Emerging Infectious Dis-
eases in 2000 (2). Human infections with S. iniae have been 
sporadic but continue to be reported with new cases arising 
in 2009 (3). Reports of these cases are likely to increase be-
cause of enhanced awareness, more reliable detection and 
identiﬁ cation methods, and the global expansion of ﬁ nﬁ sh 
aquaculture. Most cases of human S. iniae infections have 
been in persons of Asian descent, who are elderly and com-
monly have >1 underlying conditions such as diabetes mel-
Author afﬁ liation: The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Queen-
sland, Australia
litus, chronic rheumatic heart disease, cirrhosis, or other 
conditions (1,3–7).
Carrier ﬁ sh have been implicated in ﬁ sh-to-ﬁ sh trans-
mission of S. iniae (8), and these carriers may be responsi-
ble for human infection because ﬁ sh with overt signs of dis-
ease are unmarketable. Soft tissue injuries that occur during 
the preparation of fresh ﬁ sh from wet markets usually result 
in bacteremic cellulitis of the hand, followed by >1 of these 
conditions: endocarditis, meningitis, arthritis, sepsis, pneu-
monia, osteomyelitis, and toxic shock (7). Infections are 
treated with a course of antimicrobial drugs such as peni-
cillin, ampicillin, amoxicillin, cloxacillin, cefazolin, and/or 
gentamicin, doxycycline, and trimethoprim/sulfamethox-
azole over a period of 1 to several weeks, depending on the 
nature of the infection (3–5,9). S. iniae is not currently as-
signed to any Lanceﬁ eld group and is β-hemolytic on blood 
agar, with some clinical strains isolated from Asia being 
more mucoid than others (6).
Underreporting of human cases is likely because iden-
tiﬁ cation of S. iniae is based on biochemical testing of iso-
lates with commercial kits; the use of kits is associated with 
problems because S. iniae is not listed in commercial or 
clinical databases, and many atypical strains are assigned 
low matches (1,4). According to the Australian Institute of 
Health and Welfare (www.aihw.gov.au), between 1999–
2000 and 2006–2007, a total of 2,824 cases of “other” or 
“unspeciﬁ ed” streptococcal sepsis required hospitalization 
in Australia that were attributed to nongroup A, B, or C 
streptococci, or S. pneumoniae, and 2,026 cases were in 
persons >50 years of age. During the same period, the trend 
in the number of cases per year attributable to other or un-
speciﬁ ed streptococci has been upward, rising from a total 
of 278 cases in 1999–2000 to 430 in 2006–2007 (155% 
increase). In the >50 years age group, this upward trend is 
more pronounced, with a 168% increase in cases requiring 
hospitalization. It is therefore probable that some cases of 
S. iniae infection in Australia in the at-risk age group have

SYNOPSIS
pathogenic strains were more resistant to oxidative burst 
activity in macrophages (14).
The mode of invasion of S. iniae was studied in skin 
epithelial cell monolayers of rainbow trout viewed under 
polarized light (15). S. iniae adhered to, then invaded epi-
thelial cells, but its persistence and replication inside the 
cells was short-lived. However, transcytosis from epithe-
lial cells occurred within 30 minutes of contact without 
damaging the cells or cellular junctions (15). Once the 
epithelial cell layer had been breached, dissemination 
throughout the ﬁ sh through internalization in macrophag-
es can occur. By inducing macrophage death, this process 
is one of the most efﬁ cient ways of transporting the infec-
tion into the brain (15,16).
Recent molecular research into factors that contribute 
to the virulence of  S. iniae has identiﬁ ed several candi-
dates, including surface proteins, capsular polysaccharides, 
and extracellular secreted products (Figure). Moreover, the 
recent sequencing of the complete genome of S. iniae will 
accelerate the discovery of additional virulence factors and 
lead to identiﬁ cation of targets for effective vaccines for 
farmed ﬁ sh, thus reducing the potential for zoonotic infec-
tion. In light of the recent rapid increase in our knowledge 
of this emerging pathogen, we will present a synopsis of 
the processes involved in infection that have been eluci-
dated to date.
Virulence Factors 
been misidentiﬁ ed. Misidentiﬁ cation of S. iniae infection 
is likely to be the main reason for low levels of detection 
because most cases of this emerging pathogen are detected 
during retrospective studies speciﬁ cally targeting S. iniae. 
This ﬁ nding is likely to be the case in countries around the 
world that have reported outbreaks in ﬁ sh farms, but no 
human cases to date. Molecular-based detection and iden-
tiﬁ cation methods have recently been developed (informa-
tion on this aspect of identiﬁ cation can be found in a recent 
review by Agnew and Barnes) and these will lead to im-
proved reporting in future years (10).
Observations on the epidemiology and pathogenesis 
of S. iniae infections are still ongoing; however, valuable 
information on the differentiation of strains (as being ei-
ther commensal or pathogenic) has beneﬁ tted research. 
Because of the lack of potential virulence factors or phe-
notypic differences between commensal and pathogenic 
strains, pulsed-ﬁ eld gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis 
showed that differences existed between human clinical 
isolates and those from ﬁ sh surfaces (1). The human clinical 
isolates showed little variation between one another, while 
considerable differences were found between the 2 Ameri-
can Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA) dolphin 
strains and 32 other ﬁ sh isolates. It was determined that 
some unknown factors important to pathogenicity were not 
present in all strains (1). Little variation has also been found 
between clinical strains from the United States and Canada, 
although 1 strain from Pennsylvania had a PFGE pattern 
similar to the type strain (11), and 2 clinical isolates from 
Hong Kong were unrelated to a strain from Canada (4). In a 
PFGE study of isolates from Australia, similarities between 
ﬁ sh pathogenic isolates and human clinical isolates from 
North America, in addition to multiple genotypes between 
and within different ﬁ sh farms, were reported (12). Another 
PFGE study of strains from a variety of species of diseased 
ﬁ sh in the People’s Republic of China found that there were 
17 genotypes from 27 strains clustering into 5 major groups 
(13). As with the study from Australia, multiple genotypes 
were found between and within different farms.
Clinical isolates from the United States were able to 
multiply by 2 to 5 generations in 3 hours in fresh human 
blood; however, 2 isolates from Canada were able to sur-
vive, but not multiply, in human blood (11). Resistance to 
phagocytic killing in whole blood by pathogenic strains of 
S. iniae contrasted with isolates identiﬁ ed as commensal 
strains that were susceptible (9). The pathogenic strain 9117 
(a human clinical isolate causing cellulitis) caused weight 
loss in experimentally infected mice and was highly cellu-
lytic to human brain microvessel endothelial cell (BMEC) 
monolayers and invasive of Hep-2 cells. However, adher-
ence to, and invasion of, BMEC cells by strain 9117 was 
lower than that for commensal strain 9066 (obtained in a 
swab sample from a healthy ﬁ sh) (9). In a similar study, 
SiM Protein
M proteins are one of the major virulence factors in 
group A streptococci (S. pyogenes; GAS). The high level of 
diversity of emm gene types (a hypervariable gene encod-
ing the M protein) has contributed to the success of GAS in 
causing infections in humans. The M-like protein from S. 
iniae, SiM, is also a prime candidate in virulence (17,18). 
The SiM protein is a coiled-coil protein that has a molecu-
lar mass of ≈53 kDa, although 2 other variants, one with a 
1-aa insertion between the coils and another with a much 
larger mass of ≈59 kDa, have also been described (17). An 
additional variant had a natural frameshift/premature termi-
nation of the SiMA1 type in a strain from an infected tilapia 
(18). All SiM proteins possess the classical gram-positive 
membrane anchor motif LPXTG, and although they have 
several repeat motifs in the coil regions, they are not in tan-
dem as in M proteins from other species. In common with 
M proteins from S. pyogenes, S. equi, and S. dysgalactiae, 
SiM protein is a surface protein that binds human ﬁ brino-
gen to protect the bacterium from phagocytic activity (17). 
SiM proteins may also bind trout immunoglobulin by the 
Fc region (19). An allelic exchange study showed that SiM 
protein is a major virulence factor of S. iniae, contributes to 
adherence to ﬁ sh epithelial cells (18), and also conﬁ rmed

Control of S. iniae 
S. iniae (18). In S. iniae, C5a peptidase is a 123-kDa pro-
tein, encoded by scpI, with similar structural features and 
conserved residue positions to the GAS counterpart (18). 
C5a peptidase may have arisen in S. iniae by horizontal 
gene transfer, given its close proximity to a transposase and 
similar genetic organization found in GAS (18). Notably, 
allelic exchange has shown that this protein by itself is not 
required for virulence in ﬁ sh and its role in pathogenesis is 
likely a minor one (18).
Interleukin-8 Protease
Interleukin-8 ( IL-8) is produced in the host in response 
to stimuli such as lipopolysaccharides, viruses, and other 
cytokines. IL-8 protease is a cell envelope protease that is 
able to degrade the chemokine IL-8 and results in increased 
neutrophil resistance and disease dissemination (20). It is 
encoded by the cepI gene, resulting in a 1,631-aa protein 
with a C-terminal LPXTG gram-positive anchor motif and 
is homologous to the cepA gene in GAS (20).
Figure. Virulence factors of Streptococcus iniae. A diagrammatic 
representation of a cell of S. iniae showing the regulatory genes 
involved in virulence factor expression (inside cell) and the 
virulence factors on the outside of the cell. In a clockwise direction, 
SiM protein (simA) expression is likely to be regulated by mgx. SiM 
protein binds immunoglobulin (Ig) and ﬁ brinogen. C5a peptidase and 
interleukin-8 (IL-8) protease degrade their respective chemokines 
to impair phagocyte signaling. Production of the cytolysin 
streptolysin S (sag; SLS) is regulated by the sivS/R system. SLS 
lyses lymphocytes (L), erythrocytes (E), and neutrophils (N). The 
CAMP factor gene, cﬁ , is also regulated by sivS/R and is known 
to bind immunoglobulin by the Fc region. Capsular polysaccharide 
(cpsA; CPS) synthesis is controlled by sivS/R and is represented 
by a haze around the cell. Exopolysaccharide (EPS) is produced 
in excess and contributes to highly viscous growth. α–enolase 
degrades ﬁ brin clots and promotes dissemination.
earlier observations that SiM contributes to macrophage 
resistance (17).
The SiM protein genes, simA and simB, are likely to 
be regulated by a multigene regulatory protein, Mgx, that is 
homologous to the Mga protein found in GAS (17). There 
are sequence elements upstream of the simA and simB genes 
that are similar to DNA binding sites described for Mga. 
The ﬁ nding of a second mga-like element (mgx2) immedi-
ately downstream of mgx in a tilapia brain abscess isolate 
may represent part of an alternative virulence strategy (18).
C5a Peptidase
C5a peptidase hydrolyses the neutrophil chemoattrac-
tant complement factor C5a (18) and thus impairs the abil-
ity of the infected host to ﬁ ght the infection. C5a peptidase 
is a surface protein with a LPXTN gram-positive anchor 
motif (18). In GAS, C5a peptidase is found in culture su-
pernatants; however, this observation has not been made for 
Streptolysin S
The ability of S. iniae to hemolyse erythrocytes and 
damage host cell membranes results from the activity of 
cytolysins (21). The cytolysin possessed by S. iniae is 
homologous to streptolysin S (SLS) from GAS (21) and 
affects erythrocytes, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and some 
tissue types in tissue culture (22), but does not have roles 
in phagocytic resistance nor epithelial cell adherence and 
invasion (23). Nine genes in the sag operon are involved in 
SLS formation; these share 73% homology with GAS SLS 
genes (21). The number of genes and their genetic order 
are identical in both microorganisms (21). The sagA gene 
encodes a peptide that is 73% identical to the sagA protein 
from GAS, and the sagB gene encodes a protein with 77% 
identity to the sagB protein from GAS, which is predicted 
to use ﬂ avin mononucleotide as a cofactor (21). The sagC-F 
genes are similar to their counterpart genes in GAS, and 
the sagG-I genes encode ATP binding cassette-type (ABC) 
transport systems (21). Other sequence features, such as in-
verted repeats between the sagA and sagB genes and after 
the sagI gene, have similarities with GAS sag operon genes 
(21). All genes in the operon are required to produce SLS 
as knockout of sagB in S. iniae caused loss of hemolytic 
activity (21). Likewise, when the S. iniae sagA gene was 
transformed into a nonhemolytic allelic mutant strain of 
GAS (NZ131 sagA∆cat), the S. iniae version of the sagA 
gene restored hemolytic activity (21,23). The cytotoxic 
properties of SLS toward ﬁ sh cells and the likely promo-
tion of cerebrovascular trauma represent a major virulence 
factor in the pathogenesis of S. iniae (23).
The sagA gene in S. iniae is regulated by a 2-compo-
nent signal transduction system called sivS/R (24). sivS/R 
regulates virulence in vivo because no deaths occurred in

SYNOPSIS
a mouse infection model when mice were infected with 
a deletion mutant of pathogenic strain 9117 (9117∆siv) 
compared with 75% deaths when mice were infected with 
the wild type strain (24). In the siv deletion mutant, sagA 
expression was decreased by 3-fold. sivS/R also regulates 
the expression of surface proteins, including a lipoprotein/
ABC transporter homologous to Spy1228, pyruvate kinase, 
and a hyaluronate-associated protein homologous to that 
from S. equi or an ABC transporter from S. agalactiae (24). 
However, the role for these proteins in a virulence setting is 
hitherto unknown in S. iniae.
CAMP Factor
The pore-forming toxin CAMP factor synergistically 
acts with sphingomylinase-producing Staphylococcus au-
reus to produce a distinct arrow-shaped area of complete 
lysis of erythrocytes on sheep blood agar (24). CAMP 
factor has also been shown to bind immunoglobulin by 
the Fc region and therefore contributes to virulence (24). 
S. iniae harbors a CAMP factor–like gene, cﬁ , (24) that 
encodes a peptide of ≈27 kDa and shares 62% identity 
with cfa from GAS that is regulated by the sivS/R sys-
tem. Knockout mutants of the sivS/R system resulted in a 
reduced lytic reaction, and real-time PCR analysis of cﬁ  
gene expression showed it was expressed at only 10% of 
wild-type levels (24).
Immunoglobulin-Binding Proteins
A putative protein G-like protein, a cell wall associ-
ated protein ﬁ rst identiﬁ ed from group G streptococci (≈70 
kDa), from S. iniae was capable of binding trout immuno-
globulin only when grown in the presence of trout serum 
(19). Proteins of ≈35 kDa, ≈70 kDa, and >100 kDa were 
found to bind trout immunoglobulin. The size of one of the 
detected bands >100 kDa is similar in size to the tetramer 
formation of SiM proteins (17); however, experimental 
evidence is needed to conﬁ rm this. CAMP factor is also 
known to bind immunoglobulin (24).
tants aggregated in broth culture with chain lengths up to 
4× longer than the wild type. Differences in buoyancy due 
to degree of encapsulation showed that the production of 
excess capsule is likely to be as detrimental to survival as 
too little capsule (27).
The capsule operon of S. iniae is ≈21 kb in size and 
consists of 21 open reading frames (28). The genes have 
homology to genes found in other streptococci such as S. 
pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. suis, and S. thermophilus (28). 
An insertion sequence, IS981, was found between cpsL 
and cpsM in strain 9117 (28). cpsY (78% identity to CpsY 
in GAS) precedes cpsA and is transcribed in the opposite 
direction and is thought to be the promoter of the capsule 
operon (as well as other virulence genes) because it has a 
high level of homology to the LysR transcriptional regu-
lators (28). A major difference was found in the operons 
from the virulent strain 9117 and commensal strain 9066 
with strain 9066 having an ≈10-kb deletion missing the 
genes cpsF-L and orf276, orf193, and orf151. In addition, 
the cpsM gene in the commensal strain 9066 was truncated 
with the ﬁ rst 154 nt being absent, which casts doubt on the 
functionality of the gene (28).
The genes cpsA-E are responsible for the length of 
the monosaccharide sugar chains and their export (29,30). 
The central region of the operon from cpsF to cpsL con-
tains several genes encoding glycosyl transferases, which 
have a role in the polymerization of the capsule chain (28). 
This region is where most mutations in the virulent strain 
9117 were found to play a role in pathogenesis (27) and 
is the same region where the deleted genes in the com-
mensal strain 9066 occurred (28). The G + C content of 
the operon genes varies widely from 22% to 40% (28). 
The cpsF-L region has a G + C content of ≈27%, which 
is lower than that found for other S. iniae sequences and 
may indicate horizontal acquisition from other members 
of the Firmicutes (28).
Mutations in cpsA in strain 9117 resulted in long chain 
formation, aggregation of cells in broth culture and high 
buoyancy characteristic of reduced encapsulation (28). The 
cpsA mutant was attenuated in both brain and heart tissues. 
A cpsY mutant was slightly less encapsulated than the wild 
type and was attenuated only in heart tissue (28).
Allelic exchange of the cpsD gene resulted in reduced 
capsule, increased chain length, a marked decrease in all 
capsular monosaccharides, and a high degree of attenua-
tion (31). cpsD encodes an autophosphorylating tyrosine 
kinase thought to be responsible for capsule polymerization 
and export (31). cpsD mutants were able to bind more ef-
fectively to host tissues, such as epithelial cells, due to loss 
of overall negative charge (31). Insertions in the cpsH and 
cpsM genes have resulted in underproduction of capsule and 
overproduction of capsule, respectively (28). In a ﬂ ounder 
isolate obtained in Japan, insertions in cpsH, cpsM, cpsI, 
Capsule
One of the most effective ways for a bacterium to avoid 
phagocytosis is by the production of capsular polysaccha-
ride (CPS), and strains with CPS are more virulent than 
their unencapsulated counterparts (25–27). The presence of 
capsule is also involved in inhibiting complement C3 de-
position (27). Miller and Neely (27) used signature tagged 
mutagenesis to identify virulence genes using a zebraﬁ sh 
(Danio rerio) model. Five attenuated mutants with unique 
insertions in polysaccharide synthesis genes with homol-
ogy to those found in S. thermophilus plus 2 additional 
clones with insertions in a homologous gene near capsule 
synthesis genes from Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron were 
found. In contrast to the wild-type strain 9117, these mu-

Control of S. iniae 
and orf276 of strain NUF631 resulted in attenuation, which 
was measured by increased chemiluminescence response 
of macrophages and loss of acidic polysaccharides (26). 
Like CAMP factor and streptolysin S, the 2-component 
system sivS/R is involved in transcriptional regulation of 
the capsular operon (32).
Conclusions
S. iniae opportunistically infects elderly persons with 
serious underlying conditions. The expression of a suite of 
virulence factors, many of them similar to those found in 
GAS, is responsible for successful entry, propagation, and 
evasion of immune defenses of the host by this bacterium. 
Another virulence factor, polysaccharide deacetylase, en-
coded by the pdi gene, has been recently described (39). 
With the global rise of aquaculture and the dependence on it 
to provide food in many areas of the world, the numbers of 
cases of S. iniae infection are likely to be much higher than 
currently reported and will increase in the future with the 
expansion of the industry. Understanding the pathogenic 
processes of S. iniae is already facilitating the development 
of vaccines for use in ﬁ sh farms and represents the most 
sustainable and effective method of reducing the incidence 
of economically devastating outbreaks and clinical presen-
tations in humans, especially in those most at risk.
Phosphoglucomutase
Also involved in capsular biosynthesis is phosphoglu-
comutase, a 571-aa protein encoded by pgmA that intercon-
verts glucose 6-phosphate and glucose 1-phosphate (33). 
Transposon mutagenesis of the promoter region upstream 
of pgmA resulted in a highly attenuated mutant that was 
more susceptible to whole blood killing (33). This suscepti-
bility was attributed to a decrease in the amount of exopoly-
saccharide capsule on the cell surface, decreased negative 
charge, and a larger cell volume 3–5× that of the wild type. 
Increased susceptibility to the pore-forming cationic antimi-
crobial peptide moronecidin was also reported, most likely 
due to changes in cell wall architecture because of  increased 
cellular volume and a decrease in cell wall rigidity (33).

Exopolysaccharide
The quantitative composition of monosaccharides 
present in exopolysaccharide (EPS) is distinct from those 
found in CPS (34). The routine vaccination of ﬁ sh in Israel 
has given rise to new strains of S. iniae responsible for mass 
ﬁ sh deaths (34). These new strains were formed when an 
autogenous vaccine strain, KFP404, was succeeded by new 
strains KFP468, KFP477, and KFP523, which were char-
acterized by a viscous broth culture similar to that observed 
with S. thermophilus used in yoghurt production (34). EPS 
production by the successor strains was 5× higher than the 
autogenous vaccine strain. Vaccination of ﬁ sh with the EPS 
extracts elicited a survival rate of 78%, which was similar 
to the 72% survival rate when whole cells were used. Thus, 
EPS appears to be antigenic and excessive production may 
have been selected by vaccination (34).

α-Enolase
The ability of S. iniae to cross tissues through plasmino-
gen activation is facilitated by α-enolase (35), which is also 
a known contributory factor to the virulence of GAS (36). 
The proteolytic activity of plasmin in dissolving ﬁ brin clots 
enables pathogens to migrate faster through extracellular 
matrices (37), and α-enolase expedites invasion through the 
host tissues (38) and, ultimately, into the circulatory system. 
The α-enolase from S. iniae (≈50 kDa) is a plasmin/plasmi-
nogen binding enzyme that is 97% similar to the α-enolases 
of S. agalactiae and GAS (35). Immunoblot using antibodies 
raised against the puriﬁ ed recombinant protein showed cell 
wall association in S. iniae; however, it does not contain the 
classical gram-positive membrane anchor.

Genomic Signatures of Inﬂ uenza A 
Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 Virus
Guang-Wu Chen and Shin-Ru Shih
Adaptive mutations that have contributed to the emer-
gence of inﬂ uenza A pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus, which 
can replicate and transmit among humans, remain unknown. 
We conducted a large-scale scanning of inﬂ uenza protein 
sequences and identiﬁ ed amino acid–conserving positions 
that are speciﬁ c to host species, called signatures. Of 47 sig-
natures that separate avian viruses from human viruses by 
their nonglycoproteins, 8 were human-like in the pandemic 
(H1N1) 2009 virus. Close examination of their amino acid 
residues in the recent ancestral swine viruses of pandemic 
(H1N1) 2009 virus showed that 7 had already transitioned 
to human-like residues and only PA 356 retained an avian-
like K; in pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus, this residue changed 
into a human-like R. Signatures that separate swine viruses 
from human viruses were also present. Continuous monitor-
ing of these signatures in nonhuman species will help with 
inﬂ uenza surveillance and with evaluation of the likelihood 
of further adaptation to humans.
A 
recent outbreak of pandemic (H1N1) 2009, previously 
known as the swine-origin inﬂ uenza A, has infected 
>296,000 persons worldwide; 3,486 deaths have been re-
ported (1). An increased number of infected humans can 
potentially alter virulence in the human population. The 
genomic sequences of many of the new strains of pandemic 
(H1N1) 2009 virus have revealed important information 
for promoting medical diagnosis, drug-resistance monitor-
ing, clinical and basic research, and vaccine development. 
Nevertheless, analyzing adaptive mutation of the new pan-
demic (H1N1) 2009 virus is a priority so that researchers 
can evaluate the likelihood that viruses from other nonhu-
man species will further adapt to humans.

Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus consists of multiple re-
assorted virus genes from different origins. Of its 8 seg-
mented genomic RNAs, 2 polymerase genes, PB2 and PA, 
were from the avian virus of North American lineage and 
were introduced into swine populations around 1998. The 
other polymerase gene, PB1, also evolved recently from a 
human seasonal inﬂ uenza (H3N2) virus around the same 
year. This particular H3N2 PB1 gene is known to have 
originated from an avian virus that entered humans in 
1968. However, hemagglutinin (HA), nucleoprotein (NP), 
and nonstructural (NS) protein genes of pandemic (H1N1) 
2009 virus descended directly from the classic swine in-
ﬂ uenza A virus of North American lineage, which can be 
traced back to the 1918 virus. Originating from the Eur-
asian swine virus, the remaining 2 genes, neuraminidase 
(NA) and matrix (M), were introduced from birds around 
1979 (2,3). Limited information is available as to how this 
unique combination of gene segments evolved from 1998 
until it was identiﬁ ed in April 2009 or on the molecular 
transitions or evolutionary path of this virus before it was 
transmitted among humans.
Our previous study developed an entropy-based com-
putational scheme to identify host-speciﬁ c genomic signa-
tures of human and avian inﬂ uenza viruses (4). This method 
is based on an entropy threshold computed from the amino 
acid composition at the well known PB2-627 position of 
avian inﬂ uenza viruses (entropy value of 0.4 was based 
on 95 avian inﬂ uenza genomes, as of early 2006), which 
contains mostly glutamic acid in the native avian hosts of 
the viruses. This threshold was then used to identify the 52 
species-associated positions at which each of the 2 viruses 
settles as a distinct amino acid residue that is characteristic 
of the host. Although the origin of the gene segments in 
pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus has been determined (2,3), 
the mechanism of transformation of the host-speciﬁ c ami-

RESEARCH
no acid signatures is unclear, because the new viral genes 
evolved after they were introduced into the swine popula-
tion some years ago.
By adopting the entropy proﬁ ling approach, this study 
attempts to update inﬂ uenza A viral signatures on the ba-
sis of all inﬂ uenza sequences from the National Center for 
Biotechnology Information (NCBI). In addition to provid-
ing an updated list of human-avian signatures, this study 
also computes the human-swine signatures and analyzes 
the amino acid sequences of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus 
at the host species–speciﬁ c positions to elucidate the adap-
tive mutation of inﬂ uenza A viruses in these host species. 
As more new inﬂ uenza virus isolates are collected and their 
sequences analyzed, the signatures at the host species–
speciﬁ c positions serve as predictors of adaptive mutation, 
subsequently providing valuable information to help in pre-
paring for potential pandemics.

2009 human outbreak. To elucidate the transition of amino 
acid residues along this evolutionary course, we collected 
and analyzed the protein sequences of 18 recent ancestral 
swine viruses of the new H1N1 viruses (hereinafter termed 
“recent ancestral swine viruses”) for 1999–2009 from 
the ancestral lineages of the new pandemic (H1N1) 2009 
strains. The sampling was based on the phylogenetic trees 
published in a study by Smith et al. (6). Although a number 
of swine virus origins have been reported, resulting in vari-
ous genetic lineages and subtypes, we are most interested in 
identifying a swine virus population from which the current 
pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus might have evolved directly. 
Not only are those 18 strains chronologically closer (after 
the years 1997–1998) to the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 viruses 
but their PB2 and PA genes are also descendants of avian 
viruses, which complies with the conclusion drawn from 
recent publications. The online Appendix Table, available 
from http://www.cdc.gov/EID/content/15/12/1897-appT.
htm, summarizes the strain names and accession numbers 
of recent ancestral swine viruses included in this study.
Entropy-based Signature Identiﬁ cation
For each amino acid position of the aligned sequences 
of the same virus type, i.e., avian, human, swine, or pan-
demic (H1N1) 2009, an entropy value was computed by 
using the formula –ΣPi × ln(Pi), as described by Chen et al. 
(4). This formula follows the deﬁ nition of Shannon entropy 
(7) that has been used to evaluate the diversity of a system. 
In this study, an entropy was used to measure the variabil-
ity of aligned amino acid residues at a given genomic posi-
tion, where i = 1 to 20 represents 20 different amino acid 
residues, and Pi represents the probability density of the 
respective residue. An entropy value ranges from 0 (only 1 
residue present at that position) to 2.996 (all 20 residues are 
equally represented). As is assumed, a position at which the 
entropy is less than or equal to a prespeciﬁ ed threshold has 
a consensus residue for that virus type. When viruses iso-
lated from 2 host species are compared, a species-speciﬁ c 
signature position is considered to have different consensus 
amino acid residue from each of the 2 viruses at the same 
position. In this study, an entropy threshold of 0.33 was 
used, based on the PB2-627 position of 3,391 avian inﬂ u-
enza sequences.
Inﬂ uenza Virus Sequences
All inﬂ uenza A virus protein sequences from the NCBI, 
as of May 28, 2009, were downloaded and analyzed. These 
full-length or partial sequences were grouped according to 
the hosts from which the viruses were isolated: humans, 
avian, and swine. In particular, to observe how these virus-
es vary in terms of residues, the newly deposited pandemic 
(H1N1) 2009 virus sequences were considered separately 
from the human isolates. For each host-speciﬁ c group, se-
quences belonging to each viral protein were aligned using 
the program ClustalW (5). Based on the proposed signature 
identiﬁ cation procedure, 2 surface proteins, HA and NA, 
were not analyzed because their extensive genetic diversity 
prevents satisfactory multiple alignment within either hu-
man or avian viruses. As an alternatively translated protein 
product from the PB1 gene, PB1-F2 is also not included in 
the analysis because it terminates prematurely at position 
12. For each of the 4 groups of data, i.e., human, avian, 
swine, and pandemic (H1N1) 2009, eight alignments were 
analyzed: PB2, PB1, PA, NP, M1, M2, NS1, and NS2. The 
total number of sequences varied from gene to gene and 
from host to host, subject to their availability at the NCBI. 
For human-isolated viruses (excluding strains of pandemic 
(H1N1) 2009 virus), >3,000 sequences of the 8 proteins 
were analyzed. For avian-isolated, swine-isolated, and 
pandemic (H1N1) 2009 viruses, the numbers of sequences 
were ≈3,500, 350, and 70, respectively.
Results
In 2006, we reported 52 avian-human signatures based 
on a small set of inﬂ uenza sequence data of 15,785 protein 
sequences. The selection was based on an entropy thresh-
old value of 0.4 set at position 627 in the PB2 gene (82 Es 
and 13 Ks from 95 avian PB2 sequences) because that po-
sition has been considered associated with host-restriction 
(8–11). Of the 52 positions, 45 are in the genes PB2, PB1, 
PA, NP, M1, M2, NS1, and NS2 examined in this work. 
Recent Ancestors of Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 Viruses
Smith et al. (6) performed evolutionary analysis of the 
early development of the pandemic, indicating that spo-
radic infection of humans with triple reassortant and other 
subsequent reassortant swine viruses occurred before the

Genomic Signatures of Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 Virus
Today, >100,000 inﬂ uenza protein sequences are available 
at NCBI, and a new entropy threshold of 0.33 was set based 
on the currently available avian sequences of PB2-627, 
which contain 3,113 Es, 228 Ks, 46 Vs, 2 As, and 2 Gs. 
This threshold was adopted to update the list of 47 avian-
human signatures in Table 1 for the 8 proteins of interest. 
Consistent with our earlier ﬁ ndings, most signatures are 
located on the NP gene (15 positions), followed in number 
by PA (10 positions), PB2 (9 positions), M2 (5 positions), 
M1 (3 positions), PB1 (2 positions), NS2 (2 positions), and 
NS1 (1 position). The 20 signatures associated with PB1, 
NP, and M1 do not differ between the 2 datasets of 2006 
and 2009. In PB2, two new signatures are identiﬁ ed at posi-
tions 567 and 702. These 2 positions were only just omitted

from the 2006 list because their entropy values (0.490 and 
0.404, respectively) exceeded the 0.4 threshold, based on 
the 95 avian sequences examined at that time. New entries 
in Table 1 also include PA-100, M2-93, and NS1-81. In 
2006, although PB2-674 was reported as a signature, it is 
disqualiﬁ ed here because the entropy of 0.3376 (3,146 As, 
88 Es, 87 Ts, 38 Ss, 13 Gs, 4 Vs, and 1 K for avian virus) 
exceeds the new 0.33 threshold at this position. Similarly, 
PA-382 (2,421 Ds, 311 Es, 2 Vs, and 1 N in human viruses, 
with an entropy of 0.3633) and NS2-70 (2,898 Ss, 352 Gs, 
28 Rs, and 1 D in avian viruses, with an entropy of 0.3483) 
were both removed from the 2006 list.
Taubenberger et al. (12) identiﬁ ed 10 polymerase gene 
positions that separate avian viruses from human inﬂ uenza 
A viruses. Table 1 shows 8 of them (PB2 199, 475, 567, 
627, and 702; PA 55, 100, and 552), suggesting that the 
method is robust in ﬁ nding these signatures. Two other 
polymerase gene positions that Taubenberger et al. also 
reported are PB1-375 and PA-382; the latter has already 
been mentioned above. The other missing position in Table 
1, PB1-375, has an entropy value of 0.8865 for human and 
0.6338 for avian viruses. This position was also excluded 
from the 2006 list because of an entropy of 0.698 from avi-
an viruses, which substantially exceeded the 0.4 threshold.
To elucidate the potential adaptive mutations of the 
pandemic (H1N1) 2009 viruses, we studied the amino acid 
sequences of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 viruses at the posi-
tions that represent the so-called species-speciﬁ c signatures 
of avian and human viruses.  As shown in to the last column 
of Table 1, 36 of the 47 positions display avian-like signa-
tures in the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus. Two positions, 
PB2-588 and NP-313, exhibit neither avian- nor human-
like signatures. Eight human-like signatures were found 
in pandemic (H1N1) 2009 strains, except for NS1-227, in 
which all new viruses have an early-terminating NS1 pro-
tein and, therefore, contain no residue.
Table 1 presents the updated avian-human signatures 
for inﬂ uenza A viruses; Table 2 summarizes the swine-
human signatures. Medical literature documents that the 
swine virus population has distinct evolutionary lineages 
that originated from the classic 1918 virus referred to as 
classic or North American swine virus, and the others of 
post-1979 Eurasian swine virus and subsequent triple reas-
sortants. Because the residue diversity at many positions 
markedly increased for these swine viruses because of 
their distinct origins, only 8 swine-human signatures met 
the 0.33 threshold. Unlike some positions in which human-
like signatures of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 were found 
(Table 1), in this study, all 8 locations of the swine-human 
signature of this new virus are characteristic of swine. No-
tably, Table 1 lists all 8 positions in Table 2, with each hav-
ing the same signature as in the avian virus. Restated, avian 
and swine viruses contain the same amino acid residue at 
the 8 human-swine signature positions.
We attempted to further elucidate the transition of the 
amino acid residue on the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus 
that have human signatures by sampling 18 recent ancestral 
swine viruses (online Appendix Table). Doing so enables 
us to examine more closely the prevalence of amino acid 
residues speciﬁ cally with pandemic (H1N1) 2009 viruses. 
Table 3 summarizes the amino acid statistics of these re-
cent ancestral swine viruses together with avian, human, 
and pandemic (H1N1) 2009 sequences at the 8 positions 
containing human residues for pandemic (H1N1) 2009 vi-
rus in Table 1. Consider PB2-271, for example, avian vi-
ruses have signature T, whereas human viruses have signa-
ture A. Although pandemic (H1N1) 2009 viruses also have 
the human signature A, their predecessors, i.e., the recent 
ancestral swine viruses, have already acquired the human 
signature A at this position. PB1-336, along with PA-409, 
NP-33, -100, -305, and -357, follows the same residue tran-
sition, all showing human-characteristic residues in both 
recent ancestral swine and pandemic (H1N1) 2009 viruses. 
PA-356 is the only exception, where the residue in recent 
ancestral swine viruses still maintains an avian-character-
istic K before changing to a human residue R in pandemic 
(H1N1) 2009 viruses. Of particular interest is whether the 
transition from K to R at position PA-356 is responsible for 
the ability of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 viruses to replicate 
and transmit efﬁ ciently in humans.
After all 8 human residue-containing positions of pan-
demic (H1N1) 2009 viruses were found to be within PB2,

†Eighteen recent ancestral swine viruses as listed in the online Appendix Table (available from www.cdc.gov/EID/content/15/12/1897-appT.htm). We 
consider recent ancestral strains phylogenetically neighboring to the pandemic 2009 strains, in particular for PB2 and PA genes they are clustered 
together with recent avian strains because the pandemic (H1N1) viruses were reported to originate from avian viruses around 1998. Note that for 1 strain, 
A/swine/Missouri/4296424/06(H2N3), the PA sequence was not found anywhere near the other 17 recent swine strains of interest. Two PB1 sequences, 
A/swine/Hong Kong/78/2003(H1N2) and A/swine/Korea/C13/2008(H5N2), were also found distantly located from the other 16 recent swine PB1 
sequences. We excluded these 3 sequences from the amino acid statistics in this table because of their genetic deviation from the remaining ancestral 
swine viruses we have collected here.
more distant from pandemic (H1N1) 2009 viruses, PB1-
216 maintains an avian-residue S in 6 of 7 viruses. Our 
results show that the position-speciﬁ c transition may serve 
as a molecular marker for monitoring such adaptive muta-
tions in the future.
Discussion
Although most studies confer that the death rate as-
sociated with pandemic (H1N1) 2009 infection is more 
moderate than that of subtype H5N1 infection, its virulence 
may vary with adaptive mutations in viral genes, subse-
quently increasing the likelihood that the new virus alters 
its virulence in the new host species. Many of the previous-
ly identiﬁ ed virulence factors are apparently not involved. 
For instance, no E to K mutation at position 627 of PB2 is 
observed, which has been considered an important factor 
for avian virus to efﬁ ciently replicate in mammalian sys-
tems (8–11). Previous studies have indicated that PB1-F2 
contributes viral pathogenesis in the mammalian system 
(13,14). No PB1-F2, however, is predicted in pandemic 
(H1N1) 2009 viruses because it terminates prematurely at 
position 12. Its NS1 protein is truncated at position 220 and, 
PB1, PA, and NP protein genes, all amino acid positions 
of these 4 proteins were scanned for their residue transi-
tions among the 4 virus populations shown in Table 3. The 
change in the amino acid that may be associated with the 
transformation of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus is sum-
marized in Table 4. As well as PA-356, already shown in 
Table 2, two additional positions, PB2-684 and PA-204, 
showed the same dominant amino acid residue in avian 
and recent ancestral swine viruses, but a different domi-
nant residue in pandemic (H1N1) 2009 viruses and human 
viruses. Dominance is deﬁ ned here as 1 residue containing 
the largest sequence count compared with other residues at 
a particular aligned position. The previously used entropy 
measurement in Tables 1, 2, and 3 does not apply to the 
positions listed in Table 4, in which we emphasize the ami-
no acid transition of dominant residues instead of highly 
conserved ones subject to the prescribed entropy threshold 
0.33. Other than those 3 positions, PB1-216 was found to 
contain a human residue G in 8 of 9 recent ancestral swine 
viruses that are closer to pandemic (H1N1) 2009 viruses 
in the phylogenetic tree published in a study by Smith et 
al. (6). However, for the other 7 recent ancestors that are

therefore, lacks a PDZ ligand interacting domain. As sug-
gested recently, the presence of this PDZ ligand domain in-
creases the pathogenicity of avian inﬂ uenza A viruses (15). 
Regardless of whether these known factors are missed, a 
previous study has demonstrated that the virulence of pan-
demic (H1N1) 2009 virus is higher than that of seasonal 
inﬂ uenza A viruses (16). Although a virulence marker and 
a host range factor may not be necessarily linked tightly, 
recent investigations have also demonstrated that altering 
PB2-627 from E to K in the avian viruses increases its viru-
lence in the mammalian experimental system (9–11). For 
example, avian inﬂ uenza virus subtype H7N7 reportedly 
infects humans (17). A human isolate from a fatal case had 
its PB2-627 changed from avian-characteristic E to K. Cor-
respondingly, the species-associated signatures identiﬁ ed 
in this study may serve as potential molecular targets for 
further evaluating how they impact the virulence of pan-
demic (H1N1) 2009 viruses in humans.
As shown in Tables 1 and 2, the number of signature 
positions decreases signiﬁ cantly from 47 (human vs. avian) 
to 8 (human vs. swine), and the positions of the latter are 
a subset of those of the former. These observations may 
have the following implications. First, the 3 host species of 
interest differ, with each providing a unique environment 
for infection by the inﬂ uenza virus. When the avian virus 
enters humans or swine, its genetic feature is shaped by a 
particular evolutionary path. The viruses, therefore, have 
different signatures. Second, some avian-like signatures 
are preserved in swine viruses, suggesting that both avian 
species and swine may provide similar conditions for har-
boring inﬂ uenza A viruses. The body temperature may be 
a determinant. As is generally known, many avian species 
have a body temperature exceeding 40oC; for most pigs it is 
variable but still higher than the human body temperature, 
which is 37oC. Consequently, the signatures are retained 
when an avian virus enters the swine population, with simi-
lar signature-related viral replication mechanisms in both 
species. Third, the 39 signature positions shown in Table 
1, but absent from Table 2, may be correlated with certain 
functional domains that interact with host factors unique in 
humans while differing signiﬁ cantly from those of avian 
and swine. Finally, the number of signature positions of 
swine versus humans is substantially lower than those of 
avian versus humans, suggesting that the species barrier to 
humans is easier for a swine virus to cross than for an avian 
virus.
The entropy-based computation depends strongly on a 
good multiple sequence alignment. The 2 surface proteins 
HA and NA are excluded from this analysis because both 
contain sequences that diverged sufﬁ ciently from so many 
subtypes of a given species. Locating conserved residues at 
particular positions on the basis of these alignments is ex-
tremely difﬁ cult. The entropy threshold is the other param-
eter requiring attention to locate a signature position. In this 
study, the entropy determined from PB2-627 of the aligned 
residues of all avian viruses is used because PB2-627 is the 
most laboratory-proved host-restriction marker (8–11). A 
complete new set of signatures can be reproduced rapidly 
by using a different entropy threshold based on other fac-
tors. The diverse genetic origins of inﬂ uenza viruses would 
also have great impact on the reported signatures. The 
proposed entropy-based method to reach the 8 positions 
listed in Table 2 was based on all swine viruses of differ-
ent origins, including North American-(classic 1918) ori-
gin strains, Eurasian (post-1979 avian)-origin strains, and 
recent triple reassortants. A comparison of, for example, 
all human viruses versus classic 1918-origin swine viruses 
before 1978 (≈75 strains, or 20% of our swine sequence 
population) would report 60 signature positions (data not 
shown). In this work, we included all swine viruses of mul-
tiple origins in producing Table 2 to consider only host-spe-
ciﬁ c genomic signatures that have been shaped by the same 
swine species regardless of origin. For the same reason, we 
did not subdivide avian or human populations into lineages 
when reporting avian-human signatures in Table 1.
This study analyzed a complete collection of species-
speciﬁ c inﬂ uenza A viral sequences, including the long-
evolving avian, recent ancestral swine and human viruses, 
as well as pandemic (H1N1) 2009 viruses, which is still 
in its infancy. The amino acid sequence transition of pan-
demic (H1N1) 2009 virus at the signature positions was 
also elucidated by applying the entropy-based signature 
analysis to these sequences. They were found mostly to 
be characteristic of avian species, as presented in Table 1. 
Notably, 8 of them changed from avian-like signatures to 
human-like signatures. Close examination of the residue 
transition at these 8 positions in Table 3 showed that PA-
356, unlike the other 7 positions, retained an avian-like sig-
nature in the recent ancestral swine population and changed 
to a human-like signature only in pandemic (H1N1) 2009. 
This ﬁ nding suggests that PA-356 may be related to host-
restriction factors from swine to human species. Similarly, 
all ribonucleoprotein positions were scanned for the same 
transitioning pattern as in PA-356, i.e., a retained avian-
like residue in the recent ancestral swine population and 
a change to the human residue in pandemic (H1N1) 2009 
viruses. Table 4 lists them all. Although 1 of the positions, 
PB1- 216, was not dominated by the residue S as we would 
have expected, it exhibited a mixture of 2 residues involv-
ing a transition from avian to human viruses. In summary, 
Table 4 provides a list of candidate host-restriction factors 
that we believe are important to adaptive mutation of inﬂ u-
enza A viruses among the 3 host species. Continuous moni-
toring of these signatures in nonhuman species will help in 
inﬂ uenza surveillance and in evaluating the likelihood of 
further adaptation to humans.

Asia (1). Patients co-infected with 2 tick-borne pathogens 
usually show more severe clinical signs of longer duration 
(1). Experimental concurrent infections with A. phagocy-
tophilum and B. burgdorferi may suppress interleukin-2 
(IL-2) and interferon-γ production, promote IL-4 response, 
increase pathogen load, and intensify Lyme arthritis (2–4). 
Natural infection and co-infection with these 4 agents have 
been reported in the People’s Republic of China in vari-
ous tick species (5–7) such as I. persulcatus, Dermacentor 
silvarum, Haemaphysalis concinna, H. longicornis, and H. 
warburconi, which are known to feed on small mammals 
as well as humans.
We hypothesize that multiple agents might be pres-
ent in rodents from tick-infested areas. The purpose of this 
study was to identify A. phagocytophilum, B. burgdorferi, 
SFG rickettsiae, and F. tularensis in rodents from main-
land China and to better understand the public health role 
of these emerging and reemerging pathogens.
Materials and Methods
A total of 705 rodents from 6 provinces and autono-
mous regions of mainland People’s Republic of China were 
tested by PCRs for tick-borne agents (Anaplasma phago-
cytophilum, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, spotted fever 
group rickettsiae, and Francisella tularensis). Infection 
rates were 5.5%, 6.7%, 9.1% and 5.0%, respectively. Eigh-
teen (2.6%) rodents of 10 species were positive for 2 or 3 
agents. Sequence analysis of PCR products conﬁ rmed the 
presence and genotypes of detected agents. These ﬁ nd-
ings demonstrate that these tick-borne agents cocirculate 
and that a variety of rodent species may be involved in their 
enzootic maintenance.

naplasma phagocytophilum, Borrelia burgdorferi 
sensu lato, spotted fever group (SFG) rickettsiae, and 
Francisella tularensis are the causative agents of human 
granulocytic anaplasmosis, Lyme disease, spotted fever, 
and tularemia, respectively. These agents are naturally 
maintained in animal reservoirs and considered emerging 
or reemerging pathogens with serious public health impli-
cations. Although these agents could infect humans through 
various routes, ticks play a major role in transmission from 
animal hosts to humans.
Co-infection with these agents has been found in many 
tick species including Ixodes scapularis in northeastern 
United States, I. paciﬁ cus and I. spinipalpis in the west-
ern United States I. ricinus in Europe, and I. persulcatus in 
Sample Collection
During 2004–2006, rodents were collected at 6 study 
sites in Heilongjiang Province, Inner Mongolia Autono-
mous Region, Jilin Province, Zhejiang Province, Guizhou 
Province, and Xinjiang Autonomous Region (Figure) 
at various times according to peak seasons of tick spe-
cies. The ﬁ rst 3 sites were forested highlands in the Small 
Xing’an Mountains and the Great Xing’an Mountains of 
northeastern China, where local residents worked and were 
exposed to rodents and ticks. The study sites in Zhejiang 
and Guizhou provinces were forested rolling hills with 
typical temperate zone vegetation; these regions attract 
hundreds of thousands of tourists per year. The study site

Tick-borne Agents in Rodents, China
in Xinjiang Autonomous Region was a forest with a rural 
resident population. Rodents were trapped by using pea-
nuts as bait. After captured rodent species were identiﬁ ed, 
spleen specimens were collected and stored at –20°C until 
DNA was extracted.

where rodents were collected, 2004–2006. Numbers in parentheses 
are co-infection rates of rodents with 2 or 3 tick-borne agents
Extraction of DNA
Total DNA was extracted from spleen samples by us-
ing Trizol agent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) follow-
ing the instructions of the manufacturer. Brieﬂ y, ≈300 mg 
of spleen tissue from each rodent was crushed in Trizol 
reagent, and DNA was separated from RNA by centrifuga-
tion. DNA was precipitated after washing twice in a solu-
tion containing 0.1 M sodium citrate in 10% ethanol. The 
DNA pellet was then washed in 75% ethanol and kept at 
room temperature for 10–20 min. After centrifugation at 
2,000 × g at 2–8°C for 5 min, DNA was dissolved in 8 
mmol/L NaOH and centrifuged to remove insoluble ma-
terial. The supernatant containing DNA was removed and 
adjusted with HEPES buffer to a pH of 7–8.

Statistical Analysis
Chi-square or Fisher exact tests were used to compare 
proportions. p values <0.05 were considered statistically 
signiﬁ cant.
PCR
Nested PCR was conducted with primers designed to 
amplify part of the 16S rRNA gene of A. phagocytophi-
lum, as described (8). For ampliﬁ cation of B. burgdorferi 
DNA, a nested PCR was performed with primers derived 
from B. burgdorferi 5S–23S rRNA intergenic spacer (9). 
PCR was performed by using primers Rr 190.70p and Rr 
190–701n to amplify a fragment of the gene encoding a 
190-kDa outer membrane protein A (ompA) gene speciﬁ c 
for SFG rickettsiae (10). Samples were tested for F. tula-
rensis by a nested PCR speciﬁ c for the outer membrane 
protein (fopA) gene, as described (11). All PCRs were 
performed by using a model 2700 thermal cycler (Perkin-
Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA). PCR products were separat-
ed by agarose gel electrophoresis, stained with ethidium 
bromide, and examined under UV light. To avoid con-
tamination, we performed DNA extraction, reagent setup, 
ampliﬁ cation, and agarose gel electrophoresis in separate 
rooms and included negative controls (distilled water) 
were in each ampliﬁ cation.
Results
A total of 705 rodents were captured. The number 
of rodents tested and infectivity rates at different survey 
sites are shown in the Table. A. phagocytophilum was de-
tected only in rodents captured in eastern regions of China 
(Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Zhejiang provinces) (Figure). B. 
burgdorferi was detected in rodents captured at all 6 survey 
sites. SFG rickettsiae were detected in rodents captured at 
all sites except Jilin Province. F. tularensis was detected in 
rodents captured only in northern China (Heilongjiang and 
Jilin provinces and Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang autono-
mous regions; Figure).
In Heilongjiang Province, all 4 agents were detected in 
rodents at similar frequencies (χ2 2.80, df 3, p = 0.424). No 
SFG rickettsiae were detected in rodents from Jilin Prov-
ince. The infectivity rates for the 3 agents in Jilin Province 
did not signiﬁ cantly differ (χ2 2.23, df 2, p = 0.328). In-
fectivity rates for SFG rickettsiae were signiﬁ cantly higher 
than those for B. burgdorferi and F. tularensis in rodents 
from Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region (χ2 39.76, df 2, 
p<0.001). Infectivity rates for the 3 agents in Xinjiang Au-
tonomous Region did not differ signiﬁ cantly (χ2 5.01, df 
2, p = 0.082). Except for F. tularensis, the other 3 agents 
showed similar infectivity rates for Zhejiang Province (χ2 
1.30, df 2, p = 0.523). Only B. burgdorferi and SFG rick-
ettsiae were found in Guizhou Province, and the difference 
DNA Sequencing and Analysis
PCR products of positive samples were sequenced 
directly by using a dideoxynucleotide cycle sequencing 
method with an automated DNA sequencer (ABI PRISM 
377; Perkin-Elmer). To limit errors in sequencing, we per-
formed 2 sequencing reactions of each PCR product. When 
different sequences were obtained, additional sequencing 
reactions were conducted to generate a consensus sequence. 
Sequences obtained in the present study were compared 
with the corresponding sequences deposited in GenBank 
by using the BLAST program of the National Center for

belonged to the B. garinii genospecies, similar to agents 
detected in ticks (GenBank accession no. DQ150540) in 
northern China. Of 16 B. burgdorferi detected in Zhejiang 
Province, 12 belonged to the B. garinii genospecies and 
the other 4 belonged to the B. valaisiana–related group 
(GenBank accession nos. EU160458 and EU160459). 
The 2 strains found in Guizhou Province also belonged to 
the B. valaisiana–related group (GenBank accession no. 
EU247840).
For identiﬁ cation of SFG rickettsiae, partial nucleotide 
sequences of the ompA gene were obtained from positive 
specimens in Heilongjiang Province and Inner Mongo-
lia Autonomous Region. All sequences were identical to 
those of the R. sibirica genotype (GenBank accession no. 
U43807). Nucleotide sequences of 35 specimens positive 
for F. tularensis were identical to each other and to pub-
lished sequences for the F. tularensis subsp. holarctica 
strain (GenBank accession no. AF247642.2).
in their infectivity rates was not signiﬁ cant (p = 0.525, by 
Fisher exact test).
A total of 18 (2.6%, 95% conﬁ dence interval 1.4%–
3.8%) rodents from all survey sites except Xinjiang Au-
tonomous Region were positive for 2 or 3 agents, among 
which 15 were positive for 2 agents. A Clethrionomys rufo-
canus rodent from Heilongjiang Province was positive for 
A. phagocytophilum, B. burgdorferi, and SFG rickettsiae, 
and 2 rodents (Apodemus agrarius and Tamias sibiricu) 
from Jilin Province were positive for A. phagocytophilum, 
B. burgdorferi, and F. tularensis (online Appendix Table 
1, available from www.cdc.gov/EID/content/15/12/1904-
appT1.htm).
Overall, except for 6 unclassiﬁ ed rodents, 23 species 
of rodents captured at the 6 survey sites were identiﬁ ed. 
Rodent species composition varied greatly at different 
sites (online Appendix Table 2, available from www.cdc.
gov/EID/content/15/12/1904-appT2.htm). Rattus norvegi-
cus rodents were found at all survey sites except Xinjiang 
Autonomous Region. A. agrarius, A. peninsulae, Clethri-
onomys rufocanus, Mus musculus, and T. sibiricu rodents 
were found in northeastern China; A. sylvaticus, Niviventer 
confucianus, and R. losea were found mainly in southern 
China; and Meriones unguieulataus and M. musculus were 
found mainly in western China.
The dominant rodent species differed at various study 
sites. C. rufocanus (57.8%) was dominant in Heilongjiang 
Province, A. agrarius (36.2%) and A. peninsulae (27.1%) 
in Jilin Province, A. agrarius (29.7%) and Microtus maxi-
mowiczii (23.7%) in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, 
M. musculus (50.0%) and M. unguieulataus (34.1%) in 
Xinjiang Autonomous Region, N. confucianus (53,0%) 
in Zhejiang Province, and R. norvegicus (32.14%) and M. 
musculus (28.6%) in Guizhou Province (online Appendix 
Table 2).
To conﬁ rm the presence and determine genotypes of 
detected organisms, PCR products were sequenced and 
analyzed. A 919-bp partial 16S rRNA gene fragment for A. 
phagocytophilum was obtained from each positive speci-
men (8). A. phagocytophilum sequences detected in rodents 
from Heilongjiang and Jilin provinces (GenBank accession 
Discussion
We detected A. phagocytophilum, B. burgdorferi, SFG 
rickettsiae, and F. tularensis in diverse species of rodents 
from different areas of China. Our ﬁ ndings and previous 
evidence (6,9,12–15) suggest that several tick-borne agents 
cocirculate in mainland China, and a variety of rodent spe-
cies may be involved in enzootic maintenance of these 
agents. 
This study was not intended to be a comprehensive 
survey on active infections with A. phagocytophilum, B. 
burgdorferi, SFG rickettsiae, and F. tularensis. Rather, it 
was designed to investigate the presence and extent of these

Tick-borne Agents in Rodents, China
known to play a role in transmitting F. tularensis from 
animal hosts to humans, although other arthropods such 
as deer ﬂ ies, ﬂ eas, mites, and mosquitoes are known to 
carry the bacterium. Sequence analysis showed that all F. 
tularensis detected in this study belong to the subspecies 
holarctica.
Interference of infections among A. phagocytophilum, 
B. burgdorferi, SFG rickettsiae, and F. tularensis in rodent 
hosts is not clear. Our ﬁ ndings indicate that infection with 
A. phagocytophilum does not intensify risk for transmis-
sion of the other 3 agents and vice versa. B. burgdorferi 
in rodents appears to increase risk for infection with F. tu-
larensis but does not increase the possibility of infection 
with SFG rickettsiae or A. phagocytophilum. Further in-
vestigations are needed to demonstrate positive or negative 
interactions of the pathogens and to establish whether this 
interference is associated with the animal species.
Of 705 rodents tested in this study, 15 were infected 
with 2 agents and 3 were infected with 3 agents. These 
ﬁ ndings indicate that mixed natural foci of tick-borne 
agents are present at the study sites. Because A. phago-
cytophilum, B. burgdorferi, SFG rickettsiae, and F. tu-
larensis were found in ticks collected in the study areas 
(6–9,12–14), it is not surprising that multiple agents were 
detected in rodents. Coexistence of multiple agents might 
be caused by a single bite of a tick infected with several 
agents or multiple bites of ticks infected with at least 1 
agent. The presence of 4 pathogens in the study areas 
demonstrates the risk for multiple infections in humans, 
which may lead to variations and exacerbation of clini-
cal signs (1). Therefore, differential diagnoses should be 
made for febrile patients with a history of tick bites in 
these areas, particularly when clinical signs are atypical 
for 1 disease or a related disease.
Among 23 rodent species trapped in this study, 21 
were infected with >1 agent (online Appendix Table 2). 
Only 2 species (Cricetulus migratourius and N. fulvescens) 
were negative for all 4 agents. Which species is the main 
host of each agent remains unknown, because none of the 
agents are predominantly associated with 1 or a few related 
rodent species, regardless of their geographic origin. How-
ever, A. phagocytophilum, B. burgdorferi, SFG rickettsiae, 
and F. tularensis in various rodent species illustrate the 
potential roles of various rodents in maintaining these tick-
borne agents. Systematic epidemiologic studies that inves-
tigate characteristics of natural foci and the role of small 
wild animals in transmission of these agents to humans are 
needed.

agents in China. If one considers that human infections 
with A. phagocytophilum, B. burgdorferi, SFG rickettsiae, 
and F. tularensis have been reported in various regions of 
China (16–19), the presence of these agents in rodents in 
the study areas suggests a potential threat to humans, and 
the public health role of these ﬁ ndings should be further 
investigated.
Although infectivity rates varied at different survey 
sites (Table, online Appendix Table 1), we could not de-
termine the geographic diversity of these agents in rodents. 
The number of rodents examined was limited; therefore, 
infectivity rates in the current study could be biased. In 
addition, because intensity of circulation of any vector-
borne agent ﬂ uctuates dramatically throughout the year 
and from year to year, even at the same location (20,21), 
we could not justify comparing infectivity rates between 
different sites on the basis of unsynchronized single col-
lections over a 3-year period. A randomized sampling 
scheme and further collection of rodents are required to 
clarify this issue. Unfortunately, we did not collect the 
ticks from captured rodents for additional testing of the 
tick-transmitted agents. This limitation prevented us from 
understanding vector potential.
In this study, A. phagocytophilum was detected only 
in eastern China (Table, Figure), where it coexists with the 
other 3 agents (online Appendix Table 1). A. phagocyto-
philum detected in Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Zhejiang prov-
inces were closely related to each other by 16S rRNA gene 
sequence analysis, but less related to other known strains 
in other countries. B. burgdorferi was detected in rodents 
from all 6 survey sites. As observed in a previous study 
(9), B. garinii was the dominant genospecies in mainland 
China, and the B. valaisiana–related group was present in 
southern China.
SFG rickettsiae, including ≈20 species of rickettsiae, 
can be transmitted to animals and humans not only by ticks 
but also by other arthropods such as infected lice, ﬂ eas, and 
mites (10). In this study, we ampliﬁ ed the ompA gene, which 
is present in most SFG rickettsiae (10,22). The overall in-
fectivity rate for SFG rickettsiae was highest (9.1%) among 
the 4 agents tested (online Appendix Table 1). Sequence 
analysis identiﬁ ed the Rickettsia sp. detected in Heilongji-
ang Province and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region as 
a genotype of R. sibirica, which is known to cause Siberian 
tick typhus (18). However, we did not sequence PCR prod-
ucts ampliﬁ ed from rodents at other study sites because of 
a limited amount of samples. Although sequence analysis 
of the ompA gene fragment is not sufﬁ cient to identify the 
agent (22), it is commonly used to recognize tick-borne 
Rickettsia spp. in ﬁ eld surveys (23).
F. tularensis was found only in northern China, which 
veriﬁ es our belief that F. tularensis is present only north 
of 30°N latitude. In many disease-endemic areas, ticks are

Respiratory Virus Threat

The outbreak of inﬂ uenza A pandemic (H1N1) 2009 
prompted many countries in Asia, previously strongly af-
fected by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), to 
respond with stringent measures, particularly in preventing 
outbreaks in hospitals. We studied actual direct costs and 
cost-effectiveness of different response measures from a 
hospital perspective in tertiary hospitals in Singapore by 
simulating outbreaks of SARS, pandemic (H1N1) 2009, 
and 1918 Spanish inﬂ uenza. Protection measures target-
ing only infected patients yielded lowest incremental cost/
death averted of $23,000 (US$) for pandemic (H1N1) 2009. 
Enforced protection in high-risk areas (Yellow Alert) and full 
protection throughout the hospital (Orange Alert) averted 
deaths but came at an incremental cost of up to $2.5 million/
death averted. SARS and Spanish inﬂ uenza favored more 
stringent measures. High case-fatality rates, virulence, and 
high proportion of atypical manifestations impacted cost-ef-
fectiveness the most. A calibrated approach in accordance 
with viral characteristics and community risks may help re-
ﬁ ne responses to future epidemics.
P
andemic inﬂ uenza A (H1N1) 2009 virus is a new in-
ﬂ uenza virus of swine origin that was ﬁ rst detected in 
April 2009. Within 4 months of its appearance in Mexico, 
it had spread to >100 countries, with >200,000 conﬁ rmed 
cases globally, including >2,000 deaths (1). When the

World Health Organization (WHO) raised its global inﬂ u-
enza pandemic alert to phase 5 (imminent pandemic) on 
April 27, 2009, many countries followed suit and activated 
their pandemic preparedness plans, although this varied be-
tween countries. Many countries with direct experience of 
the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) out-
break tended toward more stringent measures.
Singapore was one of the countries most affected by 
SARS and experienced a disproportionate impact of the 
spread of the disease in hospitals (2,3). A total of 98 health-
care workers in Singapore were infected with SARS, 6 of 
whom died (4). After the SARS experience, Singapore’s 
Ministry of Health (MOH) developed a pandemic inﬂ uenza 
plan with several levels of response that correlated roughly 
with the WHO Pandemic Alert Response system (5). The 
Disease Outbreak Response System (DORSCON)-FLU 
system that MOH devised requires progressively higher 
levels of infection control in hospitals in addition to bor-
der screening, restrictions on visitors to hospitals, and 
community-based syndromic surveillance for acute febrile 
illnesses (Table 1).
In accordance with the progressive elevation of WHO 
pandemic alert levels, Singapore raised its own pandemic 
alert level to Yellow on April 27, 2009, and further elevat-
ed it to Orange 2 days later. At this level, all hospital staff 
were required to wear N95 masks when dealing with all pa-
tients. Patients were restricted to 1 registered and screened 
visitor, all medical and nursing student rotations and lo-
cal medical conferences were cancelled, leave restrictions 
for healthcare workers (HCWs) were put in place, inter-
hospital movement of patients and HCWs was banned, and

We made use of this unique opportunity to evaluate 
the real costs of our primary prevention interventions and 
their potential cost-effectiveness against different models 
of inﬂ uenza virulence and transmissibility in a simulated 
outbreak in our 1,000-bed tertiary teaching hospital to un-
derstand the relative incremental cost per additional death 
averted at different alert status levels. The key variables 
that affected the cost-effectiveness ratio the most were 
identiﬁ ed and studied. The same analysis was subsequently 
repeated for a parallel 1,500-bed tertiary teaching hospi-
tal. Using the outcome variables of disease cases, deaths, 
and incremental cost per death averted, we sought to deter-
mine if a calibrated and measured response plan based on 
characteristics of the virus in the outbreak could be better 
deﬁ ned.
further limitations were placed on elective surgery. These 
measures were aimed primarily at avoiding a repeat of the 
SARS epidemic where nosocomial transmission originated 
with patients whose SARS infections were undiagnosed in 
hospital, and because inﬂ uenza may be contagious before 
symptoms develop in infected patients. In fact, nosocomial 
inﬂ uenza has been well documented since the 1957 Asian 
inﬂ uenza pandemic (6). Based on studies conducted pri-
marily in the United States, it has been estimated that 1 
nosocomial case of inﬂ uenza in a pediatric unit can cost up 
to $7,500 (US) (7). A recent review (8) of 28 nosocomial 
outbreaks of seasonal inﬂ uenza summarized the evidence 
for nosocomial transmission of inﬂ uenza in hospitals with 
accompanying illness and death (8,9).
When it subsequently became apparent that the case-
fatality rate for pandemic (H1N1) 2009 was much lower 
than previously thought, especially in settings of industrial-
ized countries, the alert level in Singapore was lowered to 
Yellow on May 11, 2009, even as WHO moved to alert 
level 6 after the pandemic was declared.
The risks and impacts of an outbreak will no doubt de-
pend on the transmissibility, virulence, and clinical severity 
of illness. Thus, the beneﬁ ts of a high alert status response 
at the onset of an outbreak as a “safe rather than sorry” 
strategy is not unreasonable when faced with an unknown 
novel potentially lethal virus. Yet, on the other hand, pre-
ventive measures from a hospital perspective come with a 
price. Direct costs include activation as well as ongoing ad-
ministrative, manpower, and logistic resources, such as use 
of enhanced personal protective equipment, as part of the 
alert response measures.
Methods
To determine the cost incurred per day over the period 
where hospitals were at DORSCON Yellow and Orange, 
we obtained actual direct and indirect costs from the Op-
erations and Finance Departments of the hospitals. Excess 
costs were measured by comparing these with operating 
costs and results over the same period in 2008.
To simulate a hospital outbreak, we used a decision 
analysis model to perform cost-effectiveness analysis to 
determine the impact of an outbreak from a single index 
case that was not detected by hospital surveillance and was 
found in the general ward. The Markov decision model was 
built using Treeage software (www.treeage.com), and sim-
ulation was performed based on hospital staff and inpatients 
(n = 7,500) over a time horizon of 30 days. Each person

would transit between exclusive Markov states of Suscep-
tible, Exposed, Incubation, Infectious, Isolated, Atypical, 
Recovered, or Dead. (Figure 1). The scenario assumes that 
all clinical cases will be identiﬁ ed and isolated. Infection 
is thus transmitted in the preclinical infectious phase or by 
atypical or subclinical cases not recognized and hence not 
isolated, as well as through the failure of personal protec-
tive equipment. Variables studied in the model included the 
number of persons exposed per infected patient, secondary 
attack rate, percentage of atypical and subclinical cases, 
duration of preclinical infectious period, and infectious pe-
riod, as well as case-fatality rate.
Based on preliminary data available at the time of writ-
ing, comparisons were made between 3 respiratory viruses: 
a SARS-like virus, a 1918 Spanish inﬂ uenza–like virus, 
and a pandemic (H1N1) 2009–type virus. Validation of the 
model was performed by comparing generated reproduc-
tion numbers to reported estimates from actual SARS data 
in Singapore (10) and Spanish inﬂ uenza (for conﬁ ned ar-
eas) (11) and showed consistent case and death numbers. 
We compared 4 different strategies: 1) no additional mea-
sures; 2) Green Alert response, which mandated personal 
protective equipment (PPE) for HCWs in direct contact 
with patients suspected of having avian inﬂ uenza or other 
emerging infectious diseases; 3) Yellow Alert response, 
which mandated enhanced PPE at all high-risk areas; and 
4) Orange Alert response, which mandated N95 masks 
for all patient contact and the restrictions described above 
(Table 1). Outcome measures were number of patients in-
fected, number of deaths, cost (in US$) per case prevented, 
and cost per death prevented compared to baseline where 
no preventive measures were implemented, as well as in-
cremental cost per death averted compared with the corre-
sponding lower level of alert status. Multivariate sensitivity 
analysis was performed to understand the impact of viral 
characteristics as well as different hospital response poli-
cies on cost-effectiveness outcomes. The number of persons 
exposed in hospital and protective gear failure rates were 
from an actual outbreak simulation exercise performed at 
our hospital (12). Because there were no cases of pandemic 
(H1N1) 2009 virus infections during this period, estimates 
were all based on those in the literature (13). Details of the 
input variables are included in Table 2.
Results
An outbreak of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 from intro-
duction by an HCW, a patient with undiagnosed infection, 
or a visitor in our hospital at base case with no protection 
measures will result in 2,580 infected patients at 30 days. 
This ﬁ nding would be similar to that of seasonal inﬂ uenza 
and correspond to a 30% attack rate. With a 0.4% mortality 
rate, there would be 10 deaths from infection with pandem-
ic (H1N1) 2009 virus. In contrast, Spanish inﬂ uenza would 
result in 3,210 infected patients and 161 deaths (case-fa-
tality rate 5%). The increased number of infections in the 
Spanish inﬂ uenza model is driven by the short incubation 
time of the epidemic and results in more rounds of infection 
rather than an increase in basic reproductive number (aver-
age number of secondary cases per index case) (14). On the 
other hand, because SARS has a longer incubation period 
and lower transmissibility rate, the number of infected pa-
tients is lower at 825 but, owing to the high case-fatality 
rates, 82 deaths may ensue (Table 3).
Green Alert status mandates PPE for HCWs in direct 
contact with patients suspected of having the infection. 
Transmission will thus be only through preclinical cases 
before they are identiﬁ ed and patients can be isolated or 
through atypical or subclinical cases that are missed. We 
assumed pandemic (H1N1) 2009 has a lowered 50% trans-
missibility for atypical or subclinical cases (15); this rate 
effectively reduced the infected patients to 316 with only 
1 death (Figure 2, panel B). This resulted in additional 
costs of $95 to prevent 1 additional infected patient and 
$23,600 to prevent 1 death. Moving to Yellow Alert would 
reduce infected patients to 59 and avert all deaths. The 
costs to prevent additional infection and death are $3,221 
and $828,000, respectively. Activating Orange alert with 
full PPE gear, restricting visitors, and cancelling elective 
procedures would halve the infections to only 24 cases 
with no deaths. However, the additional cost over Yellow 
Alert would escalate to $7,153 per infection prevented and 
a staggering $2.5 million to inﬁ nity for 1 death averted 
(Figure 3).
Simulation for Spanish inﬂ uenza showed a decreased 
number of deaths from 31 at Green Alert to 6 at Yellow 
Alert and 3 at Orange Alert (Figure 2, panel B). This ﬁ nd-
ing translated to $50,000 per death averted moving from 
Green to Yellow and $153,000 per death averted moving 
from Yellow Alert to Orange. For SARS, on the other hand, 
the incremental cost of moving from Green Alert to Yellow

the most cost-effective strategy. The other variables had an 
impact on cost per case prevented but did not impact the 
incremental cost per death averted ratio.
To determine the impact of hospital size on our model, 
we modeled our simulation on the nation’s other tertiary 
hospital with 1,500 beds using their actual cost records. The 
model estimates that 10 expected deaths in the outbreak 
would be reduced to 1 death under Green Alert and none 
in Yellow and Orange Alerts. The incremental cost/death 
averted is $32,000, $1.9 million, and $5.4 million when 
moving from Green to Yellow to Orange, respectively. Al-
though the cost ranking is consistent with that predicted by 
base-case simulation, the actual incremental cost index is 
much higher, reﬂ ecting the higher cost for activating alert 
status in a bigger hospital.
is $120,000 per death averted; this drops to $75,000 when 
moving from Yellow to Orange. This ﬁ nding is mainly due 
to the high (10%) case-fatality rate and the relatively higher 
percentage of atypical patients who are missed and not iso-
lated, a lesson learned from the actual SARS experience 
(Figure 3).
Sensitivity analysis showed that the factors that im-
pacted the cost-effectiveness ratio most are case-fatality 
rate, patient exposure rate, and secondary attack rate 
(Figure 4). In the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 scenario, the case 
fatality-rate ranging from 0.1% (seasonal inﬂ uenza) to 10% 
(SARS) results in the cost per death averted moving from 
inﬁ nity (no death) to $35,000 per death averted (Orange 
Alert). Similarly, changing the exposure rate from 1.5 per-
sons/day (10% PPE failure rate, Orange Alert) to 30 per-
sons/day (0% reduction) per infected patient changed the 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio from $2.5 million per 
death averted to $23,000. If pandemic (H1N1) 2009 had a 
higher 50% transmission rate, Orange Alert would become

and risk of transmission from atypical cases. Infectious dis-
eases with high fatality rates and transmission from atypi-
cal cases (such as SARS) will need the full beneﬁ t of PPE 
to reduce mortality rates. This ﬁ nding is reﬂ ected in Orange 
Alert having a better cost-effectiveness ratio than Yellow 
Alert. Mild diseases with low fatality rates, such as pan-
demic (H1N1) 2009, and low incidence of atypical or sub-
clinical infectious cases have the best cost-effectiveness ra-
tio at Green Alert provided surveillance measures are able 
to identify infected patients and isolate them early. The 
cost-effectiveness ratio increases exponentially after that 
due to the much higher costs incurred. However, although 
Yellow Alert comes at a heavier price tag, it effectively 
averts any deaths. Activating Orange Alert increases cost 
with minimal beneﬁ t in mortality rate reduction. In reality, 
our model suggests that parallel efforts in contact tracing 
and voluntary quarantine may further reduce the exposure 
rate and break the chain of transmission.
Our base model took into account only direct costs as-
sociated with each alert status. In real situations, indirect 
costs such as lost revenues from cancellation of elective 
surgeries to free up hospital resources, decreased elec-
tive admissions and outpatient attendances, administrative 
costs associated with senior staff meetings, and lost clini-
cal teaching time, add up to more than the direct costs and 
would magnify the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio fur-
ther. In fact, if direct and indirect costs were included in 
the modeling, the incremental cost/death averted ratio of 
moving from Yellow Alert to Orange in pandemic (H1N1) 
2009 increased to a staggering $8–$81 million for both 
hospitals. Although these indirect costs are not part of the 
infection control process per se, surge capacity response 
plans to ensure that the healthcare system has the reserve 
pandemic response plans based on a SARS model (5). The 
lessons of the SARS epidemic, in particular the effect of 
protecting HCWs from patients with undiagnosed, uniso-
lated respiratory viral infections (16,17), have been applied 
rigorously to the pandemic plans of the Singapore Ministry 
of Health. Although it is difﬁ cult to quantify the impact of 
these interventions when they are taken as a whole, data 
from our modeling show that a nuanced approach that con-
centrates on administrative measures to isolate patients and 
selectively use PPE when working with patients suspected 
of having novel strains of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus 
would have a relatively favorable cost-effectiveness ratio.
On the other hand, the psychological and economic 
impact of SARS has been described as one of Singapore’s 
most traumatic experiences and one that left deep scars on 
the healthcare system of this country (18). It could be and 
has been argued that a draconian approach that seeks to pro-
tect all HCWs fully ensures that every case of inﬂ uenza is 
identiﬁ ed early and contacts traced. Any healthcare facility 
ensuring no second- or third-generation transmission would 
provide intangible gains that exceed the economic costs of 
such a strategy. Nevertheless, this desire must still be bal-
anced against the community impact of a disease such as 
inﬂ uenza, which has a different epidemiology than SARS 
(7). We currently believe that pandemic (H1N1) 2009 vi-
rus causes predominantly community-based disease (13). 
Data from the United States, where infection control rec-
ommendations (19) are similar to our DORSCON Green, 
have not shown any evidence to date of large nosocomial 
outbreaks.
In our model, we have shown that cost-effectiveness 
ratio is dependent on the interplay between exposure rate, 
transmissibility (secondary attack rate), case-fatality rate,

capacity to react to a full-blown community outbreak are 
critical to all pandemic plans (20) and contribute serious 
costs to the hospital.
The major limitations of our study are that we have sim-
ulated a situation in which community infection is still rela-
tively low and the outbreak in hospital arises from 1 index 
case. When a community epidemic is established, the inci-
dence of new index cases entering the institution increases, 
especially if there are prevalent atypical or subclinically 
infected persons. In such a scenario the cost-effectiveness 
ratio of higher alert status will decrease, and it may become 
more beneﬁ cial to escalate protective measures.
Cost-effectiveness analyses merely provide a math-
ematical projection to better understand the key factors that 
affect outcomes. The actual magnitude of the cost-effec-
tiveness will vary depending on institutional cost, which 
varies between different sized hospitals and whether direct 
or indirect costs are included. Nonetheless, knowledge of 
the exponential relationship of the different viruses on the 
cost-effectiveness ranking is critical in charting response 
policy. Indirect costs of an uncontrolled pandemic are also 
economic and social, especially in Singapore where the 
economy is dependent on trade and tourism. A higher cost-
effectiveness ratio does not imply that additional lives are 
not worth saving. In the case of pandemic (H1N1) 2009, 
if it costs $2.5 million to prevent 1 death, using a median 
age of 37 years for persons who died (21) and expected 
life expectancy of 80 years (22), the incremental cost-ef-
fectiveness ratio works out to $40,000 per life-year saved. 
In addition, preventive measures go beyond saving lives 
and include resultant savings from reducing hospitaliza-
tion of infected patients and prolonged intensive care with 
mechanical ventilation for severe cases, as well as the 
logistic costs of further contact tracing and quarantine. 
We have not factored the cost of inﬂ uenza antiviral 
prophylaxis or the costs and effectiveness of novel vaccina-
tions that may be required, nor did we include the costs of 
work-days lost from staff taking medical leave due to their

of N95 masks. This has to be balanced with the degree of 
compliance that can be achieved by the use of full-scale 
PPE for patients with no risk of the disease (e.g., patients 
with trauma or other medical or surgical conditions) and 
the well known adverse effects of prolonged use of N95 
masks (23).
However, it is useful to also note that although a step-
up approach may be the most cost-effective for the health-
care institution, the appropriate policy stance at the national 
level may not necessarily be the same. Our model did not 
take into account the psychological and economic impact 
to the country and the larger healthcare system, which are 
serious factors to consider when making a policy decision 
on the appropriate response across the healthcare system. 
Singapore, Hong Kong, and China were among the settings 
most severely affected by the SARS outbreak in 2003. In 
the initial face of an unknown virus with a perceived high 
mortality rate in Mexico, Singapore’s response to ﬁ rst err 
on the side of safety and make adjustments dynamically as 
the situation became clearer therefore would be reasonable 
when viewed from the larger perspective.
Such actions, however, were not without their own ad-
verse effects in terms of cost and in overall patient care at 
the healthcare institution. We had the opportunity to per-
form a cost-effectiveness analysis using the actual costs 
incurred from this heightened infection control response. 
We have quantiﬁ ed how the virulence or case-fatality rate 
of a respiratory viral infection has a serious impact on the 
hospital infection control response. This impact occurs at 2 
levels, ﬁ rst, the actual number of deaths and ill persons, and 
second, the direct and indirect costs on the hospital in terms 
of activation, logistics, and lost revenue. This impact is re-
ﬂ ected in the subsequent responses of Singapore and other 
countries when the virulence of the novel inﬂ uenza virus 
appeared to be much less than previously feared. Under-
standing the key factors that affect the cost-effectiveness 
ratio will enable us to make better informed decisions as we 
prepare to respond to future epidemics.

being infected or being placed in quarantine. The impact of 
lax border controls, subclinical patients carrying the virus 
into the community, and closure of community institutions 
or even hospitals due to an outbreak were also not com-
puted. We assumed that the hospital is a closed community 
with a ﬁ xed number of staff and patients. This obviously is 
not true in real life but is mitigated in our analysis because 
the same assumption is applied to every response measure 
and the outcomes are incremental indices over another lev-
el of protection.
From the perspective of a healthcare institution, how 
do we predict the virulence of new virus early in the out-
break and adopt the most cost-effective response policy? If 
a mild epidemic spreads rapidly through the community, 
there might be multiple points of entry into the hospital; 
however, such a mild community outbreak might present 
more commonly to primary healthcare clinics and presenta-
tions to hospital may be few. Thus a step-up approach from 
Green to Yellow in accordance with predicted risks as we 
have shown may be the most cost-effective approach.
It is not known for certain how pandemic (H1N1) 2009 
will behave in subsequent waves. Although the new virus 
seems to have relatively low virulence, the virus might re-
emerge with a case-fatality rate more like that of the 1918 
inﬂ uenza pandemic or the SARS pandemic. Our model 
shows that DORSCON Green, which focuses on infection 
control for suspected cases, will achieve a relatively high 
degree of protection for our staff, patients, and visitors 
even in the setting of a higher case-fatality rate. The main 
advantage of DORSCON Yellow and Orange is that unde-
tected infected persons that are not isolated are less likely 
to become a source of transmission if there is universal use

Possible Interruption of Malaria 
Transmission, Highland Kenya, 
2007–2008

sion is unstable, with a low incidence of malaria during dry 
seasons (5). These areas may be ideal initial targets for at-
tempting the interruption of malaria transmission. Also in 
these areas, the combination of ACT, which may decrease 
transmission by reducing gametocyte load in infected per-
sons, and annual indoor residual spraying (IRS) with long-
lasting insecticides, which can reduce indoor vector density 
for a prolonged period, could act synergistically to interrupt 
malaria transmission.
We have conducted malaria epidemiology studies in 
the adjoining highland areas of Kipsamoite and Kapsisiywa, 
Nandi Hills District, Kenya, since 2003. Starting in 2005, 
the Ministry of Health of Kenya introduced new interven-
tions to reduce malaria transmission and improve malaria 
treatment in these areas. Interventions introduced included 
IRS, distribution of ITNs to pregnant women and their chil-
dren <5 years of age, and provision of artemether/lumefan-
trine (co-artemether) as ﬁ rst-line therapy for uncomplicated 
malaria. The present study documents the changes in ma-
laria transmission that occurred during the period of these 
interventions and provides evidence that malaria transmis-
sion was interrupted during April 2007–March 2008.
Methods
Highland areas where malaria transmission is unstable 
are targets for malaria elimination because transmission 
decreases to low levels during the dry season. In highland 
areas of Kipsamoite and Kapsisiywa, Kenya (population 
≈7,400 persons), annual household indoor residual spray-
ing with a synthetic pyrethroid was performed starting in 
2005, and artemether/lumefantrine was implemented as 
ﬁ rst-line malaria treatment in October 2006. During April 
2007–March 2008, no microscopy-conﬁ rmed cases of ma-
laria occurred at the sites. In 4 assessments of asymptom-
atic persons during May 2007–April 2008, a total of <0.3% 
of persons were positive for asexual Plasmodium falciparum 
by microscopy or PCR at any time, and none were positive 
by PCR at the last 2 sample collections. Our ﬁ ndings show 
that in such areas, interruption and eventual elimination of 
malaria transmission may be achievable with widespread 
annual indoor residual spraying of households and artemisi-
nin combination therapy.

idespread implementation of malaria control inter-
ventions such as insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs) 
and artemisinin combination therapy (ACT) have resulted 
in dramatic reductions of transmission in areas where this 
disease is endemic (1–3). For the ﬁ rst time since the 1950s, 
the World Health Organization and other organizations 
are promoting malaria eradication (4). In highland areas

Study Site
The study was conducted in the adjacent highland areas 
of Kipsamoite (7 villages) and Kapsisiywa (9 villages) in the 
Nandi Hills District of Kenya. Study site characteristics have 
been described (6). Elevation ranges from 1,829 m to 2,132 
m. In both areas, malaria transmission is unstable. A malaria 
epidemic occurred in Kipsamoite in 2002 (7). Historically, 
Kapsisiywa has had more malaria cases than Kipsamoite, 
likely because its elevation is lower, a swamp surrounds it, 
and it has more areas where water is likely to pool (6).

period and on any sample that was parasite positive by 
microscopy.
Study Population and Recruitment
Persons living in these areas are predominantly Nandi, 
a Kalenjin subtribe. Demographic analysis, malaria sur-
veillance, and collection of weather and vector density 
information were performed in these areas as part of 2 
related studies, a study of malaria early warning systems 
and a study of malaria transmission and immunity. Writ-
ten informed consent for study participation was obtained 
from consenting heads of households in the area for de-
mographic studies and from persons (or parents/guardians 
of persons <15 years of age) for other studies. Ethical ap-
proval for the study was obtained from the Kenya Medical 
Research Institute National Ethical Review Committee and 
the Institutional Review Boards for Human Studies at Case 
Western Reserve University, the Centers for Disease Con-
trol and Prevention, and the University of Minnesota.
Microscopy and PCR
Microscopy testing for Plasmodium species was per-
formed as described (7) by using 2 independent readings 
and a third reading for slides with discordant results. For 
PCR testing, genomic DNA was isolated with a QIAamp 
96 DNA blood kit (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA, USA) 
from dried blood spots collected on Whatman 903 ﬁ lter pa-
per (Whatman Corporation, Florham Park, NJ, USA). P. 
falciparum infection was detected by nested PCR speciﬁ c 
for the small subunit RNA gene as described (8). In previ-
ous surveys in these areas, we documented low frequencies 
of P. malariae infection (<1%) and no P. vivax or P. ovale 
infections (7,9) by microscopy and PCR. Thus, we did not 
further test for these infections.
Assessment of Rainfall, Temperature, 
and Indoor Resting Vector Density
Daily rainfall was measured with standard metal rain 
gauges, and daily minimum and maximum temperatures 
were recorded with maximum/minimum mercury ther-
mometers placed in 7 villages in Kipsamoite. Values from 
the 7 villages were averaged.
Household indoor resting density of Anopheles spp. 
was measured in 4 cluster areas at each site; each cluster 
area comprised approximately equal numbers of persons. 
Three index households were randomly selected for each 
cluster, and the index house plus its 4 nearest neighbors 
were sampled. Sixty households in Kipsamoite and 60 
households in Kapsisiywa were sampled every 2 weeks. 
Pyrethrum knockdown captures were conducted by using 
standard methods (10). Anopheles spp. mosquitoes were 
identiﬁ ed taxonomically, ﬁ rst in the ﬁ eld by trained ﬁ eld 
assistants and then by an entomologist from the Kenya 
Medical Research Institute.
Demography and Surveillance for Clinical 
Malaria and Asymptomatic Persons
Demographic surveys of all households were started 
in April 2003 and conducted every 4 to 6 months. Start-
ing in 2005, these surveys included assessments of travel, 
ITN use, and IRS treatment of houses. Clinical malaria 
surveillance was conducted during 2003–2008 Kenyan 
Ministry of Health dispensaries, the only healthcare fa-
cilities within the study area. Free malaria diagnosis and 
treatment were available to all persons with symptoms of 
malaria. Persons with symptoms of malaria (fever, chills, 
severe malaise, headache) who did not have a clear al-
ternative diagnosis by history and physical examination 
were assessed for malaria by microscopic examination of 
blood smears.
Clinical malaria was deﬁ ned as symptoms of malaria 
and a positive blood smear for Plasmodium falciparum or P. 
malariae. Primary treatment for uncomplicated malaria was 
given according to Kenya Ministry of Health provisions for 
the clinics: sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (2003–2004), amo-
diaquine (2004–2006), and co-artemether (2006–2008). 
Because of changes in studies, forms, and clinic person-
nel, clinical surveillance was not conducted in January and 
July–November 2006, in Kipsamoite; and July–December 
2005, and January, March, and June–November 2006, in 
Kapsisiywa.
Four surveys for parasitemia in asymptomatic persons 
were conducted during 2007–2008. In May 2007, samples 
were collected from all consenting persons who were liv-
ing on site during the time of collection (5,788 persons). 
In August 2007, samples were collected from 605 per-
sons randomly selected from the overall population for 
active surveillance of malaria. Testing was repeated in 
samples from 577 and 538 of these persons in the cohort 
in November 2007 and April 2008, respectively. PCR was 
performed on 400 randomly selected samples from each 
Data Analysis
Annual malaria incidence, rainfall, temperature, and 
vector density during April 2003–March 2004, were used 
as baseline data and compared with data from subsequent 
years beginning in April 2004. Annual malaria incidence 
was compared by using negative binomial regression 
analysis, except for April 2007–March 2008, when it was 
compared by Fisher exact test because no cases occurred 
during that year. For years with missing months of inci-
dence data, malaria incidence in the recorded months was 
compared with incidence in the same months in the refer-
ence year (April 2003–March 2004). For periods when no 
cases were detected, a 1-sided 95% conﬁ dence interval was 
constructed. Mean daily temperature and mean monthly 
rainfall were compared by using the 2-sample t test. Me-

IRS, ITNs, and Malaria Treatment with 
Co-artemether at Health Centers
The population ranged from 3,250 to 4,253 in Kipsam-
oite and from 3,412 to 3,841 in Kapsisiywa. The Ministry 
of Health ﬁ rst conducted limited indoor residual spray-
ing in 2005. The number of households sprayed increased 
markedly in 2007 (Table 1). The primary insecticide used 
in both sites was lambda cyhalothrin at a dose of 10–20 
mg/m2.
ITNs were distributed per Ministry of Health policy to 
pregnant women and their children <5 years of age when 
the women came to the health centers for antenatal care. 
A copayment was required in most instances. Short-lasting 
nets treated with α-cypermethrin were provided during 
2005–2006, and long-lasting nets treated with deltamethrin 
or permethrin have been provided since 2006. Persons were 
asked, “Have you slept under a treated bednet regularly 
since the last demography survey?” During 2006–2008, the 
percentage of persons who reported sleeping under an ITN 
decreased from 17.3% to 11.1% in Kipsamoite and from 
27.9% to 15.1% in Kapsisiywa.
Co-artemether became ofﬁ cial ﬁ rst-line treatment for 
uncomplicated malaria by Kenyan Ministry of Health pol-
icy in May 2004, but it was not implemented in these sites 
until October 23, 2006 (Kapsisiwya) and February 6, 2007 
(Kipsamoite). Co-artemether was also not widely available 
in local shops or neighboring clinics before these dates.
Malaria and Symptoms Consistent 
with Malaria, 2003–2008
When compared with the April 2003–March 2004 
reference year, malaria incidence in Kipsamoite increased 
in 2004, returned to 2003 levels in 2005, and decreased in 
2006 (Table 2, Figure 1, panel A). In contrast, malaria in-
cidence decreased slightly in Kapsisiywa in 2004 and then 
decreased in 2005 and 2006 (Table 2, Figure 1, panel B). 
Malaria incidence in Kapsisiywa was higher than in Kip-
samoite in 2003 (p<0.001) and 2004 (p = 0.06), but not in 
any other year. At both sites during March 20, 2007–March 
30, 2008, microscopically conﬁ rmed cases of malaria were 
found among symptomatic persons (Table 2, Figure 1, pan-
els A and B).
Overall clinic attendance, although seasonal and vari-
able, did not decrease during 2007–2008 at either site (Fig-
ure 1, panels C and D). During March 20, 2007–March 30, 
2008, when 0 of 416 symptomatic persons had evidence 
of P. falciparum parasitemia by microscopy (0%, 1-sided 
95% conﬁ dence interval 0%–0.9%), 17 (7.3%) of 231 
symptomatic persons who provided blood samples for PCR 
testing were positive for P. falciparum. All PCR-positive 
samples were obtained during March–June, 2007, except

Changes in Rainfall, Temperature, and

During 2003–2008, no consistent pattern of increased 
or decreased temperature was shown, and the average daily 
temperature during 2007–2008, the year in which no malar-
ia cases were documented by microscopy, was most similar 
to that in 2003, the year of highest malaria incidence (Figure 
2, panel A, Table 4). Average monthly rainfall did not dif-
fer between years (Figure 2, panel B, Table 4). A decrease 
in anopheline mosquito density was seen in 2004, before 
any widespread IRS treatment program, but sustained low 
levels of mosquito density were ﬁ rst seen after IRS treat-
ments (Figure 2, panel C; Table 5). Of 447 anopheline mos-
quitoes caught over this 5-year period, 439 (98.21%) were 
identiﬁ ed as An. gambiae, 6 (1.34%) were identiﬁ ed as An.

phozoites or gametocytes by microscopy during any period. 
In the last 2 periods, no person was positive for asexual P. 
falciparum by PCR (Table 3). The person positive for P. 
falciparum trophozoites by microscopy in April 2008 was 
also positive for gametocytes. PCR showed that this person 
did not have an asexual P. falciparum infection.

Discussion
Implementation of highly effective methods of de-
creasing malaria transmission, including ITNs, IRS, and 
ACT, has led to renewed discussion about global eradi-
cation of malaria (4,11). A major goal in moving toward 
eradicating malaria is interruption or elimination of local 
malaria transmission. The World Health Organization has 
stated that “elimination has been achieved when the ‘pre-
vention of reintroduction’, without local transmission by 
mosquitoes, has been successful for three or more consecu-
tive years” (12). Interruption of local transmission is the 
step before elimination, in which it is documented that local 
transmission of malaria is absent in a previously malaria-
endemic area for a speciﬁ c period. The present study pro-
vides microscopy evidence of interruption of local malaria 
transmission in 2 adjacent highland areas of unstable trans-
mission. Malaria could recur in these areas, and it is unclear 
precisely how much speciﬁ c factors (e.g., IRS, ACT, and 
changes in rainfall and temperature) affected malaria trans-
mission and incidence. Overall, however, data support the 
idea that in unstable transmission settings, combining regu-
lar, widespread IRS campaigns and use of ACT as ﬁ rst-line 
antimalarial treatment has the potential to interrupt local 
malaria transmission.
IRS probably played a major role in reducing malaria 
transmission in these areas for several reasons. First, sus-
tained decreases in indoor resting Anopheles spp. mosquito 
density were seen after the IRS campaigns. Second, in 
both sites, malaria incidence decreased only after IRS was 
widely applied. In Kipsamoite, no large reduction in ma-
laria incidence was seen until 2007, when spraying covered 
>70% of households. In Kapsisiywa, ≈50% of households 
were sprayed in 2005 and 2006, and a large decrease in ma-
laria incidence was observed in both years. In 2007, after 
>90% of households were sprayed, malaria transmission 
was interrupted for the subsequent year. Third, in contrast 
to IRS, 2 factors that could affect vector density and there-
fore malaria incidence, rainfall and temperature, showed 
no clear relationship with either vector density or malaria 
incidence.
A reduction in vector density was seen in both sites in 
2003 before the IRS campaigns. Potential reasons for this 
reduction include an unusual decrease in temperature dur-
ing July–September 2003 (Figure 2). This decrease in tem-
perature coincided with the ﬁ rst decrease in vector density; 
another possible reason for the decrease was pyrethrum 
spray catch testing of anopheline vectors conducted by our 
team, which started in April 2003.  Although spraying with 
short-term insecticide does not usually affect vector density 
in areas of high transmission, spraying of approximately 
one sixth of all households every 2 weeks may have had an 
effect on the adult vector population, which led to a smaller 
breeding pool and lower overall vector density in this area 
of low transmission. The decrease in malaria incidence in 
Kipsamoite in 2005, after only 15% of households were 
sprayed, may in part reﬂ ect the effects of greater spraying 
in neighboring Kapsisiywa. The decrease may also reﬂ ect 
the combined effect of partial coverage with ITNs and ad-
ditional coverage by IRS. Reduction of incidence in Kip-
samoite in 2005 was not caused by concentrated spraying in 
areas of malaria clustering (5) because spraying was near-
ly absent in these areas. Reductions in malaria incidence 
were seen in Kapsisiywa in 2005–2006 after spraying of 
40%–50% of households, but the small peak in incidence 
seen subsequently in these 2 years, but not 2007 (Figure 1), 
suggests that for interruption, a higher percentage of house-
holds (>70%) must be sprayed.
Treatment of malaria patients with co-artemether re-
duces gametocyte carriage and density in children and 
makes them less infectious to mosquitoes than treatment 
with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine plus chloroquine (13). 
The effect of co-artemether on gametocytes may have 
been synergistic with the effect of widespread IRS on the 
Anopheles spp. vector in reducing malaria transmission. In

symptomatic persons, gametocyte prevalence was always 
low, and it decreased before introduction of co-artemether, 
but it did not decrease to undetectable levels in Kipsamoite 
until after introduction of co-artemether. Among asymp-
tomatic persons, studies during 1999–2002 generally dem-
onstrated higher gametocyte prevalence (0%–5.7%) (7). 
Lower prevalence among asymptomatic persons in the cur-
rent study (0%–0.2% during May 2007–April 2008) could 
reﬂ ect effects of co-artemether on gametocyte prevalence 
after introduction of co-artemether in late 2006–early 2007, 
but without interim data from 2002–2006, an association 
cannot be clearly demonstrated. As with IRS, however, ab-
sence of microscopy-positive malaria cases occurred only 
after introduction of co-artemether. Because co-artemether 
was ﬁ rst used during a time of low transmission of malaria, 
the contribution of ACT to the absence of malaria incidence 
could not be quantiﬁ ed in the present study. However, a 
much larger study in South Africa in which IRS treatment 
and ACT treatment of persons with clinical malaria were 
introduced sequentially demonstrated an additional reduc-
tion of malaria incidence after introduction of ACT (14) 
and this supports the idea of synergy between these 2 in-
terventions.
Although ITNs are the preferred intervention for pre-
venting malaria-related illness and death in areas of high 
transmission (1,15,16), ITNs probably did not play a major 
role in interrupting malaria transmission in the highland ar-
eas we studied. ITN coverage never exceeded 30% in either 
area, and use actually decreased over the study period. In 
areas of unstable transmission, IRS treatment once a year 
is likely to be easier, more effective, and more accepted 
than ITNs. The Roll Back Malaria program currently rec-
ommends IRS as the preferred method of reducing malaria 
in areas of low transmission (17); our study supports this 
recommendation.
Insecticide treatment using IRS is not without prob-
lems; chief among them is potential development of resis-
tance to the insecticide. Lambda-cyhalothrin, the insecti-
cide used for IRS in these areas by the Kenyan Ministry of 
Health, was used in Mozambique for IRS starting in 1993, 
but resistance developed to such an extent that lambda cy-
halothrin was replaced by bendiocarb in 2000. By 2006, 
however, lambda cyhalothrin resistance had decreased in 
many areas (18). In a recent study in nearby areas of west-
ern Kenya, no phenotypic resistance to pyrethroid insecti-
cides was seen, but 27% of anophelines carried the knock-
down resistance (kdr) mutation associated with increased 
resistance to pyrethroids (19). Assessment for insecticide 
resistance in the highland areas of the present study will 
enable better policy decisions to be made about continued 
use of lambda cyhalothrin, use of alternatives such as ben-
diocarb or DDT, or cycling of insecticides when certain re-
sistance thresholds are reached for a particular insecticide.

†Means were compared by using the 2-sample t test. 
Because reverse transcription–PCR methods for de-
tection of gametocytes have documented higher rates of 
gametocyte infection than microscopy (22,23), we are de-
veloping this testing method in our laboratory to conﬁ rm 
the absence of gametocytemia in the most recent samples 
from study participants. The presence of asexual P. falci-
parum infection by PCR in 15 symptomatic persons during 
April–June 2007 could reﬂ ect prolonged detection by this 
more sensitive method. The presence of only 2 PCR-pos-
itive cases in a 9-month period (July 2007–March 2008) 
suggests that malaria transmission was either interrupted, 
if these cases were caused by patients’ travel, or reduced to 
almost undetectable levels.
Sustained elimination of local malaria transmission in 
these areas will require ongoing surveillance of malaria in-
cidence, anopheline vector density, and anopheline insec-
ticide resistance, and correctly timed IRS campaigns with 
broad coverage of the area (24). The longer populations 
at these sites are unexposed to malaria, the more suscep-
tible they are to malaria epidemics, which could occur if 
an increase in vector density occurs in conjunction with the 
arrival of infected persons or mosquitoes from an area of 
higher transmission of malaria. Because travel is increas-
ingly frequent, true elimination of malaria in this and other 
highland areas will require reduction and eventual elimina-
tion of malaria in surrounding areas. Co-artemether must be 
consistently available to treat any infected and symptomatic 
travelers or immigrants to the area. Finally, as malaria cas-
es decrease, microscopists will need to receive training to 
remain proﬁ cient in detection of malaria in blood smears.
In summary, this study demonstrates pronounced re-
duction and possible interruption of malaria transmission 
in 2 highland areas of Kenya for a 1-year period and pro-
as 1999 (20). Resistance to co-artemether has not yet been 
documented in Kenya, but development of resistance to 
components of artemether/lumefantrine in nearby popula-
tions with higher levels of transmission would also pose a 
threat to this highland population. Monitoring of drug resis-
tance to ACT in all areas in which malaria is endemic will 
be critical for sustaining reduction of malaria incidence in 
sub-Saharan Africa.
Limitations of our study include missing monthly ma-
laria incidence data among symptomatic persons during 
2005–2006, the observational nature of the study, and the 
possibility that lack of parasitemia by microscopy and PCR 
in symptomatic and asymptomatic persons was caused by 
seasonal variation common in highland areas (21) and not 
by interruption of local transmission. However, 3 pieces of 
evidence from studies of asymptomatic and symptomatic 
persons support interruption of local transmission rather 
than seasonal variation. First, no parasitemia was seen in 
2 successive microscopy and PCR surveys of asymptom-
atic persons, whereas in 5 earlier surveys of asymptomatic 
persons in Kipsamoite, the area of lower transmission, the 
frequency of infected persons was never zero (range 5.9%–
14.5% by PCR) (7). Second, over 7 years of clinic surveil-
lance of symptomatic persons in Kipsamoite and 5 years in 
Kapsisiywa, there was never a >4-month period in which 
there were no microscopy-positive cases of P. falciparum 
before March 2007. Thus, even with seasonal variation, a 
year with no microscopy-positive cases in these areas is 
unprecedented. Third, absence of gametocytemia by mi-
croscopy was documented among asymptomatic persons in 
2 of 4 assessments and among symptomatic persons for a 
year (April 2007–March 2008), which suggested that the 
potential for local transmission was low or absent.

vides evidence that interruption of transmission was related 
to widespread annual IRS insecticide treatment and use of 
ACT as ﬁ rst-line treatment for uncomplicated malaria. Al-
though both areas remain at risk for recurrence of malaria 
epidemics, our study provides evidence that interruption 
and eventual elimination of malaria in areas of unstable 
transmission may be achievable.

Community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylo-
coccus aureus (CA-MRSA) has become a major problem in 
US hospitals already dealing with high levels of hospital-as-
sociated MRSA (HA-MRSA). Using antimicrobial drug sus-
ceptibility data for 1999–2006 from The Surveillance Net-
work, we characterized the relationship between outpatient 
and inpatient levels of CA-MRSA nationally. In outpatients, 
the frequency of CA-MRSA isolates has increased >7× dur-
ing 1999–2006, which suggests that outpatients have be-

come a major reservoir for CA-MRSA. However, contrary to 
results in other reports, although CA-MRSA increases are 
associated with decreases in the frequency of HA-MRSA 
in hospitals, the decreases are only modest. This ﬁ nding 
suggests that instead of replacing HA-MRSA in the hospi-
tal, CA-MRSA is adding to the overall presence of MRSA 
already found within the hospital population.
T
he past decade has seen a large increase in infections 
with hospital-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylo-
coccus aureus (HA-MRSA) (1). MRSA is one of the most 
common causes of nosocomial infections, especially inva-
sive bacterial infections (2), and is now endemic and even 
epidemic to many US hospitals, long-term care facilities (3), 
and communities (4–6). Although community-associated

RESEARCH
MRSA (CA-MRSA) strains have been recognized as a lead-
ing cause of skin and soft tissue infections (1,6), especially in 
patients with no established healthcare risk factors (7,8), they 
also cause severe invasive infections (9,10). Recent reports 
based on genotypic evidence have suggested that CA-MRSA 
is likely spreading within hospitals as well, blurring the line 
between CA-MRSA and HA-MRSA infections (11).
Molecular typing studies have identiﬁ ed 2 MRSA 
clones, USA300 and USA400, as the primary types that 
cause CA-MRSA infections (12). Evidence suggests that 
emergence of these strains was independent of hospital 
strains (13). Thus, understanding the role of outpatients, 
who are among the likely carriers of CA-MRSA into a 
hospital, is useful for understanding the changing epide-
miology of MRSA in hospitals. Outpatients, who outnum-
ber inpatients by ≈3:1, may play a major role in the spread 
of CA-MRSA strains from the community to the hospital 
through their interaction with hospital staff or use of similar 
hospital resources, such as surgical rooms. However, lim-
ited information hinders understanding of long-term trends 
in CA-MRSA in outpatients in the context of changing epi-
demiology of inpatients. This lack of information hinders 
the ability to evaluate infection control methods in the face 
of a possible emerging epidemic of nosocomial infections 
caused by CA-MRSA.
Knowledge of trends in antimicrobial drug resistance 
rates for emerging pathogens are useful to clinicians to en-
sure high-quality care, which is essential for antimicrobial 
drug therapy, in which different drugs can have different 
costs and effectiveness. These trends can also help hospital 
administrators and policy makers make infection control 
investments to address the role that large inﬂ uxes of outpa-
tients with CA-MRSA infections may play with regard to 
overall MRSA infection rates in the hospital.
Diagnostics, Herndon, VA, USA). TSN is an electronic 
repository of antimicrobial drug susceptibility data from a 
national network of >300 microbiology laboratories in the 
United States. Participating laboratories are geographically 
dispersed and make up a nationally representative sample 
based on patient population and number of beds. Patient 
isolates are tested on site as part of routine diagnostic test-
ing for susceptibility to different antimicrobial agents by 
using standards established by the Clinical and Laboratory 
Standards Institute (17) and approved by the US Food and 
Drug Administration. Results are then ﬁ ltered to remove 
repeat isolates and identify microbiologically atypical re-
sults for conﬁ rmation or veriﬁ cation before being included 
in the TSN database. Data from the database have been 
used extensively to evaluate antimicrobial drug resistance 
patterns and trends (1,18–22).
Genotypic analysis of phenotypically deﬁ ned strains 
has found that in general, isolates of the USA300 strain, 
the one most commonly associated with CA-MRSA infec-
tions, are resistant to fewer antimicrobial drugs (14–16). 
Naimi et al. (15) tested genetically determined CA-MRSA 
isolates against several antimicrobial drugs and found that 
they were typically susceptible to ciproﬂ oxacin (79%) and 
clindamycin (83%). Similarly, King et al. (14) found that 
88% of CA-MRSA strains were resistant only to a β-lactam 
and erythromycin or a β-lactam only. Popovich et al. (16) 
also found that susceptibility to a ﬂ uoroquinolone had a 
90% positive predictive value for predicting a community-
associated strain. Additionally, the number of antimicro-
bial drugs to which an isolate was susceptible was a reliable 
predictor of the genotype (16).
We analyzed S. aureus isolates that were tested for 
susceptibility to oxacillin (a proxy for all β-lactam anti-
microbial drugs). Isolates classiﬁ ed as resistant according 
to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute breakpoint 
criteria were considered MRSA (<0.01% had intermedi-
ate resistance and were classiﬁ ed as susceptible). MRSA 
isolates, regardless of source (outpatient or inpatient), that 
were tested against ciproﬂ oxacin or clindamycin, and >3 
other drugs and found to be resistant only to oxacillin were 
classiﬁ ed as CA-MRSA strains. Isolates resistant to oxa-
cillin and >1 other drug were assumed to be HA-MRSA 
strains. Other drugs tested were gentamicin, tetracycline, 
sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, and vancomycin.
Using this framework, we determined that the mean 
number of outpatient isolates analyzed annually was 
>50,000. Isolates were stratiﬁ ed on the basis of source 
(blood, lungs, skin, and other organs). Conﬁ dence inter-
vals (CIs) for TSN data were calculated by using the Wil-
son score method incorporating continuity correction as 
detailed by Newcombe (23). Statistical analysis was per-
formed by using Stata version 10 software (StataCorp LP, 
College Station, TX, USA).
Methods
To analyze trends in frequency of CA-MRSA and HA-
MRSA, we studied changes in the proportion of isolates of 
each type that were found in inpatient and outpatient settings 
from a nationally representative sample of US hospitals dur-
ing 1999–2006. Although genotypic analysis is the most reli-
able way of identifying MRSA strains, historical genotypic 
data on isolates are not available at the national level. An al-
ternative approach is to ascertain strain type by using pheno-
typic susceptibility proﬁ les. S. aureus susceptibility proﬁ les 
are determined by the staphylococcal cassette chromosome 
(SCC) types on which the methicillin resistance gene, mecA, 
is carried. Because CA-MRSA and HA-MRSA strains typi-
cally have different SCCmec types, rules have been devel-
oped for determining the likely genetic makeup of an isolate 
on the basis of susceptibility results (11,14–16).
Phenotypic susceptibility results were obtained from

Results
Susceptibility to clindamycin, ciproﬂ oxacin, gentami-
cin, tetracycline, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, and van-
comycin was used to infer genotypes of MRSA isolates 
during 1999–2006. During this period, there was a statisti-
cally signiﬁ cant reduction (p<0.001) in the proportion of 
MRSA isolates in outpatient areas resistant to ciproﬂ oxa-
cin (84% to 56%), clindamycin (67% to 30%), gentamicin 
(30% to 3%), and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (16% to 
2%). Our phenotypic rule, which was based on suscepti-
bility to all drugs, found qualitatively similar results, with 
the proportion of MRSA isolates resistant to >1 other drug 
decreasing from 87% to 46% during the period (Figure).
For outpatient data, the proportion of all S. aureus in-
fections that were MRSA infections nearly doubled, from 
26.8% (95% CI 26.3%–27.3%) to 52.4% (95% CI 52.0%–
52.9%), over the study period. This increase was caused 
almost entirely by increases in isolates resistant only to 
oxacillin, which increased >7× from 3.6% (95% CI 3.5%–
3.7%) to 28.2% (95% CI 28.0%–28.5%). The proportion of 
isolates resistant only to oxacillin increased for skin and soft 
tissue infections. However, increases were also observed 
in invasive blood and lung infections and other infections. 
Isolates resistant to >1 other drug increased ≈5% during 
1999–2001 from 23.2% (95% CI 23.0%–23.5%) to 28.2% 
(95% CI 28.0%–28.5%) before reaching a plateau. In 2005, 
the proportion of isolates resistant to oxacillin and 1 other 
drug then decreased back to almost the same percentage it 
started at. This pattern was driven by overall increases at all 
infection sites during 1999–2001 and later decreases at all 
collection sites except skin infections (Table).
Among inpatients, the proportion of S. aureus iso-
lates that were MRSA increased 25% from 46.7% (95% CI 
46.2%–47.2%) to 58.5% (95% CI 58.0%–58.9%). Again, 
the increase was driven primarily by increases in the rate 
of isolates resistant only to oxacillin, which increased 
>7× from 3.3% (95% CI 3.1%–3.4%) to 19.8% (95% CI 
19.4%–20.1%). Similar to outpatient data, the frequency of 
skin and soft tissue infections increased for isolates resis-
tant only to oxacillin, although increases in blood, lung, and 
other infections were also observed. For isolates resistant to 
>1 other drug, a slightly different pattern was observed than 
for the pattern of outpatient isolate resistance. Instead of a 
large increase, the proportion of MRSA isolates resistant 
to >1 drug remained the same (≈43%–44%) until 2003 be-
fore decreasing >5% from 44.1% (95% CI 43.7%–44.5%) 
to 38.5% (95% CI 38.2%–38.9%) during 2003–2005. This 
decrease was largely caused by reductions in lung infec-
tions, although decreases were also seen in blood and other 
infections. Also different was the increase in MRSA skin 
isolates resistant to multiple drugs. There was an increase 
from 1999, but the increase was less (only 3%–4%) and ap-
peared to plateau at ≈12%–13%.
Discussion
We found during 1999–2006 that the percentage of S. 
aureus infections resistant to methicillin increased >90%, 
or ≈10% a year, in outpatients admitted to US hospitals. 
This increase was caused almost entirely by CA-MRSA 
strains, which increased >33% annually. Increases in the 
proportion of HA-MRSA isolates among outpatients were 
more variable, increasing ≈10% per year during 1999–2001 
before the increase slowed; the proportion then decreased 
over the second half of the study period. This reduction in 
the growth of HA-MRSA isolates corresponds to a steep 
increase in the frequency of CA-MRSA skin and soft tis-
sue infections among outpatients over an extremely short 
period, mostly during 2003–2005.
The frequency of CA-MRSA among inpatients in-
creased nearly in conjunction with outpatient rates, over-
all and at each infection site. However, increases in blood 
and lung infections increased more among inpatients than 
in outpatients, which likely reﬂ ected the more severe 
status and increased likelihood of open wounds in inpa-
tients. During this same period, rates of HA-MRSA de-
creased only ≈10%. Most of this decrease occurred during 
2003–2005 and was mainly the result of a decrease in the 
frequency of HA-MRSA lung infections. This decrease 
was more likely the result of changes in empirical antimi-
crobial drug therapy for ventilator-associated pneumonia 
(24) than a consequence of any changes in the epidemiol-
ogy of MRSA.
Despite increases in the proportion of CA-MRSA 
strains among inpatients, the continuing high level of HA-

†Data through October only. Data for blood, lungs, skin, and other source refer to the percentage of each source tested that was estimated to be CA-
MRSA or HA-MRSA. 
MRSA suggests that in contrast to reports from local insti-
tutions (11), CA-MRSA strains are adding to the problem 
of MRSA rather than replacing HA-MRSA strains. The fact 
that the frequency of HA-MRSA has decreased implies that 
some crowding out of HA-MRSA strains within the hospi-
tal may be occurring. However, lack of a decrease suggests 
that within the hospital, HA-MRSA strains may be more 
ﬁ t, and thus CA-MRSA strains are unable to replace them 
fully. The result is a coexistence of both strains in the hos-
pital and maintenance of CA-MRSA because of the large 
inﬂ ux of colonized and infected patients.
This ﬁ nding is consistent with the biology of the 2 
strains, which suggests differential ﬁ tness on the basis of 
the size of SCCmec. In CA-MRSA strains, the predominant 
SCCmec elements are types IV and V, which are small-
er than the SCCmec types typically found in HA-MRSA 
strains. These smaller genetic elements may increase the 
ﬁ tness of CA-MRSA strains outside hospital-related anti-
microbial drug pressures, presumably by increasing mo-
bility and growth potential (25). However, their increased 
susceptibility to antibacterial agents in the hospital leaves 
them at a ﬁ tness disadvantage. The result is that, although 
the community has effectively become a reservoir for the 
CA-MRSA strains that are continually introduced into the 
hospital population, without genetic changes, they are un-
likely to replace HA-MRSA strains in the hospital.
The large proportion of infections caused by CA-MR-
SA strains in hospitals with high frequencies of HA-MRSA 
has implications for drug-prescribing patterns within hos-
pitals. Because CA-MRSA strains are generally susceptible 
to more antimicrobial drugs, persons with these infections 
may be able to be treated with less expensive antimicrobial 
drugs with fewer adverse outcomes. Moreover, appropriate 
therapy can reduce the likelihood of emergence of other re-
sistant pathogens, such as vancomycin-resistant enterococ-
ci. Initial empiric therapy of infections with the suspected 
etiology of CA-MRSA must be tailored to antimicrobial 
drug susceptibility patterns within the local community and 
be based on efﬁ cacy studies that suggest speciﬁ c effective-
ness targets.
Kaplan suggested that empiric therapy should be mod-
iﬁ ed if >10%–15% of CA-MRSA isolates become resistant

physicians in determining appropriate empiric therapy. 
Strategies for prevention of infection and treatment of pa-
tients with CA-MRSA within healthcare settings should be 
coordinated primarily at the local level in accordance with 
local susceptibility proﬁ les. Lastly, infection control poli-
cies should take into account the role that outpatients likely 
play in the spread of MRSA and promote interventions that 
could prevent spread of MRSA from outpatient areas to in-
patient areas.

ology at Princeton University. His research interests include the 
ecology and epidemiology of resistance to antimicrobial drugs and 
policies to prevent the emergence and spread of drug resistance.

to a speciﬁ c empiric therapy (26). Conversely, it may be 
appropriate to reintroduce a speciﬁ c agent when suscepti-
bility levels increase above a threshold. However, cycling 
strategies may not always be optimal (27), and no efﬁ cacy 
studies have been conducted to establish this target. In ad-
dition, we urge caution in applying national results to the 
CA-MRSA antibiogram of a speciﬁ c area. Although results 
showed an overall trend at the national level, speciﬁ c re-
sults at individual testing centers tended to be more vari-
able. Moreover, local health ofﬁ cials and hospitals should 
coordinate their efforts to identify susceptibility patterns at 
the community level, rather than at the hospital level, to 
optimize the gains from investments in infection control 
(28).
The results of our study should be interpreted with cau-
tion because TSN provides information concerning only the 
site of isolate collection and not the infection. In addition, 
TSN only provides information on the collection location 
(i.e., outpatient or inpatient) and not case histories. Thus, 
some isolates may be difﬁ cult to classify in situations such 
as when an isolate was collected in the emergency depart-
ment and then the patient was admitted or the patient was 
discharged and then returned as an outpatient. However, 
the effect of these situations is likely to be small because 
most isolates are from patients who can be classiﬁ ed as in-
patients or outpatients.
A further limitation of the study is that although CA-
MRSA isolate drug susceptibility patterns are technically 
genetically determined, the data enabled only phenotypic 
classiﬁ cation of isolates. In addition, as with any large 
time-series database, changes in surveillance or bias in the 
types of infections cultured over time, such as more severe 
or unusual infections, could alter the results. These ﬁ ndings 
suggest that more complicated bacteriology could alter the 
results. However, no general trend in the number of isolates 
collected was seen at individual testing centers, and resis-
tance results from the TSN database were comparable to 
results of other national studies (1). Furthermore, the strik-
ing increases over the study period suggest that the trends 
are likely robust to any bias.
In summary, we examined the frequency of CA-MR-
SA and HA-MRSA in inpatient and outpatient settings. Our 
results indicate that outpatients may be a major reservoir of 
CA-MRSA, which will continue to enter hospitals, exac-
erbating the problem of MRSA. However, although CA-
MRSA isolates have undoubtedly spread within hospitals 
and are likely to continue to do so, without changes in the 
ﬁ tness of different strains, CA-MRSA strains are unlikely 
to displace HA-MRSA strains within the hospital.
Our ﬁ ndings have implications for local and national 
policies aimed at containing and preventing MRSA. More 
rapid diagnostic methods are urgently needed to better aid

To evaluate risk factors for infection with highly patho-
genic avian inﬂ uenza A virus (H5N1) in backyard chickens in 
Bangladesh, we conducted a matched case–control study. 
We enrolled 25 case farms (cases March–November 2007) 
and 75 control farms (June–November 2007). We used a 
questionnaire to collect farm data, which were analyzed by 
matched-pair analysis and multivariate conditional logistic 
regression. Factors independently associated were offer-
ing slaughter remnants of purchased chickens to backyard 
chickens (odds ratio [OR] 13.29, 95% conﬁ dence interval 
[CI] 1.34–131.98, p = 0.027), having a nearby water body 
(OR 5.27, 95% CI 1.24–22.34, p = 0.024), and having con-
tact with pigeons (OR 4.47, 95% CI 1.14–17.50, p = 0.032). 
Separating chickens and ducks at night was protective (OR 
0.06, 95% CI 0.01–0.45, p = 0.006). Reducing these risks 
and taking protective measures might reduce the risk for 
inﬂ uenza (H5N1) infection in backyard chickens.
H
ighly pathogenic avian inﬂ uenza (HPAI) A virus 
(H5N1) is a deadly zoonotic pathogen; from 1997 
through 2008, a total of 413 human cases were reported in 
15 countries, and 256 persons died (1). By March 2008, the 
virus had been identiﬁ ed in birds in 61 countries (2). The

persistence of the virus in poultry over a wide geographic 
area strengthens the hypothesis that a mutant virus might 
evolve and initiate a human pandemic. To reduce this 
threat, every country should have a surveillance system for 
detecting the virus in poultry, including backyard ﬂ ocks.
Worldwide, poultry production has recently undergone 
rapid change, including the introduction of intensive pro-
duction, new breeds, improved biosecurity, and preventive 
health measures. In developing countries, however, adop-
tion of this type of production has been limited because 
of the costs of infrastructures to maintain biosecurity for 
birds, quality hybrid chicks, balanced feed, biologics, and 
quality veterinary care (3). Up to 80% of the poultry in Af-
rica and Asia are kept in backyard-type systems (3,4), and 
these birds represent a substantial economic resource for 
impoverished rural populations.
In Bangladesh, ≈89% of rural households have back-
yard poultry (5), and many households keep chickens and 
ducks on the same property (6). In the absence of fences 
or other barriers, backyard chickens roam freely from one 
property to another. Because backyard chickens are reared 
in such free-range systems, they are more vulnerable to the 
HPAI (H5N1) virus infection; and, if they become infect-
ed, they can transmit the virus to domestic ducks, in which 
the virus can perpetuate (7–9) and infect more backyard 
chickens. This cycle of virus transmission between back-
yard chickens and ducks would continue until intercepted. 
HPAI (H5N1) virus in backyard chickens also poses a seri-
ous threat to public health because of the frequent and close 
contacts between poultry and humans. Little has been pub-
lished about the risk factors associated with HPAI (H5N1)

virus infection in backyard chickens in any parts of the 
world, and to our knowledge, nothing has been published 
about the risk factors in Bangladesh. Because understand-
ing the risk factors for the virus in backyard chickens and 
preventive measures might slow or prevent the spread of 
the virus, we conducted a case-control study to determine 
the risk factors for HPAI (H5N1) virus infection in back-
yard chickens in Bangladesh.
Materials and Methods
ers in the village who had reared village chickens for >1 
year. These 10 names with distinct numbers were used as 
the sample frame for the village. From the sample frame 
of the ﬁ rst selected village, we randomly chose 2 backyard 
farm owners who had adult chickens (>6 months of age) 
and chicks (<1 month of age) and whose chickens had not 
died during the clinical phase of HPAI on the case farm. 
Likewise, 1 backyard farm owner was selected from the 
sample of the second village. To ﬁ nd control farms with 
Sonali or Fayoumi chickens, the same (1–10 km) zone of 
selection was used, but the names of the farm owners were 
drawn from the local upazila (a lower administrative unit in 
Bangladesh) veterinary ofﬁ ce and used as the sample from 
which to randomly select 3 farms. Because biologics were 
scarce, serologic testing to conﬁ rm the noninfected status 
of the control farms was not attempted.
Global positioning system coordinates from the case 
and control farms were collected during farm visits and en-
tered into a digitized map of Bangladesh. A geographic in-
formation system program (Arc View 9.1; Environmental 
System Research Institute, Redlands, CA, USA) was used 
(Figure).
Data Collection and Survey Method
A questionnaire designed for this study was pretested 
at 5 case farms. The questionnaire was then modiﬁ ed ac-
cording to new variables encountered during pretesting. In 
the ﬁ nal questionnaire, 59 variables were surveyed (spread-
sheet available from P.K.B.). The questionnaire was then 
administered on the case and control farms by 2 veterinar-
ians trained to administer questionnaires; they interviewed 
farm owners or, if owners were absent, any adult family 
members. Variables collected addressed geographic loca-
tion, stock information, ﬂ ock health history, and overall 
farm management. All interviews were conducted in Ben-
gali, the only spoken language in the study area, during 
June–November 2007.
Study Population and Case Deﬁ nition
Bangladesh is composed of 4,500 unions (local gov-
ernment units that comprise several villages) and 90,500 
villages (10). Of the total poultry population in the country 
(≈222 million birds), 50% are backyard poultry, predomi-
nantly indigenous (nondescriptive) chickens and mostly 
reared in free-range systems on the homesteads in these 
villages (10). In Bangladesh, villagers sometime rear Fay-
oumi and Sonali (a cross-bred F1 generation of Fayoumi 
[female] and Rhode Island Red [male]) chickens in a semi-
scavenging system (11–13) and occasionally in intensive 
systems. All 25 HPAI outbreaks recorded in indigenous (n 
= 20 farms), Fayoumi (n = 2), and Sonali (n = 5) chick-
ens in village areas in Bangladesh by November 17, 2007, 
were considered outbreaks in backyard chickens, and the 
farms were enrolled in our study as case backyard farms. 
By date of onset of clinical signs, the ﬁ rst outbreak of HPAI 
in backyard chickens was recorded on March 22, 2007, the 
date on which Bangladesh was ofﬁ cially declared HPAI 
(H5N1) virus infected. In 2007, the numbers of backyard 
farms infected were 1 farm in March, 3 in April, 7 in May, 
7 in June, 2 in July, 1 in September, 3 in October, and 1 in 
November.
A case backyard farm was deﬁ ned as one that had 
a high chicken mortality rate and on which inﬂ uenza vi-
rus A subtype H5 was detected from tracheal samples 
of 2 chickens by reverse transcription–PCR (RT-PCR) 
using a primer set hemagglutinin (HA) oligo 5′ (5′-
ACACATGCYCARGACATACT-3′) and HA oligo 3′ 
(5′-CTYTGRTTYAGTGTTGATGT-3′), as described by 
Lee et al. (14). Testing was done at the National Refer-
ence Laboratory for Avian Inﬂ uenza in Bangladesh. Case 
reporting of HPAI (H5N1) in chickens in Bangladesh and 
detailed laboratory diagnosis, including diagnostic recon-
ﬁ rmation from the Veterinary Laboratory Agency in the 
United Kingdom, has been described (15).
For each case farm, we selected and enrolled 3 control 
backyard farms, each of which was within 1–10 km of a 
case farm. Each unaffected village in this zone of selec-
tion was assigned a unique number, and 2 were randomly 
selected by lottery. One villager from each selected village 
was asked to give 10 names of the backyard farm own-
Statistical Analysis
The collected data were entered into a spread sheet 
program (Excel; Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA) and 
transferred into Epi Info 2000 (Centers for Disease Con-
trol and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA) for analysis. To 
estimate the strength and statistical signiﬁ cance of associa-
tions between risk factors and HPAI (H5N1) virus infec-
tion, we used the Mantel-Haenszel matched-pair analysis 
(McNemar) test. An association was considered signiﬁ cant 
if 2-sided tests of signiﬁ cance had a p value <0.05. To ex-
amine independence of effects, we conducted multivariate 
conditional logistic regression using the conditional logis-
tic regression (CLogit) function in Stata 9.0 for Windows 
(Stata Corp., College Station, TX, USA). Any variables 
with p<0.2 after matched-pair analysis were included in

HPAI in Backyard Chickens, Bangladesh
backyard chickens (within 21 days of the onset clinical 
signs in case farms) had the strongest point estimate of ef-
fect (matched odds ratio [OR] 22.1) and high statistical sig-
niﬁ cance (p<0.001) despite wide 95% conﬁ dence intervals 
(CIs) of 2.7–177.7. Other factors positively associated with 
case farms were migratory birds around a farm (OR 7.5, 
95% CI 1.5–38.7, p = 0.010), rodents on the farm (OR 5.8, 
95% CI 2.0–16.8, p = 0.001), contact with pigeons (OR 5.5, 
95% CI 1.9–16.0, p = 0.001), and a nearby body of water 
(OR 3.7, 95% CI 1.5–9.5, p = 0.004). Protective factors 
(OR <1) for case backyard farms were placing chickens 
and ducks in different shelters at night (OR 0.1, 95% CI 
0.1–0.5, p = 0.001) and having a commercial farm within 
0.5 km (OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.1–0.9, p = 0.028).

Multivariate Analysis
Eight variables with p<0.2 were considered for inclu-
sion in the conditional logistic regression model to estimate 
independence of effects (Table 2). The ﬁ nal conditional lo-
gistic regression model identiﬁ ed 3 variables as indepen-
dent risk factors for HPAI (H5N1) infection of backyard 
chickens in Bangladesh (Table 3). They were 1) offering 
slaughter remnants of purchased chickens to backyard 
chickens (within 21 days of the clinical onset of the dis-
ease) (OR 13.29, 95% CI 1.34–131.98), 2) having nearby 
body of water (OR 5.27, 95% CI 1.24–22.34), and 3) hav-
ing contact with pigeons (OR 4.47, 95% CI 1.14–17.50).

chickens and ducks in different shelters at night (OR 0.06

strategy was used to construct a ﬁ nal model with a signiﬁ -
cance level of p<0.05.
Results
Population Statistics
Indigenous, Fayoumi, and Sonali chickens were raised 
on 20, 2, and 3 backyard farms, respectively. Median num-
ber (and range) of indigenous chickens was 24 (3–88) on 
case farms and 14 (5–50) on control farms and of Fayoumi/
Sonali chickens was 950 (125–1,970) on case farms and 
2,200 (1,500–3,500) on control farms. Chickens of various 
ages (mean 35.7 weeks [range 3.5–130]) were raised on 10 
of the case farms, but precise ages of chickens on 15 case 
farms were not provided by the owners; 6 said they had 
only adult chickens, and 9 said they had adult chickens and 
young chicks. Adult and young indigenous chickens were 
raised on the 60 control farms.
Discussion
We used analytic epidemiologic techniques to un-
veil the possible risk factors associated with inﬂ uenza 
(H5N1) infection for backyard chickens in Bangladesh so 
that effective risk management can be advocated. A few 
published reports quantify the risk factors for inﬂ uenza 
(H5N1) infections in commercial chickens (16,17), but to 
our knowledge, analytic epidemiologic reports quantifying 
risk factors for backyard chickens are few, if any. The re-
sults of this study should contribute to the understanding of 
risk factors associated with inﬂ uenza (H5N1) infections in 
backyard chickens in other developing countries, particu-
larly in southern Asia.
Although only 1 case of inﬂ uenza (H5N1) in a human 
has been reported in Bangladesh, the country’s poultry sec-
tor has been severely affected; by July 2009, a total of 325 
outbreaks had been reported in chickens, 51 of which were 
in backyard chickens (www.moﬂ .gov.bd/daily_birdﬂ u_re-
port.pdf). Because of limited manpower, the country re-
lies predominantly on passive surveillance to detect HPAI 
outbreaks in chickens. Thus, the possibility of unreported 
cases occurring in backyard chickens in some parts of the

country cannot be ruled out. These hidden and unreported 
infections in backyard chickens can help perpetuate the 
virus, posing a serious challenge to eradication efforts. 
Strengthening active instead of passive surveillance and 
generating awareness at the rural level of risk factors for 
the HPAI (H5N1) virus infection in backyard chickens, 
and their management, might help reduce the virus load in 
poultry in the country.
Stalls with live poultry can be found at virtually every 
kitchen or village market in Bangladesh. At the local mar-
kets, villagers can sell their poultry to local persons or to 
poultry vendors, who buy poultry in bulk to sell at larger 
city markets. When villagers fear a disease outbreak, they 
start selling apparently healthy and even clinically diseased 
chickens. Diseased chickens are cheaper, encouraging other 
villagers to buy them for meat. They purchase live chickens 
and slaughter them at home. They then offer the slaugh-
ter remnants, inedible for humans, to their own backyard 
chickens, which scavenge and forage around the slaughter 
places. Such practice occurred at 8 (32%) case farms <21 
days of the onset of the clinical signs (Table 1); this prac-
tice appears to be strongest risk factor for HPAI (H5N1) 
infection in backyard chickens in Bangladesh.
Another risk factor was domestic ducks, which are 
considered a “Trojan horse” for the HPAI (H5N1) virus 
(7–9). Their main feed sources are vegetation, small ﬁ sh, 
amphibians, snails, oysters, and other crustaceans, found in 
and around water. The water bodies and their banks might 
become contaminated with the HPAI (H5N1) virus by vi-
rus-shedding ducks that congregate at these places. Back-
yard chickens might be exposed to the virus while sharing 
the same banks near the body of water, which could explain 
why a nearby body water appeared to be an independent 
risk factor.
The inﬂ uence of 2 kinds of bodies of water on the 
HPAI outbreaks in backyard chickens was assessed by in-

corporating 2 variables: 1) presence of a nearby (<0.1 km) 
body of water and 2) distance <0.5 km from a larger body 
of water. The latter variable was meant for any larger wa-
ter-logged paddy or open ﬁ eld, lagoon, marsh, river, lake, 
or canal where water and migratory birds live or take ref-
uge. These bodies of water are sometimes shared by do-
mestic ducks; but generally, ducks on backyard farms feed 
on nearby bodies of water, predominantly ponds made by 
the birds’ owners for household purposes or aquaculture. 
Secondarily, ducks roam in these ponds to collect feed. 
Presence of a larger body of water within 0.5 km of a back-
yard farm seems to have no causal association with the oc-
currence of HPAI in backyard chickens in Bangladesh, but 
the presence of a nearby pond might.
In 1997, domestic pigeons (Columbia spp.) were 
largely resistant to infection with an HPAI (H5N1) virus 
isolated from Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, 
People’s Republic of China (18); other studies showed that 
they appeared to be more resistant to infection than many 
other avian species (19,20). In Bangladesh, many backyard 
farmers rear chickens, ducks, pigeons, and sometimes other 
poultry in groups of mixed ages. Domestic pigeons are a 
major source of meat in Bangladesh, and not 1 pigeon in 
the country has been reported dead of inﬂ uenza (H5N1) 
infection. The risk factor of contact with pigeons included 
2 categories: the owners’ own domestic pigeons and neigh-
bors’ visiting pigeons. In a complex of backyard farms in 
Bangladesh, pigeons are allowed to feed with other farm 
poultry; in addition, pigeons of 1 backyard farm frequently 
visit others for additional feed. Oronasal secretions and fe-
ces from sick, or dead, backyard chickens with HPAI, have 
a high virus titer, thereby polluting the farm. Pigeons’ feed-
ing and behavior probably allows them to come in close 
contact with the secretions of the infected or dead chick-
ens or with fomites, enabling them to transmit the virus 
mechanically. Nettles et al. (21) reported that pigeons and 
some wild birds—crows, mourning doves, vultures, and 
others—are not responsible for dissemination of inﬂ uenza 
virus (H5N2) among poultry farms. However, in contrast 
to the ﬁ ndings of Nettles et al. (21), dead crows in different 
areas of Bangladesh were found to be positive for inﬂ uenza 
virus (H5) (neuraminidase was not determined) (22). Be-
cause of the lack of evidence of mechanical transmission of 
inﬂ uenza virus (H5N1) through pigeons in backyard chick-
ens, the hypothesis that they are mechanical transmitters 
of inﬂ uenza virus (H5N1) under the prevailing conditions 
of backyard chicken farms in Bangladesh cannot be con-
ﬁ rmed without a thorough virologic study.
Some owners also offer supplementary feeds, predom-
inantly cereals or their byproducts, to their chickens and 
ducks, usually in the evening when they are placed in the 
night shelters to protect them from predators. No domestic 
duck in Bangladesh has been reported dead of inﬂ uenza vi-
rus (H5N1) infection. Placing chickens and ducks in sepa-
rate night shelters appeared to be a protective factor. On the 
contrary, an association with inﬂ uenza (H5N1) was found 
with rearing them on the same farm.
In developing countries, including Bangladesh, bios-
ecurity enhancement, according to the Food and Agricul-
ture Organization of the United Nations, poultry produc-
tion system 4 is impossible to adopt. However, practical 
ways to minimize the risk factors identiﬁ ed in this study 
are possible in these countries, as follows. Chickens must 
not be fed remnants of slaughtered chickens that have been 
purchased from markets or mobile poultry vendors, and 
inedible portions thus produced must be disposed of hy-
gienically. Villagers should not buy any obviously or ap-
parently sick chickens, although they are cheaper, because 
these birds pose a serious threat to the villagers’ health and 
to the health of their backyard chickens. Enactment of laws 
with punitive measures for selling clinically sick chick-
ens anywhere in the country and strict implementation of 
these laws are vital for limiting the spread of the virus from 
live bird markets to backyard chickens and vice versa. In-
dividual backyard farm owners should be encouraged to 
rear only chickens or ducks; but if that is impractical, the 
owners should be advised to construct separate night shel-
ters for ducks and chickens. Chickens should be limited or 
prevented from scavenging along the banks of bodies of 
water. During feeding, a family member can prevent pi-
geons from joining the ﬂ ock; any remaining feed must be 
removed carefully.
Because backyard chickens are a vital economic re-
source in Bangladesh, backyard farmers cannot be pre-
vented from rearing them. Therefore, avoidance of the risk 
factors identiﬁ ed in this study, and implementation of pro-
tective factors, might reduce the risk for inﬂ uenza (H5N1) 
infection in backyard chickens in the country.

 Landscape Epidemiology of 
Tularemia Outbreaks in Sweden 
Kerstin Svensson, Erik Bäck, Henrik Eliasson, Lennart Berglund, Malin Granberg, Linda Karlsson, 
Pär Larsson, Mats Forsman, and Anders Johansson
Summer outbreaks of tularemia that occurred from 
1995 through 2005 in 2 locations in Sweden affected 441 
persons. We performed an epidemiologic investigation of 
these outbreaks using a novel strategy, involving high-reso-
lution genotyping of Francisella tularensis isolates obtained 
from 136 patients (using 18 genetic markers developed from 
6 F. tularensis genome sequences) and interviews with the 
patients. Strong spatial associations were found between F. 
tularensis subpopulations and the places of disease trans-
mission; infection by some subpopulations occurred within 
areas as small as 2 km2, indicating unidentiﬁ ed environmen-
tal point sources of tularemia. In both locations, disease 
clusters were associated with recreational areas beside 
water, and genetic subpopulations were present throughout 
the tularemia season and persisted over years. High-reso-
lution genotyping in combination with patients’ statements 
about geographic places of disease transmission provided 
valuable indications of likely sources of infection and the 
causal genotypes during these tularemia outbreaks.  
T
raditional objectives of investigations of infectious 
disease outbreaks are to identify ways to control ongo-
ing outbreaks and to prevent future outbreaks. However, 
a paucity of epidemiologic and ecologic knowledge ham-
pers the investigation of tularemia outbreaks caused by the 
intracellular bacterium Francisella tularensis, although it 
is one of the most virulent pathogens known. The Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention lists this pathogen as

one of the most potentially dangerous bioterrorism bacteria 
(1). Little is known about natural reservoirs of tularemia, 
F. tularensis transmission mechanisms to humans, and fac-
tors inﬂ uencing the often irregular pattern of outbreaks. 
Because tularemia is a zoonosis and little ecologic infor-
mation exists about the causal organism, its prevention and 
control may require the development of novel outbreak in-
vestigation strategies.
In nature, F. tularensis is associated with an extremely 
wide range of hosts and arthropod vectors; a recent review 
listed 304 susceptible species (2). Transmission to humans 
may occur through a number of routes; skin inoculation by 
blood-feeding arthropod vectors is one of the most com-
mon routes (3). The infectious dose can be as low as 10 
bacterial cells (4). Human tularemia naturally occurs only 
in biotopes in the Northern Hemisphere. We describe an 
investigation of a large number of F. tularensis isolates 
from humans. Patients were infected mainly from mosquito 
bites and had an inﬂ uenza-like illness, a primary skin ulcer, 
and enlargement of lymph nodes, the ulceroglandular form 
of tularemia (5,6). Tularemia is endemic in Sweden, with 
seasonal outbreaks and a patchy geographic distribution. 
The number of infected humans ranged from 27 to 698 per 
year from 1998 through 2007 in a population of ≈9.1 mil-
lion (annual incidence rate 0.30–7.78/100,000 persons) (7). 
For comparison, 20–64 humans were reported with tula-
remia from 2000 through 2006 in the tularemia-endemic 
US states of Arkansas and Missouri, from a population of 
≈8.3 million (annual incidence rate 0.23–0.76/100,000 per-
sons) (8). F. tularensis subsp. holarctica causes tularemia 
all over the Northern Hemisphere. This is a severe febrile 
disease but does not generally result in death. A more viru-
lent variety, F. tularensis subsp. tularensis, exists in North 
America. It was associated with a human mortality rate of 
5%–15% before the advent of effective antimicrobial drug

treatments (4). F. tularensis has a clonal genetic structure, 
a property that should facilitate tracking the spread of tula-
remia by genotyping (9,10).
We demonstrate a strategy to enhance epidemiologic 
investigations of tularemia by combining geographic data 
collected from patient interviews and high-resolution geno-
typing of F. tularensis subsp. holarctica isolates recovered 
from tularemia patients. We found that geographic distri-
butions of speciﬁ c F. tularensis subsp. holarctica subpopu-
lations were highly localized during outbreaks (infections 
by some genotypes were restricted to areas as small as 2 
km2), indicating distinct point sources of infection.
Materials and Methods
Figure 1. Locations of the 2 tularemia outbreak areas in Sweden, 
showing Ljusdal and Örebro 364 km apart.
Study Locations
We studied tularemia, which must be reported under 
Swedish law, in 2 locations 364 km apart: the Municipality 
of Ljusdal and the County of Örebro (19,384 and 273,956 
inhabitants, respectively, in 2005) (11) (Figure 1). The hu-
man tularemia incidence rates in Ljusdal and Örebro cited 
here were based on the annual number of human tularemia 
cases reported to the County Medical Ofﬁ cer for Commu-
nicable Diseases. Tularemia has been endemic for several 
decades in Ljusdal with repeated outbreaks (12), whereas 
in Örebro, incidence of tularemia has been low since the 
disease was ﬁ rst reported in Sweden in the 1930s (5). From 
1990 through 1999, Örebro reported only 8 cases.
Study Period, Isolate Information, 
and Preparation of DNA
From 1995 through 2005, clinicians in Ljusdal and Öre-
bro sent patient specimens for tularemia serologic analysis, 
F. tularensis culture, and PCR detection to the laboratories 
at the Swedish Defense Research Agency, Umeå, Sweden; 
Umeå University Hospital, Umeå; or Örebro University 
Hospital, Örebro. Culture and PCR diagnostics of ulcer 
specimens were performed as described elsewhere (13). 
Blood culture was performed by using the instrumented 
BD Bactec Plus system (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, 
NJ, USA). All Francisella culture work was performed un-
der BioSafety level 3 laboratory conditions. A tube agglu-
tination test or an ELISA measuring immunoglobulin (Ig) 
M and IgG was used for serologic analysis, as previously 
described (14). For DNA preparation, F. tularensis isolates 
were recultured, then a loopful of bacteria was suspended 
in phosphate-buffered saline and heat-killed, and a chaotro-
pic salt method was applied (6).
elsewhere, we previously identiﬁ ed 280 insertion/deletion 
(INDEL) and variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) 
markers by multiple alignments of the Francisella ge-
nomes U112, FSC147, SCHU S4, OSU18, and LVS (15). 
For the current study, we selected 20 of these 280 markers 
(17 INDELs and 3 VNTRs) that were polymorphic among 
F. tularensis subsp. holarctica isolates from Europe and 
North America. We then added 11 VNTR markers showing 
polymorphism among subsp. holarctica isolates of world-
wide origin, and 1 INDEL (Ft-M19) shown to be speciﬁ c to 
subsp. holarctica (9). Finally, we added 2 single nucleotide 
polymorphism (SNP) markers identiﬁ ed in a comparative 
BLAST analysis (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) 
of F. tularensis subsp. holarctica genomes of a worldwide 
origin including FSC200 (human, Ljusdal, 1998), LVS, 
RC530, FSC022, FTA, OR96-0246, and OSU18. The 2 
SNP markers were selected to be phylogenetically informa-
tive while lacking homoplasy among 67 Francisella strains 
of diverse origin. Collectively, the selection process yield-
ed a set of 34 genetic markers that were applied to 48 of 
the 136 study isolates (24 each from Örebro and Ljusdal). 
Markers found to be polymorphic among the 48 selected 
isolates were ﬁ nally used to genotype all 136 isolates.
Identiﬁ cation and Selection of Markers
We used 3 types of genetic markers to provide high-
typing resolution and robust categorization of F. tularensis 
subsp. holarctica into genetic subpopulations. As described

 Tularemia Outbreaks in Sweden
DNA Fragment Analysis and Real-time PCR SNP Assay
DNA fragment analysis of INDELs and VNTRs were 
performed on a Genetic Analysis System CEQ 8800 (Beck-
man Coulter Inc., Fullerton, CA, USA) machine, as previ-
ously described (15). Genomic positions for SNPs and their 
corresponding PCR ampliﬁ cation primers are presented in 
Table 1. The SNP states were determined by real-time PCR 
by using a set of 2 forward primers with different single 
nucleotide extensions at the 3′ end, and a common reverse 
primer (16). We could read the SNP state by a differential 
PCR ampliﬁ cation efﬁ ciency.
of disease transmission and to self-estimate the spatial data 
quality on a 3-category scale. A pair of RT-90 cartographic 
coordinates (19) was then assigned to each patient and the 
corresponding F. tularensis subsp. holarctica isolate, speci-
fying the locations of ﬁ rst-choice place of transmission with 
the highest self-estimated quality. RT 90 is a standardized 
2-dimensional Swedish map reference coordinate system. 
For patients who indicated multiple places of infection with 
identical data quality estimates, the coordinates of the place 
closest to the spatial mean center of tularemia in Ljusdal 
or Örebro were used (online Appendix Table 1, available 
from 
www.cdc.gov/EID/content/15/12/1937-appT1.htm, 
and online Appendix Table 2, available from www.cdc.
gov/EID/content/15/12/1937-appT2.htm). If no geographic 
information was available for a patient, the residential ad-
dress was used.
We visualized and analyzed geographic and genotype 
data by using ArcView software in ArcGIS version 9.3 
(ESRI, Redlands, CA, USA), and calculated spatial mean 
centers of disease occurrence (the average x and y values for 
the input coordinates) for all genetic groups and subgroups 
of isolates. The directional trend was examined by using 
the directional distribution tool in ArcGIS Spatial Statistics 
Tools (ESRI) and an ellipse size of 1 standard deviation.
Genetic Groups, Subgroups, and Cluster Analysis
We assigned isolates to genotypes by using the binary 
character output for each INDEL marker, the repeat copy 
number at each VNTR marker, and the results of the SNP 
assay. We analyzed the associations among genotypes 
by their degree of genetic character sharing by using the 
eBURST algorithm (17). Genetic groups were deﬁ ned as 
genotypes sharing 16 of 18 characters and subgroups shar-
ing 17 of 18 characters. In addition, the genetic associations 
between the isolates were assessed by cluster analysis by 
using the unweighted pair group m with arithmetic mean 
(18) algorithm implemented in BioNumerics version 5.1 
(Applied Maths NV, Sint-Martens-Latem, Belgium) using 
the categorical coefﬁ cient.
Results
Descriptive Epidemiology
We isolated F. tularensis from 136 of 441 patients with 
laboratory-veriﬁ ed tularemia in the Municipality of Ljusdal 
during 1995–2005 (n = 56) and in the County of Örebro 
during 2000–2004 (n = 80). This ﬁ nding constituted 34% 
(56/163) and 29% (80/278) of all patients with laborato-
ry-veriﬁ ed tularemia during the outbreak years in Ljusdal 
(1995, 1998, 2002, 2005) and Örebro (2000, 2002–2004), 
respectively (Figure 1).
Analysis per outbreak year showed that the number of 
patients with culture-veriﬁ ed tularemia were proportional 
Patient Interviews and Geographic Mapping
To obtain geographic data on likely places of disease 
transmission in Ljusdal, all patients in whom F. tularen-
sis subsp. holarctica was diagnosed from 1995 through 
2005 completed a questionnaire distributed during 2007 
and marked on an accompanying map the location of the 
site where they believed they had been infected. In Öre-
bro, patients admitted to hospital with tularemia from 2000 
through 2004 were interviewed on admission, interviewed 
by telephone, or issued questionnaires, as previously de-
scribed (5). All patients were asked for alternative places

of isolates (Figure 5). Only 1 genotype was represented in 
both study locations; an isolate from Ljusdal obtained in 
2005 was identical to an isolate from Örebro in 2003 (see 
genotype ID 9; Figure 5). In both study locations, genetic 
subgroups and genotypes were present throughout a tulare-
mia season and persisted over years (Figures 5, 6).
Phylogeographic Analysis in Ljusdal
The F. tularensis isolates recovered from 1995 through 
2005 from patients in Ljusdal were genetically monomor-
phic. The 53 of 56 isolates that belonged to genetic sub-
to the total number of tularemia patients. The ages of pa-
tients from whom positive cultures were obtained ranged 
from 1 to 90 years, distributed evenly among age groups: 
20%, 18%, 34%, and 28% in persons 0–20, 21–40, 41–60, 
and >60 years of age, respectively, with a male:female ra-
tio of 1.2:1 (online Appendix Tables 1, 2). No apparent 
correlations were found between genotypes and either the 
gender or age of the patients. The annual incidence rates 
of tularemia were 21–423 per 100,000 persons in the Mu-
nicipality of Ljusdal and 12–55 per 100,000 persons in the 
County of Örebro in outbreak years, but disease-free years 
were interspersed between outbreaks. Generally, tularemia 
patients reported that they were infected at places used for 
outdoor activities, e.g., on walking paths, at bathing places, 
at golf courses, or in an allotment garden (parcels of land 
for cultivation) assigned to individuals or families (Figures 
2–4; online Technical Appendix, available from www.cdc.
gov/EID/content/15/12/1937-Techapp.pdf). A statement of 
a likely arthropod transmission vector was available for pa-
tients from Örebro; indicating mosquitoes (n = 101), ticks 
(4), horse ﬂ ies (8), mosquitoes or ticks (2), mosquitoes or 
horse ﬂ ies (19); 144 patients reported not knowing (the vec-
tors reported by the 80 patients with culture-veriﬁ ed tula-
remia are listed in online Appendix Table 2). A presumed 
place of tularemia acquisition was pinpointed by 120 (88%) 
of 136 of patients and self-estimates of the quality of spatial 
data were available for 44 of 56 patients in Ljusdal and 76 
of 80 patients in Örebro (online Appendix Tables 1, 2) with 
culture-veriﬁ ed tularemia. Overall, patients felt conﬁ dent 
about where they had acquired tularemia; 92 of 136 patients 
indicated that their place of disease acquisition was certain 
or probable (Table 2).

River in Ljusdal. Reported places of disease transmission and

tularensis isolates belong to genetic group 1e and are of genotype 
ID 15 (red) or genotype ID 16 (black). Place of disease transmission 
was reported to be certain (circle), probable (square), or possible 
(diamond); patient residency was used when transmission data 
was unavailable (triangle). 
Genetic Analysis of Outbreak Isolates
We ﬁ rst identiﬁ ed 34 genetic markers that were poly-
morphic among F. tularensis subsp. holarctica isolates of 
worldwide origin. Among these, 18 markers (6/14 VNTRs, 
10/18 INDELs, and both SNPs) were polymorphic among 
the 136 study isolates. Seven of these polymorphic markers 
have not been previously described (Table 1); 11 (Ftind30–
34, Ftind37, Ft-M3, Ft-M6, Ft-M20, Ft-M22, Ft-M24) 
have been previously published (9,15). By applying the 18-
marker system to the 136 isolates, we identiﬁ ed 19 geno-
types. The 136 isolates were assigned to 3 genetic groups 
(denoted 1, 2, and 3) corresponding to previously described 
genetic groups (9,15,20) and 5 subgroups (denoted 1a–e), 
on the basis of their degree of character sharing (Figure 5). 
Most isolates from Ljusdal (55/56) and Örebro (68/80) be-
longed to genetic group 1. In pairwise comparisons, genetic 
groups 1, 2, and 3 differed at 6–13 of the 18 characters. A 
mutation at marker Ft-SNP2 was distinctive to the large ge-
netic subgroup 1e from Ljusdal (53 isolates). Cluster analy-
sis based on a distance matrix showed an identical grouping

restricted, spanning an elliptic area of only 16 km2. Seven 
of 12 transmission locations of genetic subgroup 1a could 
alternatively be enclosed in a rectangular area of just 2 km2

only 3 isolates with 3 distinct genotypes; places of disease 
transmission spanned a distance of 58 km (not shown).
In total, 240 of 278 patients in Örebro reported places 
of tularemia transmission. A spatial distribution plot of the 
locations reported by 202 of these patients is shown in Fig-
ure 3 (those of 38 patients are not shown because they were 
outside the map area), indicating the existence of 4 tulare-
mia transmission clusters. Two clusters are further detailed 
in Figure 4. Eighty-three patients reportedly acquired tula-
remia in the Oset/Rynningeviken nature reserve 2 km from 
Örebro City center. Twenty-six of 27 cultured F. tularensis 
isolates from this area belonged to genetic group 1. Seven-
teen patients reported transmission at Lake Lången, 5 km 
north of Örebro City. Here, multiple patient reports veriﬁ ed 
that bacteria of genetic groups 1d and 2 coexisted. How-
ever, the centers of occurrence were geographically distinct 
(Figure 8, panel A).
Discussion
In this study of natural outbreaks of human tularemia 
in 2 locations in Sweden, genetic techniques developed for 
high-resolution typing of F. tularensis were used in con-
group 1e were circumscribed by a 150-km2 ellipse (Figure 
7, panel A). All 56 isolates were circumscribed by a 230-
km2 ellipse. Analysis per outbreak year showed that the 
infection area of 1e isolates was stable, with an east–west 
distribution along the river Ljusnan (Figure 7). The places 
of disease transmission for 3 isolates of genetic subgroups 
1b, 1c, and 3 were peripheral to the infection area of 1e iso-
lates (Figure 7, panel D). Many patients reported acquiring 
tularemia from restricted geographic areas, e.g., 33 of 56 
isolates were from a 25-km2 stretch along the river Ljusnan, 
with a disease cluster at a golf course (Figure 2).
Phylogeographic Analysis in Örebro
In Örebro, the places of disease transmission for ge-
netic groups 1 and 2 were within 2 partially overlapping 
geographic areas with distinctly separate mean centers of 
occurrence (Figure 8, panel A). Closer examination of the 
areas of genetic group 1 showed that those of subgroups 1a, 
1b, and 1d had similar spatial centers but different direc-
tional distributions (Figure 8, panels B–D). Infection loca-
tions of genetic subgroups 1a and 1b were oriented in an 
east-west direction along the Svartån River, whereas those 
of subgroup 1d were oriented in a north-south direction 
along the Lillån River. The places of disease transmission 
of genetic group 1 were circumscribed by a concatenated 
272-km2 ellipse area (Figure 8, panel A); those of genetic 
group 2 were circumscribed by a 645-km2 ellipse (Figure 
8, panel E). The proportions of isolates transmitted within 
the elliptic infection areas of genetic subgroups 1a, 1b, 1d, 
and 2 were 7 of 12, 9 of 16, 30 of 37, and 7 of 12, respec-

netic group 1 isolates in Örebro, which suggested recent 
expansion of local F. tularensis subsp. holarctica popu-
lations. The number of genotypes in genetic group 1 was 
notably greater than among genetic group 2 isolates from 
Örebro or among all the isolates recovered in the long-term 
tularemia-endemic area of Ljusdal (Figure 5). Because pre-
vious genotyping data have demonstrated that homoplastic 
SNP mutations are virtually nonexistent in F. tularensis 
(20,25), a common mutation at Ft-SNP1 (Figure 5) indi-
cates that the isolates in genetic subgroup 1d in Örebro and 
1e in Ljusdal share a more recent common ancestor than 
they do with isolates of subgroups 1a, 1b, or 1c in Örebro. 
However, genetic distances among all the group 1 isolates 
are likely to be small because Ft-SNP1 could be identi-
ﬁ ed only by comparison of complete genome sequences, 
including a genetic subgroup 1e genome (strain FSC200 
from Ljusdal) (26,27). Altogether, the data imply that ge-
netic groups 1a, 1b, and 1c isolates have a local evolution-
ary history rather than a recent local disease introduction 
(as veriﬁ ed by high genetic variation at VNTR markers) 
and that the 1d isolates appear genetically related with iso-
lates from Ljusdal (as veriﬁ ed by a SNP mutation). 
Restoration of a wetland area between 1993 and 2006 
(Figure 4) in Örebro may have been a factor in expansion 
of these genetic subgroups. Because F. tularensis subsp. 
holarctica is known to be associated with natural waters, 
favorable conditions for its replication may have resulted. 
The large genetic distance between genetic groups 1 and 2 
in Örebro (they are consistently distinct at 9 of 18 markers; 
Figure 5), where tularemia recently has reemerged, com-
pares with distances previously found among F. tularen-
sis subsp. holarctica isolates of worldwide origin (9) and 
excludes a recent local common origin. The existence of 
junction with information obtained from patient surveys 
and interviews to investigate the epidemiology and geo-
graphic spread of disease. Places of transmission of spe-
ciﬁ c F. tularensis genotypes (Figure 5) were highly local-
ized and restricted to areas as low as 2 km2, pinpointing 
likely point sources of infection (Figures 7, 8). The results 
demonstrate the capability of enhancing epidemiologic in-
vestigations of tularemia by combining data from patient 
interviews with high-resolution genotyping of F. tularensis 
isolates recovered from the same patients.
A recent study in Utah of 5 patients and 11 rabbit car-
casses infected with F. tularensis indicated that multiple 
F. tularensis subspecies and genetic subgroups may cause 
tularemia in a localized outbreak (21). Other studies have 
demonstrated that genetic subgroups of F. tularensis have 
distinct frequencies at continental scales throughout the 
Northern Hemisphere (20,22–24). Our study, in which 136 
F. tularensis subsp. holarctica isolates from 2 localized hu-
man outbreaks were examined, shows the phylogeographic 
structure in F. tularensis subsp. holarctica populations in-
volved in local outbreaks.
Why is there a phylogeographic structure? We found 
high genetic diversity and limited spatial distribution of ge-

 Tularemia Outbreaks in Sweden

week of disease onset was available for 84/87 patients in Ljusdal and 148/152 patients in Örebro.
several distinct F. tularensis populations active within a 
single tularemia outbreak is further demonstrated by com-
paring data of this study with data from previous work by 
Johansson et al. (9) and Kugeler et al. (24). All of the group 
1 isolates belong to clades named B1/B3 or B.Br.013/014, 
respectively in these previous publications; group 2 isolates 
belong to clade B4 or B.Br.007/008 (or a nearby clade), 
and group 3 isolates to clade B2 or B.Br.OSU18. Kugeler 
et al. demonstrated the large numbers of SNPs separating 
group 1 from groups 2 and 3 isolates, thus verifying very 
distinct genetic populations.
The geographically widely distributed genetic group 2 
in Örebro, the subgroup 1d in Örebro, or the subgroup 1e 
in Ljusdal, may be results of past temporary reductions of 
population sizes (genetic bottlenecks) or selective events 
(selective sweeps) that have eliminated genetic variation in 
originally more diverse populations. The selective sweep 
hypothesis is particularly attractive; a highly ﬁ t genotype 
over time will increase its frequency relative to other geno-
types and may occupy larger geographic areas. This scenar-
io would explain previous ﬁ ndings of low genetic diversity 
among isolates recovered from areas of Sweden with a long 
history of tularemia infections (9).
The genetic differences of genetic groups and sub-
groups were mirrored spatially. The genetic groups 1 and 2 
in Örebro showed distinct mean centers of occurrence (Fig-
ure 8, panel A), and genetic group 1d isolates were the only 
isolates of group 1 found along the whole stretch of the 
river Lillån, resulting in a distribution area oriented north-
south, opposite to subgroups 1a and 1b, which showed an 
east-west direction of their distribution areas (Figure 8, 
panels B–D). Similar pattern of separated disease occur-
rence center for genetic groups were found in Ljusdal (Fig-
ure 7, panel D). Collectively, these observations indicate 
distinct replication foci and dispersal areas of different F. 
tularensis subsp. holarctica populations.

Many reasons are likely for a clustering of human tula-
remia. First, tularemia occurrence depends on the number 
of persons at risk, i.e., those who visit or live in areas where 
F. tularensis foci exists (Figures 2, 3). Second is the effect 
of vector ecology. Most of the 134 (91%) patients in Örebro 
who speciﬁ ed a disease transmission vector reported it to 
be mosquitoes. Thus, the distance that mosquitoes disperse, 
200–2,000 m for most species in Sweden (28,29), probably 
strongly inﬂ uences the infection patterns. Third, local fac-
tors affect the persistence and distribution of F. tularen-
sis in nature. We found identical genotypes over different 
years, indicating that tularemia overwinters at the disease 
cluster sites. Genetic groups also were present during the 
whole tularemia season from July to September, indicating 
that no particular temporal patterns were associated with 
speciﬁ c bacterial genotypes (Figures 5, 6).
Although uneven distributions of persons at risk and 
transmission vectors, as well as a general association of 
tularemia with streaming waters, may explain geographic 
disease clustering in humans, only different spatial distri-
butions of F. tularensis populations can explain cluster-
ing of genetic groups and subgroups. Our observations are 
consistent with Pavlovsky’s theory of “natural nidality of 
transmissible diseases,” i.e., a connection of the vector-
borne disease with a deﬁ nite geographic landscape (30). In 
the case of tularemia, a recent study on dog ticks carry-

time in Ljusdal sometimes was up to 12 years; in Örebro 
patients were approached at admission to hospital. It is our 
impression, however, from many patient interviews, that 
the short incubation time of tularemia (2–5 days), the dis-
tinct clinical expression, its occurrence in restricted geo-
graphic areas, and a transmission route by blood-feeding 
arthropods, did facilitate patient recalls.
Ljusdal and Örebro in Sweden have comparatively 
high tularemia incidence rates. The results of this study 
suggest that genotyping coupled with global imaging satel-
ing F. tularensis subsp. tularensis on Martha’s Vineyard 
(Massachusetts, USA) showed persistence in a microfocus 
in nature over 4 years (31). Supporting the existence of a 
landscape epidemiology of tularemia, we found that differ-
ent F. tularensis subsp. holarctica populations are locally 
present near certain bodies of water where they apparently 
stably perpetuate.
A major limitation of this study is a retrospective de-
sign that may have caused recall bias regarding the loca-
tions at which tularemia was contracted. The patient recall

lite mapping can help identify local environmental sourc-
es of tularemia, which is essential for effective infection 
control. This study also shows that pathogen genome se-
quencing efforts can contribute to the design of genotyping 
schemes tailored to a speciﬁ c outbreak investigation. By 
combining high-resolution genotyping with patient inter-
views, we found F. tularensis populations to have strong 
spatial associations in 2 localized tularemia outbreaks. In 
future investigations, we believe that application of parallel 
mass-sequencing technologies to F. tularensis will be high-
ly valuable for identifying additional genetic markers that, 
in turn, will facilitate tracking of the zoonotic pathogen 
through environmental sources, blood-feeding arthropods, 
and mammals. In addition to a more detailed genetic analy-
sis, we need to identify ecologic correlates to the local areas 
of F. tularensis persistence and replication. Ultimately, the 
goal is to gain knowledge enabling future focused interven-
tions directed at reducing the risk for tularemia acquisition 
by humans visiting or living in areas in which tularemia is 
highly endemic.

Delineating Anaplasma 
phagocytophilum Ecotypes in 
Coexisting, Discrete Enzootic Cycles

and Richard J. Birtles
The emerging tick-borne pathogen Anaplasma phago-
cytophilum is under increasing scrutiny for the existence of 
subpopulations that are adapted to different natural cycles. 
Here, we characterized the diversity of A. phagocytophilum 
genotypes circulating in a natural system that includes mul-
tiple hosts and at least 2 tick species, Ixodes ricinus and the 
small mammal specialist I. trianguliceps. We encountered 
numerous genotypes, but only 1 in rodents, with the remain-
der limited to deer and host-seeking I. ricinus ticks. The ab-
sence of the rodent-associated genotype from host-seeking 
I. ricinus ticks was notable because we demonstrated that 
rodents fed a large proportion of the I. ricinus larval popula-
tion and that these larvae were abundant when infections 
caused by the rodent-associated genotype were prevalent. 
These observations are consistent with the conclusion that 
genotypically distinct subpopulations of A. phagocytophilum 
are restricted to coexisting but separate enzootic cycles and 
suggest that this restriction may result from speciﬁ c vector 
compatibility.
T
he tick-transmitted bacterium Anaplasma phagocyto-
philum is the causative agent of granulocytic anaplas-
mosis, an infection of medical and veterinary importance 
that is widely encountered across the temperate zones of 
the Northern Hemisphere (1–3). Although considerable ef-
fort has been put into determining the natural diversity of A. 
phagocytophilum (4–6), our understanding of ecologic and 
evolutionary processes that underlie this diversity remains 
far from complete. A. phagocytophilum has been detected 
in the blood of a wide range of mammals and in several

different Ixodes species, which suggests that it is a general-
ist parasite with the capacity to exploit multiple hosts and 
vectors (1–3,5–9). However, evidence for the existence of 
subpopulations that are adapted to speciﬁ c reservoir host 
species has recently been forthcoming (7,9,10), and these 
subpopulations appear to possess differing potential to be 
a public health threat (7,9,10). This phenomenon has also 
been described within another tick-borne generalist species 
complex, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (11) and, more 
recently, within the 1 generalist member of this complex, 
B. burgdorferi sensu strictu (12,13). As yet, no evidence 
has shown that subpopulations of either A. phagocytophi-
lum or B. burgdorferi have adapted to different Ixodes spe-
cies as vectors.
Knowledge of the existence of host- or vector-adapted 
subpopulations is important given the public health con-
sequences of multivector transmission by these pathogens. 
For example, we and other researchers (14–19) have hy-
pothesized that pathogen populations maintained in ef-
ﬁ cient tick-rodent cycles by nidicolous (nest-living and 
host-specialist) ticks, such as I. trianguliceps in the Unit-
ed Kingdom and I. spinipalpis and I. minor in the United 
States, could spill over into the human population due to 
the co-occurrence of sympatric exophilic (and human-bit-
ing) tick species such as I. ricinus in the United Kingdom 
and I. paciﬁ cus and I. scapularis in the United States.
The purpose of this study was to characterize the di-
versity of A. phagocytophilum strains circulating in a natu-
ral multihost, multivector system and to determine whether 
the observed diversity had any ecologic basis. We obtained 
compelling evidence to support the proposition that differ-
ent subpopulations of A. phagocytophilum exploit different 
tick and mammal species and, as a result, occur in discrete 
enzootic cycles even though both vectors and hosts are 
sympatric.

Delineating A. phagocytophilum Ecotypes
Materials and Methods
Natural Multihost, Multivector Study System
Kielder Forest is a managed plantation forest domi-
nated by Sitka and Norway spruce that covers 620 km2 
in northern England (55°13′N, 2°33′W). The harvesting 
of timber generates clearcut areas of 5–12 ha, which are 
subsequently replanted and progress through grassland 
and the thicket stage after 12–15 years. The most abundant 
mammal species encountered within clearcut areas is the 
ﬁ eld vole (Microtus agrestis), which exhibits multiannual 
population cycles in which densities can reach >700/ha 
(20). Roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) are also abundant at 
an estimated density of 3 deer/km2 across the forest and are 
frequent visitors to clearcut areas (21). The presence of I. 
ricinus and I. trianguliceps ticks in clearcut areas has been 
documented (18,19).
Monitoring of A. phagocytophilum Genotypes
Crude nucleic acid extracts were prepared from blood 
samples and host-seeking I. ricinus nymphs as previously 
described (11). The presence of A. phagocytophilum DNA 
in each extract was assessed by a real-time PCR (25).
Genotyping of A. phagocytophilum strains exploited 
sequence variation at 3 genetic loci, 16S rDNA, msp4, and 
DOV1. Fragments of msp4 and 16SrDNA were ampliﬁ ed 
and analyzed as described (18,25). DOV1 is a noncoding 
region of ≈275 bp lying immediately downstream of a pre-
viously described variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) 
locus (6). Ampliﬁ cation of this locus was achieved by using 
seminested PCR. The ﬁ rst round of ampliﬁ cation contained 
10 ρmol of each of the primers DOV1f (5′-GAT CTA TGA 
ATT GCY RGT GTT ATA-3′) and DOV1r1 (5′-ACA TTG 
TCA ATT TCT CAC CAT-3′), 12.5 μL of 2× Master Mix 
(Abgene, Epsom, UK), 1 μL of nucleic acid extract and 
sterile H2O to a ﬁ nal volume of 25 μL, which was subjected 
to a thermal program of 95°C for 3 min, then 35 cycles 
of 95°C for 10 s, 58°C for 10 s, and 72°C for 50 s, then a 
ﬁ nal extension step of 72°C for 5 min. The second round 
of ampliﬁ cation incorporated 1 μL of ﬁ rst-round product 
into a reaction containing 10 ρmol of each of the primers 
DOV1f and DOV1r2 (5′-CAA YRC ACR YAC ATT TCT 
AGG A-3′), 22.5 μL of Reddymix (ABgene), made up to 
a ﬁ nal volume of a 25 μL with sterile H2O. This reaction 
mix was subjected to the same thermal program as used for 
the ﬁ rst round of ampliﬁ cation. DOV1 amplicons were se-
quenced directly by using the second round primers. DNA 
sequences from all 3 loci studied were veriﬁ ed, assembled 
and aligned by using Chromas Pro (Technelysium Pty Ltd, 
Tewantin, Queensland, Australia) and MEGA4 software 
(26). Sequence similarity calculations and phylogenetic in-
ferences were conducted by using MEGA4 software (26).

Monitoring of Host and Vector Populations
Protocols for the handling and sampling of wild rodents 
were approved by the University of Liverpool Committee 
on Research Ethics and were conducted in compliance 
with the terms and conditions of licenses awarded under 
the UK Government Animals (Scientiﬁ c Procedures) Act, 
1986. Voles were trapped at 4-week intervals from March 
2004 through November 2005 (excepting December 2004 
and February 2005) at 4 principal study sites that were 3.5 
km–12 km apart. Each animal captured was processed as 
described previously and a blood sample was taken from 
the tail tip (19). Voles were examined for ticks, with all 
larvae being removed and stored in 70% ethanol for iden-
tiﬁ cation (22,23) before releasing the animal at the point 
of capture. Nymph and adult ticks were not removed to 
minimize any effect on the transmission of tick-borne in-
fections, which were being studied as part of an extensive 
longitudinal program. Host-seeking I. ricinus nymphs and 
adults were collected at monthly intervals from the princi-
pal study sites from March 2004 through September 2005 
as previously described (19) and from 17 additional sites 
widely distributed across the Kielder Forest District. Col-
lected ticks were stored and identiﬁ ed as described above. 
Roe deer blood samples were collected from January 2004 
through July 2006 from animals culled throughout the for-
est and stored in EDTA-containing tubes at –20°C.
Host Bloodmeal Source Identiﬁ cation
The relative importance of different species as hosts 
for I. ricinus larvae was determined as previously described 
(24). Probes for the following taxa were used: Myodes spp., 
Apodemus spp., Microtus agrestis, Sciurus spp., Sorex 
araneus, Meles meles, and C. capreolus, together with a 
generic bird probe (24).
Monitoring of Host and Vector Populations
A total of 2,926 blood samples from 1,503 voles at 
the 4 study sites was obtained. Similar numbers of voles 
were encountered at each site and the population size at 
all sites ﬂ uctuated in a broadly synchronous manner, in 
keeping with the well-documented seasonal and multian-
nual population cycles (27). A. phagocytophilum DNA was 
detected in 183 (6.3%) of the blood samples, representing 
157 (10.4%) of individual animals tested. Except for the 
bacterium being seemingly absent from 1 site in 2004, the 
seasonal variation in prevalence of infection was similar at 
all sites, with infections disappearing over winter, before 
reappearing in the spring and persisting until late autumn 
(Figure 1, panel A).
Of the 3,378 ticks that were recorded on the sur-
veyed voles, 83.6% (2,823) were larvae, 13.4% (454) were

ging. The seasonal dynamics of both life stages have been 
presented elsewhere (19). A. phagocytophilum DNA was de-
tected in 30 of 4,256 nymphs tested (0.7%), 9 of 263 adult 
females (3.4%) and 8 of 321 adult males (2.5%). Infected 
nymphs were encountered at 10 different sites. Infected host-
seeking nymphs were collected during the same dragging 
session on only 8 occasions, suggesting that, for the most 
part, infected nymphs had fed on different animals.
Host Bloodmeal Source Identiﬁ cation
Bloodmeal source identiﬁ cation was attempted on 399 
host-seeking I. ricinus nymphs and unambiguous results 
were obtained for 105 ticks (26.3%). These ticks were ob-
tained from dragging sessions throughout 2004 (87 ticks) 
and 2005 (18 ticks) from the 4 principal study sites. Sixty-
two (59.0%) showed evidence of having fed on voles as 
larvae, 18 (17.1%) fed on birds, 15 (14.3%) fed on deer, 
and the remaining 10 (9.5%) fed on small mammal species 
other than ﬁ eld voles.

binomial 95% conﬁ dence intervals (A) or SEM (B).
Monitoring of A. phagocytophilum Genotypes
Comparison of partial 16S rDNA sequences ob-
tained from 5 infected voles and 5 infected deer showed 
4 highly similar (>99%) sequence types. All voles were 
infected with a sequence type that was identical to one 
previously associated with various ruminant species (e.g., 
Old Sourhope, GenBank AY176591). Three 16S rDNA se-
quence types were obtained from the deer samples, 2 of 
which had been previously reported associated with a vari-
ety of animals and tick species across the Northern Hemi-
sphere (e.g., GenBank AF481850 and AJ242783), but the 
third sequence type was new. Although comparison of 16S 
rDNA sequence types was useful in conﬁ rming that detect-
ed DNAs were derived from strains of A. phagocytophilum, 
the insensitivity of this locus for intraspecies delineation 
led us to attempt sequence typing on the basis of a more 
variable locus, msp4 (6,28).

nymphs, and 2.9% (101) adults. Approximately equal 
numbers of I. ricinus (1,618, 57.3%) and I. trianguliceps 
(1,205, 42.7%) were identiﬁ ed among the larvae, the sea-
sonal dynamics of which are shown in Figure 1, panel B. I. 
ricinus larvae were most abundant in late spring/early sum-
mer, whereas I. trianguliceps larvae were most abundant in 
late autumn. The dramatic spike in the number of I. ricinus 
larvae recorded in May 2005 resulted from a small number 
of voles at one of our principal study sites having an ex-
tremely high number of larvae. Although nymph and adult 
ticks were not removed from voles (so could not be identi-
ﬁ ed to species), their numbers were recorded. Of relevance 
to this study, virtually no nymphs or adults were observed 
on voles between November and April (Figure 1, panel B). 
The absence of the life stages that are capable transmitters 
of A. phagocytophilum underlies the disappearance of in-
fections in voles during winter.
Blood samples were collected from 279 roe deer and 
A. phagocytophilum DNA was detected in 132 (47.3%) 
of these samples. Infections were detected throughout the 
year, with infection prevalence consistently high during the 
late spring/early summer of the years surveyed (Figure 2).
In total, 4,984 nymphs, 680 adult males, and 656 adult 
female host-seeking I. ricinus ticks were collected by drag-

Figure 3. Phylogenetic tree inferred from alignment of Anaplasma 
phagocytophilum msp4 sequences obtained in this study or available 
from GenBank. Inference was made by using the neighbor-joining 
algorithm. The stability of proposed branching order was assessed 
by bootstrapping (1,000 replicates). At nodes present in >50% 
of replicates, the percentage of replicates possessing the node 
is indicated. The GenBank accession numbers of the new msp4 
sequences obtained during this study (in boldface) are included 
in the strain designations. rAP sequence types were detected in 
questing Ixodes ricinus ticks and roe deer, and the tAP sequence 
type was detected in voles. Scale bar indicates nucleotide 
substitutions per site.
Unambiguous sequence data were obtained from am-
plicons derived from 45 infected roe deer, 48 infected voles, 
and 21 infected host-seeking I. ricinus nymphs and adults. 
For each host or vector, the samples came from across the 
range of sites, seasons and years of study. Seven msp4 se-
quence types were obtained from infected roe deer. One 
sequence type was detected in most (30) samples. This and 
a second sequence type had previously been encountered 
among European deer, while the 5 remaining sequence 
types were new. Four msp4 sequence types were encoun-
tered among the infected host-seeking I. ricinus ticks, all 
of which were also detected in roe deer. The most com-
monly encountered sequence type, which infected 17 ticks, 
was the same as that found most frequently among infected 
deer. The partial msp4 sequences obtained from 48 infected 
ﬁ eld voles were all indistinguishable from one another. 
Phylogenetic analysis, based on an alignment of the 
50 A. phagocytophilum msp4 sequence types present in 
GenBank (as of August 1, 2008), the 6 new alleles re-
ported in this study, and homologous sequences avail-
able for the closely related species A. marginale and A. 
centrale, was used to infer the relative evolutionary po-
sitions of the A. phagocytophilum strains encountered in 
this study. The 5 new sequence types obtained from roe 
deer and host-seeking I. ricinus ticks lay within a cluster 
of closely related sequence types that also included the 2 
other sequence types recovered from roe deer and I. rici-
nus ticks that had been previously encountered elsewhere 
(Figure 3). This well-supported cluster comprised 50 of 
the 53 A. phagocytophilum msp4 sequence types report-
ed to date and was characterized by short intersequence 
type evolutionary distances and included strains associ-
ated with wild and domesticated ruminants, companion 
animals, and humans. 
Three A. phagocytophilum sequence types lay outside 
this cluster (Figure 3) and included types speciﬁ cally asso-
ciated with voles in this study, one associated with Chinese 
rodents (ZJ-China) (8), and one obtained from an infected 
roe deer in Germany (“roe deer”) (5). The evolutionary 
distances between these 3 sequence types were markedly 
longer than those between the sequence types within the 
large cluster, and although maximum parsimony analysis 
indicated a shared line of descent for the vole-associated 
and roe deer–associated sequence types, this branching 
order was not strongly supported when distance matrix– 
or minimum evolution–based methods of inference were 
used, and no approach suggested a clustering of either of 
these sequence types with ZJ-China.
Examination of DOV1 sequences supported the msp4-
based analysis. Unambiguous DOV1 sequences were ob-
tained from DNA extracts derived from 8 infected deer, 6 
infected ﬁ eld voles, and 14 host-seeking I. ricinus ticks. A 
total of 13 different DOV1 sequence types were obtained; 
all infected voles yielded the same sequence type, whereas 
infected deer yielded 5 different sequence types, and infect-
ed host-seeking ticks yielded 9 different sequence types. 
Two sequence types were associated with both deer- and 
host-seeking I. ricinus ticks. Phylogenetic analysis inferred 
that DOV1 sequence types associated with deer and host-
seeking I. ricinus ticks were closely related to one another, 
whereas sequence types associated with voles had mark-
edly diverged (Figure 4). This phylogeny is congruent with 
that derived from msp4 data.

we encountered with the provenance of the characterized 
strains. Our efforts have resulted in the discovery that ﬁ eld 
voles serve as a reservoir host for a unique genotype of the 
species that has markedly diverged from those genotypes 
encountered in wild roe deer and host-seeking I. ricinus 
nymphs and adults. This discovery is incompatible with the 
hypothesis that voles, I. ricinus ticks, and roe deer are all 
part of the same enzootic cycle but instead provides com-
pelling evidence for at least two co-existing yet distinct en-
zootic cycles, one involving roe deer as hosts and I. ricinus 
ticks as vectors and another with ﬁ eld voles as hosts. As 
we have previously reported, A. phagocytophilum can be 
maintained in the absence of I. ricinus ticks in a natural 
cycle involving small mammals and I. trianguliceps ticks 
(32), and that, even when present in abundance, I. ricinus 
ticks do not play a major role in this cycle (19). I. triangu-
liceps ticks, which occur abundantly in our study system, 
are almost certainly a component of the enzootic cycle that 
includes ﬁ eld voles.
The results of our study are not compatible with the 
hypothesis that pathogen populations maintained in an en-
zootic rodent–nidicolous tick cycle could spill over into 
humans or livestock because of the co-occurrence of sym-
patric exophilic tick species (14–19). Through the use of 
host bloodmeal source identiﬁ cation, we demonstrated that 
I. ricinus larvae had ample opportunity to acquire A. phago-
cytophilum infection from voles (over half the questing I. 
ricinus nymphs we tested fed on voles as larvae). However, 
we found no evidence of the vole-associated genotype in 
host-seeking I. ricinus nymphs. This result suggests that, I. 
ricinus larvae are, at best, inefﬁ cient vectors of the vole-
associated A. phagocytophilum genotype, thereby osten-
sibly removing the potential “bridge” out of the enzootic 
cycle that includes voles and I. trianguliceps. Notably, we 
did not detect deer/I. ricinus tick–associated A. phagocyto-
philum genotypes in voles despite previously observing I. 
ricinus nymphs feeding on these hosts (25). Because we did 
not remove nymph or adult ticks infesting our surveyed ro-
dents in this study, we were unable to distinguish between 
I. ricinus and I. trianguliceps ticks, so were unable to gauge 
the frequency with which the former were encountered, al-
though we believe that most nymphs on ﬁ eld voles are I. tri-
anguliceps (18). Thus, this absence may result either from 
voles not being susceptible to deer/I. ricinus–associated 
genotypes or simply because encounters between infected I. 
ricinus nymphs and voles occur only rarely.
Although vector specialization by arthropod-transmit-
ted pathogens is common (33), many of those that are tick-
transmitted exploit more than 1 species (15–19).Also, clear 
evidence exists for local adaptation, whereby pathogens 
exhibit greater infectivity in local vector populations than 
those that are geographically distinct (34,35), although this 
phenomenon was not encountered for A. phagocytophilum 
Discussion
Although considerable effort has been put into explor-
ing the genetic diversity of A. phagocytophilum (4–6), the 
public and veterinary health value of this endeavor has 
been limited by the failure to identify an ecologic basis for 
the genotypic variation encountered. Recent studies in the 
United States have begun to resolve this problem, with the 
identiﬁ cation of apparent host-preference ecotypes among 
different 16S rDNA sequence types of A. phagocytophi-
lum (7,9,10). One particular sequence type, referred to 
as Ap-variant 1, appears to exploit only white tailed deer 
(Odocoileus virginianus) as a reservoir host, whereas other 
variants, including that associated with human granulocytic 
anaplasmosis (Ap-ha), exploit white-footed mice (Pero-
myscus leucopus), a species that has long been implicated 
as a important reservoir for A. phagocytophilum in North 
America (29). In Europe, the epidemiology of A. phago-
cytophilum infections appears to be quite different from 
that in the United States. Although far fewer human cases 
have been reported, infections in livestock are common 
and represent a large ﬁ nancial burden to the industry (30). 
Surveys of strains infecting European livestock and wild-
living ungulates have found numerous 16S rDNA sequence 
types, including Ap-ha and Ap-variant 1 (6,31), indicating 
that this locus is not a marker of the same A. phagocyto-
philum ecotypes present in the USA. In this study we have 
begun to unravel the ecologic signiﬁ cance of the genetic 
diversity present among European A. phagocytophilum 
strains by genotyping strains circulating in a natural multi-
host, multi-vector system and correlating the genotypes

(36). We report evidence for the adaptation of different 
genotypes of the same pathogen species to transmission by 
different but co-existing vector species. We are planning 
laboratory transmission studies to determine the extent to 
which this adaptation represents complete specialization 
of genotype to vector. Nonetheless, the data we have al-
ready obtained from our ﬁ eld studies provide a clear insight 
into the ecologic consequences of this adaptation; in other 
words, of what is, rather than what may be, happening. A. 
phagocytophilum has a wide geographic distribution, and 
numerous members of the Ixodes genus have been impli-
cated in its transmission. Thus, plenty of scope remains for 
further exploration of vector speciﬁ city by subpopulations 
of the pathogen. The transmission of A. phagocytophilum 
in the laboratory has been reported (29) and, subsequently, 
efforts have been made to examine interstrain variation in 
the dynamics of this process (37). These include a demon-
stration that strains from the western United States that are 
naturally transmitted by I. paciﬁ cus ticks can be transmitted 
by I. scapularis ticks in the laboratory (35), which suggests 
that not all A. phagocytophilum strains have adapted to ex-
ploit only a single vector species. In addition, I. scapularis 
serves as a vector for both Ap-ha and Ap-variant 1, the 2 
A. phagocytophilum genotypes that possess different host 
speciﬁ cities (7,9,10). These observations, taken together 
with those made in the current study, provoke the conclu-
sion that although the species as a whole can be considered 
a generalist, A. phagocytophilum embraces a consortium of 
distinct ecotypes that have evolved a range of strategies to 
facilitate their own perpetuation. Whether host or vector 
specialization is the more commonly adopted strategy re-
mains to be explored.
From an infection control perspective, it is important 
to recognize that cryptic transmission cycles of tick-borne 
pathogens maintained by nidicolous ticks have substantial 
human and veterinary health risk implications when sym-
patric exophilic tick vectors act as a bridge to potentiate 
human or livestock infections. However, our study shows 
the value of a more profound understanding of the diver-
sity of the transmission cycles and pathogens on which 
to base estimation of the environmental health hazard: 
discrete co-existing transmission cycles can be associated 
with dilution of the abundance of tick-borne pathogens 
when, at ﬁ rst sight, an augmentation would be the expect-
ed outcome.

Calicivirus
[kə-lis′ ǐ-vi′′rəs]
The name of these members of the Caliciviridae family of nonenveloped RNA viruses reﬂ ects their structure. 
They are icosahedral with 32 typical surface depressions that are sometimes described as hollows or cups (from 
Latin calyx, meaning cup). Feline calicivirus, a member of the genus Vesivirus, causes respiratory disease in 
cats. Members of other genera, Norovirus and Sapovirus, cause gastrointestinal disease in humans.

Novel Calicivirus Identiﬁ ed in 
Rabbits, Michigan, USA
Ingrid L. Bergin, Annabel G. Wise, Steven R. Bolin, Thomas P. Mullaney, Matti Kiupel, 
and Roger K. Maes
We report a disease outbreak in a Michigan rabbitry 
of a rabbit calicivirus distinct from the foreign animal dis-
ease agent, rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV). The 
novel virus has been designated Michigan rabbit calicivirus 
(MRCV). Caliciviruses of the Lagovirus genus other than 
RHDV have not been described in US rabbit populations.  
The case-fatality rate was 32.5% (65/200). Clinical signs in-
cluded hemorrhage and sudden death, with hepatic necro-
sis. Analysis of viral RNA sequence from >95% of the viral 
genome showed an average similarity of 79% with RHDV. 
Similarity of the predicted MRCV capsid amino acid se-
quence ranged from 89.8% to 91.3%, much lower than the 
98% amino acid similarity between RHDV strains. Experi-
mentally infected rabbits lacked clinical disease, but MRCV 
was detected in tissues by PCR. We propose that MRCV 
primarily causes subclinical infection but may induce overt 
RHD-like disease under certain ﬁ eld conditions.
R
abbit hemorrhagic disease (RHD) is caused by a cali-
civirus and is associated with illness and death in up 
to 90%–100% of susceptible rabbit populations (1–3). 
Domestic rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculi) and free-ranging 
European rabbits (O. cunicuusi) are highly susceptible; 
cottontail rabbits (Sylvilagus ﬂ oridanus) and hares (Le-
pus spp.) are unaffected. Rabbit hemorrhagic disease vi-
rus (RHDV) was ﬁ rst detected in China in 1984 (4) and 
subsequently has been described in eastern and western 
Europe, Asia, South America, Australia, Mexico, and the 
United Kingdom (2,3). In the United States, it is considered

a foreign animal disease, and outbreaks are of considerable 
economic concern to the US rabbit industry. In the Unit-
ed States 4 outbreaks of RHD have occurred in domestic, 
captive rabbits (O. cuniculi) since 2000. These cases were 
conﬁ rmed by inoculation study and reverse transcription–
PCR (RT-PCR) because the virus is not cultivable in vitro. 
Subsequent genomic analyses suggested that these inci-
dences resulted from separate viral introductions; however, 
conﬁ rmed points of origin (e.g., imported animal or animal 
product) were never identiﬁ ed (3).
RHDV is classiﬁ ed as a Lagovirus within the family 
Caliciviridae. Caliciviridae are nonenveloped, positive- 
sense, single-strand RNA viruses. Within this family are 
4 genera: Lagovirus, Vesivirus, Norovirus, and Sapovirus 
(5). In addition to the highly pathogenic RHDV, the La-
govirus genus includes several distinct but related viruses 
affecting rabbits or hares. These are European Brown hare 
syndrome virus (EBHSV), which causes disease similar to 
RHDV in hares only (Lepus spp.) (6), and the nonpatho-
genic rabbit calicivirus (RCV), which causes asymptomatic 
seroconversion in rabbits (7). RCV and EBHSV have not 
been reported and lagoviruses other than RHDV have not 
been described in US rabbit populations, although a low 
pathogenicity rabbit Vesivirus recently was identiﬁ ed in 
domestic rabbits from Oregon (8). RHDV affects only rab-
bits of the Oryctolagus genus which, in the United States, 
is limited to domestic rabbit species. Wild rabbit species 
in the United States are not experimentally susceptible (9). 
Seroprevalence surveys of RHDV or related caliciviruses 
in US domestic rabbit populations have not, to our knowl-
edge, been published.
Beginning January 1, 2001, and continuing over a 
3-week period, a privately owned New Zealand White (O. 
cuniculi) rabbitry in Michigan experienced acute fatalities.

oligoprobe (5′-GAGAGTCGTCTCGGTAGTACCTG-3′, 
IDT, Coralville, IA, USA) at 5 μL/1 mL using a commer-
cial workstation (Fischer Scientiﬁ c, Pittsburgh, PA, USA). 
Detection was by antidigoxigenin (Boehringer Mannheim 
Biochemica, Indianapolis, IN, USA) conjugated with al-
kaline phosphatase (dilution 1:500, Boehringer Mannheim 
Biochemica) and the substrates NBT/X-Phos (nitro-blue 
tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate, Boeh-
ringer Mannheim Biochemica). A non-sense probe was ap-
plied to liver sections as negative control.
Before this episode, the farm had operated for 1.5 years 
without notable disease. Approximately 200 rabbits were 
kept in a closed barn on a 60-acre farm; new rabbits had 
not been acquired in 18 months. Inappetence in several 
animals and vulvar hemorrhage in pregnant does were ini-
tially noted. A total of 65 rabbits—consisting of 23 adult 
does (most pregnant), 2 adult bucks, and 41 young rabbits 
of both sexes—died over ≈3 weeks, for a case-fatality rate 
of 32.5%. Clinical signs consisted of vulvar hemorrhage 
in the does, epistaxis, ataxia, opisthotonos, diarrhea, ocular 
discharge, vocalization, and death.
Materials and Methods
Bacterial Cultures
Representative tissues from the original 3 does and 
14 subsequently submitted rabbits were cultured by using 
standard microbiologic techniques. Virus isolation was at-
tempted by injection of ﬁ ltered (0.45-μm pore size) 10% 
homogenate of liver (pooled from 2 of the originally sub-
mitted does) in Bovarnik’s buffer onto cultures of RK-13, 
R9ab, or SIRC cells.
Biological Samples
Three pregnant does (2 live) with vulvar hemorrhage 
were submitted for diagnostic evaluation on January 3. 
Eighteen additional rabbits of either sex ranging from 2 
through 9 months of age were submitted near the end of the 
disease outbreak on January 17 and February 2. Animals 
submitted live were humanely euthanized by intravenous 
or intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital (Fatal-Plus, 
Vortech, Dearborn, MI, USA) at 1 mL per 10 pounds.
Tissue samples from representative organs of all sub-
mitted rabbits were immersion ﬁ xed in 10% neutral buff-
ered formalin. We processed tissue samples for histopa-
thology using standard methods. Transmission electron 
microscopy was performed on a negatively stained clariﬁ ed 
pooled liver homogenate from 2 of the originally submitted 
does using standard procedures.
For immunohistochemistry, liver sections from an af-
fected rabbit were deparafﬁ nized and rehydrated by routine 
methods. Antigen retrieval was by proteinase K (Dako, 
Carpinteria, CA, USA) for 10 min at 37°C. Endogenous per-
oxidase was blocked for 15 min with 3% hydrogen perox-
ide, and nonspeciﬁ c immunoglobulin binding was blocked 
by 10 min incubation with a protein-blocking agent (Dako). 
Guinea pig anti-RHDV VP60 antibody (dilution 1:1,000) 
provided by Dr. F. Parra (10) was applied for 30 min at 
room temperature in a Dako autostainer. After incubation 
with rabbit anti–guinea pig immunoglobulin (Ig) G, detec-
tion was by a chain polymer conjugated staining procedure 
(EnVision, Dako) with visualization by AEC (Dako) and 
Mayer’s hematoxylin counterstaining. Negative controls 
were homologous (guinea pig) nonimmune serum applied 
to rabbit liver sections.
Nucleic Acid Extraction and PCR
Total RNA from pooled liver of 2 initially submit-
ted does was extracted with RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN, 
Inc., Valencia, CA, USA), according to the manufacturer’s 
guidelines. A 398-bp region of the VP60 (capsid) gene was 
initially targeted using RHDV-speciﬁ c primers (12). RT-
PCR was performed on total liver RNA using a One-Step 
RT-PCR Kit (QIAGEN) with forward and reverse prim-
ers, 5′-GTT ACG ACT GTG CAG GCC TAT GAG TT-3′ 
and 5′-TTG TTG AGC AGT CCA ATT GTC ACT G-3′, 
respectively, at 0.6 μM in a 50-μL reaction. Cycling condi-
tions were as follows: cDNA synthesis at 50°C for 30 min; 
then predenaturation at 95°C for 15 min and 43 cycles of 
94°C for 30 sec, 55°C for 30 sec, and 72°C for 1 min; and 
ﬁ nal extension of 72°C for 10 min. Products were visual-
ized in prestained agarose gels by a UV transillumination. 
The entire capsid gene (≈1.8 kb) was ampliﬁ ed by using 
primers based on USA Iowa 2000 RHDV strain (spanning 
nucleotide positions 5273–7065, GenBank accession no. 
AF258618). Forward and reverse primers, 5′-CGG TAG 
TAC CTG ACG ACG AAT TTG-3′ and 5′-GCA AGT CCC 
AGT CCG ATG AAT-3′, respectively, were used as above, 
with the modiﬁ cation of 35 cycles with 2 min of extension. 
Further genomic sequencing used primers from conserved 
RHDV and Michigan rabbit calicivirus (MRCV)–derived 
sequences (Table) with annealing temperatures 52°C–55°C 
and extension times 1 min per 1-kb target length. MRCV 
genomic ends were sequenced using 5′ and 3′ RACE Sys-
tems for Rapid Ampliﬁ cation of cDNA Ends (Invitrogen, 
Carlsbad, CA, USA). For 5′ RACE, cDNA was synthe-
sized with gene-speciﬁ c primer, GSP1, 5′-ACT GTA CTC 
CCT GGG TGC GAC-3′ (MRCV, 2039–2059, minus 
sense) with puriﬁ cation and dCTP-tailing with TdT. The 
In Situ Hybridization
In situ hybridization was performed as described (11). 
Brieﬂ y, liver sections from an affected and an experimental 
rabbit were deparafﬁ nized, digested with 0.25% pepsin and 
prehybridized. Hybridization was for 5 min at 105°C and 
60 min at 37°C with a speciﬁ c 3′-end digoxigenin-labeled

Sequencing and Sequence Analyses
RT-PCR amplicons were puriﬁ ed from 1.4% agarose 
gels by QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (QIAGEN). PCR 
products were sequenced by the Research Technology Sup-
port Facility of Michigan State University by automated 
DNA sequencing on an ABI Prism 3100 Genetic Analyzer 
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Long PCR 
templates were sequenced by using primer-walking with 
newly synthesized 5′ and 3′ primers derived with OLIGO 
6 primer analysis software (Molecular Biology Insights, 
Cascade, CO, USA). Similar GenBank sequences were 
detected by BLAST analysis (13). Sequence assembly and 
analyses, including multiple Clustal W  (www.ebi.ac.uk/
clustalw) sequence alignments and construction of phylog-
eny trees, were done with Lasergene software (DNASTAR, 
Inc., Madison, WI, USA). GenBank accession numbers for

Inoculation Study
Fourteen 16-week-old male and female, speciﬁ c 
pathogen–free New Zealand White rabbits (Harlan Sprague 
Dawley, Inc., Indianapolis, IN, USA) were each inoculated 
intramuscularly, orally, and intranasally with 2 mL total 
of liver homogenate containing 104–105 PCR detectable 
units of viral RNA per mL, as determined by PCR assay 
on serial 10-fold dilutions of RNA extracted from the in-
oculum. Homogenate was prepared from frozen (−80ºC) 
liver from 2 of the originally submitted does. Two control 
rabbits were in containment housing in the same cage bank 
but not in direct contact with inoculated rabbits and were 
not sham inoculated. The rabbits were free of Pasteurella 
multocida, Bordetella bronchiseptica, Encephalitozoon cu-
niculi, Treponema cuniculi, Clostridium piliforme, myxo-
matosis virus, RHDV, Toxoplasma spp., and coccidiosis. 
Animal husbandry was in keeping with the Animal Welfare 
Act and US Public Health Service policy, and the infec-
tion study protocol was approved by the University Animal 
Care and Use Committee.
Rabbits were monitored for clinical changes and were 
humanely euthanatized by intravenous pentobarbital injec-
tion after 2 (n = 2 control rabbits), 4 (n = 2), or 7 (n = 12) 
days of infection. Complete necropsies were performed 
and tissue samples harvested for histology, serology, and 
RT-PCR. The MRCV capsid encoding region was cloned 
into a baculovirus expression vector by standard meth-
ods, enabling serologic testing by application of serum to

Results 
Immunohistochemistry and In Situ Hybridization
RHDV was immunohistochemically detected within 
the cytoplasm of approximately 20% of hepatocytes in 1 
of the initially submitted does, primarily in the periportal 
and midzonal areas (Figure 5). MRCV nucleic acid was de-
tected by in situ hybridization in scattered hepatocytes and 
few Kupffer cells (Figure 6).
Capsid Ampliﬁ cation
Using primers targeting the RHDV capsid gene (VP60), 
we detected a 398-bp amplicon by RT-PCR on pooled liver 
samples from 2 originally submitted does. BLAST analy-
sis (13) of a unique 344-bp sequence (excluding primer 
sequences) showed average 79% similarity to GenBank 
RHDV capsid sequences. This unique sequence translates 
into 113 amino acids with 86.8% similarity to the partial 
capsid protein in a representative strain of RHDV (FRG, 
GenBank NC_001543). For comparison, RHDV capsid se-
quences typically have 98% identity with one another (7). 
Gross and Histologic Findings
The animals submitted for diagnostic evaluation were 
in good body condition. Several had conjunctival conges-
tion (Figure 1) and mild cyanosis of the lips and ear tips 
before euthanasia. The pregnant does had small amounts of 
vulvar hemorrhage and cutaneous hyperemia. The gravid 
uteri in the does had red to purple serosal discoloration 
with serosanguinous luminal ﬂ uid. Fetuses were in good 
condition and appeared normal. The livers of all does and 
2 of the young adult rabbits were friable and tan and had 
accentuated lobular pattern (Figure 2). Individual rabbits 
variably exhibited icterus, opisthotonos, gastric petechiae 
and ecchymoses (Figure 3), colonic serosal hemorrhage, 
and multifocal hemorrhage in caudal lung lobes.
In the 3 initially submitted does, the major histologic 
ﬁ nding was multifocal random or periportal hepatocellular 
necrosis (Figure 4). Additionally, we found mild periportal 
heterophilic (neutrophilic) and lymphoplasmacytic inﬂ am-
mation. There were also pulmonary and uterine hemor-
rhages with ﬁ brin clots in areas of placental implantation. 
In the 18 subsequently submitted young adult rabbits, pre-
dominant histologic ﬁ ndings were moderate expansion of 
portal tracts with bile duct proliferation, periductal ﬁ brosis, 
and mild periportal lymphoplasmacytic inﬂ ammation. Five 
rabbits had concurrent heterophilic and bronchopneumo-
nia, and 1 had suppurative meningitis.

Initial Diagnostic Testing
Caliciviral-like particles were detected in pooled liv-
er homogenate from 2 of the originally affected does by 
transmission electron microscopy. On request, the US De-
partment of Agriculture Foreign Animal Disease Diagnos-
tic Laboratory further tested tissue samples. Results from 
inoculation testing and RT-PCR using standard primers 
(3) within the RHDV polymerase region at FADDL were 
not consistent with RHD, and RHDV was ruled out as the 
cause of the outbreak.
Uterine cultures from 1 of the initially submitted does 
grew >1,000 colony-forming units (CFU)/mL P. multoci-
da. One young adult rabbit with hepatic necrosis and con-
current bronchopneumonia grew >1,000 CFU/mL P. mul-
tocida from the lung. Two other rabbits had smaller CFU/
mL (<100) P. multocida and B. bronchiseptica from the 
lung. Three animals grew low CFU/mL Escherichia coli 
(<100) from the liver. Virus isolation was not successful. 
Anticoagulants were not detected within liver samples, and 
no organic toxins were detected by gas chromatography/
mass spectrometry.

genome was further characterized.

Multiple Sequence Alignment and 
Phylogenetic Analysis
Because most phylogenetic comparisons of RHDV 
strains are based on capsid sequence, a dendrogram was 
generated on the basis of MRCV capsid amino acid se-
quence in comparison with multiple RHDV strains and with 
the outliers EBSHV and RCV (Figure 8). By this analysis, 
MRCV appears as an outlier to RHDV strains and is most 
closely related to the nonpathogenic RCV. MRCV capsid

Capsid and Genomic Sequencing and Analysis
Further ampliﬁ cation of the entire VP60 gene and up-
stream and downstream regions generated a genomic se-
quence of 7,387 nt, which is similar to the approximately 
7.4-kb length of RHDV (3). By alignment with other Lago-
virus sequences, this included all but 32 bases of the 5′ end 
of the ﬁ rst open reading frame (ORF) of the genome, which 
could not be sequenced despite multiple attempts. ORF 
analysis showed a large (2,328 amino acid) ORF-1 and a 
smaller (113 amino acid) ORF-2 that overlapped ORF-1 by 
8 nt (Figure 7). ORF-1 included conserved sequence motifs 
for nonstructural (helicases, proteases, and polymerases)

rate, novel caliciviral species.
Inoculation Study
We attempted to reproduce clinical signs of disease 
with an inoculation study. Clinical signs in inoculated rab-
bits were limited to decreased activity and inappetence in 
2 rabbits on day 4 postinoculation. These rabbits were eu-
thanized, and necropsy indicated they lacked gross or his-
tologic lesions. The other inoculated rabbits remained free 
of clinical disease through the end of the study and lacked 
gross postmortem lesions. Histologically there was rare, in-
dividual hepatocellular necrosis. Several tissues, including 
liver, spleen, stomach, jejunum, ileum, cecum, colon, and 
(in 3 rabbits) trachea/lung were positive for viral RNA by 
RT-PCR and in situ hybridization was positive in rare he-
patocytes within the liver (data not shown).
sequence alignments showed 91.7% similarity to RCV and 
89.8%–91.3% similarity to RHDV strains. In comparison, 
RHDV strains shared 95.0%-99.8% similarity with each 
other and 91.3%–92.7% with RCV. Because the capsid gene 
may be subject to recombination and positive selection, re-
latedness predicted solely on capsid sequence is prone to 
error (3). Further analysis compared nucleotide similarities 
of the ORF-1 polypeptide genomic sequence, excluding the 
capsid gene (Figure 9). RCV is excluded from this compari-
son because only capsid sequence is available (7). By this 
analysis, MRCV again appears as an outlier to RHDV, hav-
ing 77.9%–78.5% similarity to RHDV sequences, which 
share similarities of 87.8%–98.1% among themselves.
We undertook some additional comparisons of partic-
ular genomic regions. The amino acid sequence of MRCV 
polymerase was only 88.1% homologous to 4 representa-
tive RHDV strains, whereas polymerase is typically close 
to 100% conserved within viral species. Additionally, at 
the beginning of ORF-2, RHDV strains have 2 initiation 
codons, and RCV and EBHSV have only 1. MRCV ap-
pears to follow the pattern of RCV and EBHSV (Figure 
Depopulation and Necropsy Findings 
in Remaining Rabbits
Further disease in the affected rabbitry was not re-
ported after February 2, and disease outbreaks in additional 
rabbitries served by the same rabbit dealer were not identi-
ﬁ ed. For economic reasons, the owner of the premises de-
cided to depopulate the remaining rabbits ≈2 months later. 
Approximately 130 rabbits were submitted for euthanasia. 
Twenty-ﬁ ve animals had gross changes in their livers, con-
sisting of a granular capsular texture, ﬁ rm and collapsed 
tips of ventral lobes, and ﬁ rm parenchymal nodules up to 
2 cm in diameter (data not shown). Representative tissues 
from 4 animals were evaluated histologically. The liver 
showed moderate biliary hyperplasia and periductal to 
bridging portal-to-portal ﬁ brosis. Although these chronic 
alterations suggest previous liver insult, they are nonspe-
ciﬁ c with respect to cause.

bits (data not shown) but not in any of the experimentally 
inoculated rabbits that were euthanized as late as 7 days 
postinoculation.
On the basis of the percentage of affected animals in 
the outbreak and the failure to generate clinical disease in 
inoculated speciﬁ c pathogen–free (SPF) rabbits, MRCV 
appears likely to be of low pathogenicity, and clinically ev-
ident disease may depend on the health status, age, or indi-
vidual susceptibility of the host. RHDV is known to be most 
pathogenic in rabbits >8 weeks of age, possibly because 
of age-related differences in the expression of enterocyte 
receptors targeted by the virus (16–19). The symptomatic 
animals in this report were all >8 weeks of age. Many were 
pregnant does, and some had concurrent P. multocida infec-
tion. Although the inoculated rabbits were also >8 weeks of 
age, they were nonpregnant, commercially available SPF 
animals and lacked the apparently endemic P. multocida 
present in the diagnostic cases. RHDV-associated illness 
and death in laboratory rabbits can be lower than in ﬁ eld 
situations unless the animals are immune-primed by other 
disease agents (3,15). Alternately, the failure to reproduce 
disease may be due to low viable virus dose (difﬁ cult to 
assess for a noncultivable virus) or premature euthanasia 
of the inoculated rabbits. Although euthanasia by day 7 
was consistent with the anticipated timeframe for calici-
viral-induced disease, it may not have been sufﬁ cient if a 
low viral dose was used and was likely too early to expect 
seroconversion.
The phylogenetic analyses presented here indicate 
that MRCV is a distinct species from RHDV and the other 
known lagoviruses, RCV and EBHSV. MRCV is the ﬁ rst 
lagovirus other than RHDV detected in US rabbits; howev-
er, seropositivity to low or nonpathogenic caliciviruses has 
been demonstrated in rabbit populations in several other 
countries (7,19–21). Additional low pathogenicity strains 
may exist undetected in US rabbit populations. Samples 
to consider for RT-PCR detection of rabbit lagoviruses in-
clude liver, lung, spleen, and intestine. Although MRCV 
in this case was detected in liver, other low pathogenicity 
caliciviruses such as RCV replicate in intestine and may 
not be detected if liver is the sole sample evaluated (7). 
Infection with low or nonpathogenic lagoviruses in other 
countries has been postulated to mediate some protection 
against RHDV infection, although whether this is true of 
MRCV infection is unknown (20,21). As evidenced by this 
case study, diagnosticians faced with hemorrhagic disease 
Discussion 
In this study, a naturally occurring disease outbreak 
with clinical signs and pathologic ﬁ ndings suggestive of 
RHD was ultimately associated with a novel rabbit cali-
civirus, designated MRCV. Although other pathogens, 
principally P. multocida, were identiﬁ ed in some animals, 
these were not consistently present, and the disease lesions 
and presentation were not typical of pasteurellosis. Other 
hemorrhage-inducing agents, such as anticoagulants or 
enterohemorrhagic E. coli (14), were not identiﬁ ed. In the 
animals submitted toward the end of the outbreak, the his-
tologic ﬁ ndings were consistent with a reparative response 
to a previous liver insult. Similar reparative histologic ﬁ nd-
ings have been identiﬁ ed in rabbits surviving experimental 
challenge with less virulent strains of RHDV (15).

and sudden death in rabbits should consider the possibil-
ity of low pathogenicity lagoviruses once RHDV has been 
ruled out. The prevalence and effects of low pathogenicity

their potential inﬂ uence on seropositivity and susceptibility 
to RHDV remain to be determined.

Pandemic Inﬂ uenza as 21st Century 
Urban Public Health Crisis

Europe, and 2 in North America. Currently, 1 in 25 persons 
lives in a megacity; in Latin America, the ratio is 1 in 7. 
In central Tokyo, the population density is 5,847 persons/
km2 (1). Cities are increasing in developing countries and 
often have slums that lack basic services (2). The accel-
erating global trend toward megacities is a new paradigm 
of human existence and poses profound public health chal-
lenges. New approaches for surveillance, preparedness, and 
response will be needed because current strategies may not 
be easily scalable upward to address huge, densely popu-
lated areas, especially in developing countries.
In 2008, the World Health Organization (WHO) In-
ternational Health Regulations (IHR) Coordination Depart-
ment, in collaboration with Lyonbiopole (Lyon, France), 
held a consultation, Cities and Public Health Crises (1). 
Consultants stated that WHO and national guidance does 
not always adequately address the challenges their cities 
face, and they could learn much from each other. This ar-
ticle summarizes these challenges, illustrated by the initial 
appearance of inﬂ uenza A pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus 
during spring 2009 in Mexico City, Mexico, and New York 
(NYC), New York, USA (metropolitan area populations 20 
million and 19 million, respectively). These megacities 
may not be representative of cities in low-income coun-
tries, which face more daunting problems.
The percentage of the world’s population living in urban 
areas will increase from 50% in 2008 to 70% (4.9 billion) in 
2025. Crowded urban areas in developing and industrial-
ized countries are uniquely vulnerable to public health cri-
ses and face daunting challenges in surveillance, response, 
and public communication. The revised International Health 
Regulations require all countries to have core surveillance 
and response capacity by 2012. Innovative approaches 
are needed because traditional local-level strategies may 
not be easily scalable upward to meet the needs of huge, 
densely populated cities, especially in developing countries. 
The responses of Mexico City and New York City to the ini-
tial appearance of inﬂ uenza A pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus 
during spring 2009 illustrate some of the new challenges 
and creative response strategies that will increasingly be 
needed in cities worldwide.
A
ccording to United Nations estimates, the percentage 
of the world’s population living in urban areas will 
increase from 50% in 2008 to 70% (4.9 billion persons) in 
2025. During 2007–2025, the number of cities with popu-
lation 1–5 million will increase from 382 to 524, and the

National surveillance detected an atypical increase in 
inﬂ uenza-like illness (ILI) in mid to late February 2009 and 
a further increase in early to mid April. Anecdotal reports 
in April of increased hospitalizations of previously healthy 
young adults with severe pneumonia led to active surveil-

lance in 23 hospitals in Mexico City and identiﬁ cation of 47 
such cases. Patient samples showed nonsubtypeable inﬂ u-
enza A, identiﬁ ed on April 23 as a novel inﬂ uenza A virus 
of subtype H1N1. The Mexico City response was based on 
early adaptation of a pandemic inﬂ uenza preparedness plan 
that had been developed for a virus originating abroad. Af-
ter an expert meeting convened by the secretary of health, 
given the uncertain potential health impact, the president 
of Mexico invoked emergency powers; on April 24, com-
munity mitigation measures were implemented in Mexico 
City and the neighboring state of Mexico (3–7). These 
measures were announced and coordinated by the federal 
government, with participation of state authorities. The ob-
jective was to decrease transmission; elements included an 
intensive mass media campaign to inform the population 
about inﬂ uenza, promote personal and environmental hy-
giene, request that sick persons stay home, and implement 
social distancing measures. Persons with ILI were encour-
aged to seek prompt medical care. Early in the epidemic, 
the federal government released antiviral drugs from the 
national strategic reserve and controlled their distribution. 
Ill persons and their close contacts had access to this medi-
cation free of charge. During the spring outbreak, an es-
timated 150,000 cases of ILI with 3,312 hospitalizations 
occurred in metropolitan Mexico City (H. Lopez-Gatell, 
pers. comm.).
Following the Mexican Pandemic Plan, a program 
of social mobilization was implemented through a multi-
faceted mass media saturation campaign featuring visual 
representations and a previously developed and tested mes-
sage icon, Promi, to address Mexico City’s heterogeneous 
population and literacy rates (Figure 1). The private sec-
tor, including pharmacy chains, food stores, and cellular 
telephone companies, helped deliver health messages. The 
Mexican telephone company (Telmex) assembled a call 
center that received >5 million calls. Novel communica-
tion strategies included text messaging and mass emails; 
information from the Ministry of Health was transmit-
ted through >140 million text, 60 million printed, and 18 
million email messages. Multilingual health information 
materials also were provided to all international travelers 
entering and exiting through Mexican ports, and departing 
travelers underwent thermal screening.
Frequent hand washing and cough etiquette were pro-
moted, and all government and private facilities open to the 
public were provided with alcohol gel and other disinfec-
tants. Because of limited water availability in some areas or 
households, alcohol gel was distributed free. A mass media 
campaign promoting a healthy distance discouraged greet-
ing others by hugging or kissing, common practice among 
Mexicans of all social strata. Military personnel distributed 
disposable surgical masks in public places; their use was 
recommended primarily for sick persons, but many healthy 
persons also wore them daily. Compliance with recommen-
dations appeared to be high, although some persons wear-
ing masks may have developed a false sense of security that 
took priority over cough etiquette and hand washing. When 
commercially available masks became scarce, some persons 
made their own, and disposal occasionally was problematic, 
resulting in littering. Over time, recommendations about 
cough and sneeze etiquette were followed least frequently.
All educational facilities were closed beginning April 
24 in Mexico City and, soon after, nationwide. Parents 
were advised to keep children at home; authorities dis-
tributed educational materials for home use. By May 11,

care is provided by 3 major healthcare systems; thus 
compilation of epidemiologic information regarding hos-
pitalizations was complex. However, after a few days, a 
system was devised that provided the necessary consoli-
dated information. Laboratory capacity was inadequate 
for the challenges posed by the outbreak. At the onset of 
the outbreak, the Ministry of Health had no state-level 
laboratories with capabilities for inﬂ uenza molecular diag-
nostics; all molecular diagnosis was centralized at the Na-
tional Epidemiological Reference Laboratory in Mexico 
City. The Ministry of Health rapidly improved the national 
laboratory network and Mexico has now 28 laboratories 
(1 in nearly every state) with PCR molecular diagnostic 
capabilities. Although having a pandemic plan was use-
ful, operationalizaton of the plan was less smooth. For 
example, procedures existed to close schools, but criteria 
for reopening them and the ability to reassure parents that 
reopened schools were safe did not.
NYC
Emergency preparedness planning in NYC accelerated 
after the World Trade Center and anthrax attacks of 2001 
and in anticipation of an inﬂ uenza pandemic. Novel syndro-
mic surveillance systems monitor visits to hospital emer-
gency departments, calls to emergency medical services, 
pharmacy sales, worker absenteeism, and outpatient clinic 
visits. For example, information is collected electronically 
for ≈90% of daily patient visits from 77% of emergency de-
partments. Patients’ age, sex, home postal code, and chief 
complaint, but not names, are transmitted daily to the NYC 
Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, where proto-
cols identify and follow up signals that suggest increased 
when educational facilities reopened, all schools had been 
thoroughly cleaned. Parents were requested to keep ill 
children home; peer pressure among parents to comply 
was high. Every day, upon arrival at school, children were 
screened for fever and respiratory symptoms. Ill children 
were sent home to receive care; return to school required 
a note from their primary healthcare provider granting 
medical clearance.
In addition to federal measures, on April 27, the mayor 
of Mexico City suspended dine-in service in all restaurants 
and similar establishments, allowing only take-out orders. 
Many restaurants simply remained closed. When affected 
businesses were allowed to reopen on May 6, social dis-
tancing measures (e.g., avoiding crowding) were encour-
aged, and hygiene measures were enforced (Figure 2). 
Grocery stores and supermarkets remained open, with ad-
ditional cashiers used to keep lines short. Persons in public 
places were advised to remain separated by at least 2 m. 
Large gatherings were cancelled or postponed, and enter-
tainment venues, e.g., movie theaters, were closed. Profes-
sional sports matches were broadcast, but stadiums were 
closed to the public. Churches and temples also remained 
closed, with religious services broadcast over radio and 
television. When normal services resumed, communion 
cups and other shared objects were wiped with hand gel 
after each use. Mass transit operated normally. Masks 
were provided for drivers and passengers and buses and 
subway cars were cleaned frequently. Mitigation measures 
were broadly accepted by the public. Occasional early dis-
crepancies between recommendations from ofﬁ cial and 
academic sources (e.g., regarding mask use) led to a few 
critical media reports without apparent consequence. Thou-
sands of workplaces of all sizes in Mexico City and the rest 
of the country were closed for several days, taking a huge 
toll on the economy. The government provided no ﬁ nan-
cial compensation to businesses or workers. The economic 
impact of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus in Mexico during 
the spring is estimated as >$2.3 billion (0.3% of gross do-
mestic product) (8).
Most important among the many lessons learned in 
Mexico is that preparation paid off. Although requiring ad-
aptation, the preexisting pandemic plan and planning pro-
cess facilitated intersectoral work, decision making, and 
rapid development of a public communications campaign. 
The availability of a national stockpile of antiviral drugs 
reassured the public. The participation of the secretary of 
health as the spokesman demonstrated high-level leader-
ship. Clear and transparent communication was important 
because Mexico was entering mid-term elections, and some 
politicians hypothesized that the outbreak was a farce to 
distract Mexicans.
The outbreak also enabled detection of some weak-
nesses in the Mexican health system. In Mexico, health-

community illness. During spring 2009, these systems were 
essential for real-time monitoring of the pandemic in NYC, 
e.g., documenting large increases in children with ILI seek-
ing care at emergency departments) and for tracking its 
spread throughout the city from 1 school where it apparently 
was ﬁ rst introduced and ampliﬁ ed (9). Additional systems 
collect etiologic information from, for example, virologic 
studies on samples of outpatients and hospitalized patients 
with ILI. However, the ﬁ rst indication to the health depart-
ment of the outbreak of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus came 
from a school nurse telephoning a report of increased ILI 
at a single school. Subsequent surveillance and telephone 
surveys indicated ≈750,000–1 million persons in NYC had 
ILI during the spring outbreak (10).
When the ﬁ rst cases were conﬁ rmed, an extensive pub-
lic communication campaign was implemented through 
Ready New York, a preexisting program of the NYC Ofﬁ ce 
of Emergency Preparedness (11). The program includes 
outreach to ethnic populations and translation into many 
languages. The principal messages were 1) wash hands 
thoroughly and frequently with soap and water; 2) avoid 
contact with persons who are obviously sick; and 3) if you 
get sick with any cold or inﬂ uenza, stay home from work or 
school, and avoid contact with others as much as possible
During the epidemic peak, the mayor and health com-
missioner held frequent press conferences in English and 
Spanish. A NYC government information hotline (311) 
previously had been established and featured live operators 
24/7, with 98% of calls answered within 30 seconds. Dur-
ing the spring outbreak of pandemic (H1N1) 2009, ≈54,000 
calls to 311 about inﬂ uenza and a smaller health depart-
ment hotline were answered. An electronic health alert net-
work and conference calls provided messages to healthcare 
providers.
Aside from the public messages, community miti-
gation measures focused on selective closure of schools. 
Household contacts of case-patients were not quarantined, 
businesses were not closed, and public gatherings were not 
cancelled unless they involved closed schools. School clo-
sures were decided on an individual basis (known as “reac-
tive” closures, based on visits for ILI to the school health 
nurse and on other factors, such as the ability of students 
to comply with respiratory hygiene) rather than “preemp-
tively” (i.e., before cases in the school but with reports of 
cases in other schools in the subdistrict or district). Approx-
imately 50 schools closed, for ≈1 week each.
The NYC emergency stockpile of antiviral drugs was 
not used because normal distribution channels sufﬁ ced. 
Occasional reports of spot shortages required rapid inves-
tigation and highlighted the need for close communication 
with private distributors. If the stockpile had been needed, 
antiviral drugs would have been distributed to community 
health centers, public clinics, and hospitals. 
Distribution of vaccine for pandemic (H1N1) 2009 in 
NYC will depend on indications for use, availability, and 
urgency of administration. Vaccine will be prioritized for 
high-risk populations (12). Mass vaccination campaigns will 
use 200 point-of-distribution sites developed to meet pos-
sible needs for anthrax prophylaxis, e.g., school buildings 
throughout the city that each could serve ≈40,000 persons.
Problems included basing decisions on a pandemic se-
verity index because, at the pandemic onset, its case-fatal-
ity ratio was uncertain. Despite previous planning, several 
school dismissal issues had never been entirely resolved, 
including the objectives of closure in a less severe pandem-
ic (i.e., to protect high-risk students, all students, families; 
to slow community transmission; to allay public fears). The 
effectiveness of school closure in meeting these objectives 
was uncertain, as was the extent to which beneﬁ ts justiﬁ ed 
the secondary impact, including interrupting the academic 
program, parental work loss, and disruption of services 
provided at school (e.g., free breakfast and lunch to chil-
dren from low-income families, therapy for students with 
special needs).
Operational questions included criteria for school dis-
missal and reopening and difﬁ culties in monitoring ILI and 
even absenteeism rates among students. Absenteeism data 
were often unavailable to the health department until mid-
afternoon, relatively late to notify parents about closure de-
cisions for the next school day. Instructions were not given 
for children to remain at home, and some may have recon-
gregated elsewhere, such as in public libraries, while their 
parents were at work (13). News of school closures in NYC 
led to questions from parents in suburban jurisdictions 
about why their schools remained open, even though they 
had no known cases. Individual school closings showed the 
interconnectedness between schools, such as when siblings 
or neighbors attended different ones. The issue of worker 
or business compensation for lost time from work to care 
for ill children remains difﬁ cult. On the basis of this experi-
ence, in the 2009–10 school year, NYC is urging parents to 
keep sick children home and emphasizing infection control 
at school but will close a school only as a last resort. Clo-
sure decisions will be made on an individual basis, taking 
into account whether infection control practices could be 
improved and whether a high percentage of students have 
high-risk medical conditions (10).
During spring 2009, emergency departments were 
overcrowded with the worried ill, despite many announce-
ments about indications for persons with ILI to seek medi-
cal care. In the fall and winter of 2009 hospitals are pre-
pared to open additional nonemergency ILI care sites (e.g., 
at primary care clinics). A new 1-stop inﬂ uenza Web portal 
provides information, as well as locations of clinical sites, 
and a call center staffed by nurses accessed through the 311 
hotline provides guidance to persons with ILI (10).

include use of cell phones and the Internet. Illness surveil-
lance ultimately depends on the organization and provision 
of health services; cities with universal health coverage will 
have important advantages (17). Outbreak recognition still 
often depends on alert clinicians; technology-based systems 
notwithstanding, a school nurse provided the ﬁ rst indication 
of the inﬂ uenza outbreak in NYC.
In the city jail, cases of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 led to 
screening and control measures. These included isolation 
and cohorting of ill prisoners, and quarantine of those who 
had been exposed to them, to limit the spread of infection 
in the prison and court systems.
Health department stafﬁ ng to meet surge needs posed 
challenges, including accessing and training staff from 
other parts of the health department, especially physicians, 
and the need to ensure staff time off to prevent burnout. 
Keeping policies and press releases consistent in the face of 
changing science and policies required constant attention. 
Internet survey instruments were effectively used to col-
lect epidemiologic data, as in the initial high school student 
outbreak (9).
Issues for Cities
The experiences from the response to the emergence 
of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus in Mexico City and NYC 
highlighted several challenges raised at the WHO consul-
tation (1). These include response coordination, surveil-
lance and monitoring of illness trends, disease contain-
ment and mitigation, delivery of countermeasures, and 
public communication.
Disease Containment and Mitigation
Although not generally a problem in Mexico City or 
NYC during spring 2009, in a larger outbreak in a lower-
income country, home isolation or quarantine may be dif-
ﬁ cult or impossible for large urban families living in 1 or 
2 rooms. Contact tracing is problematic in cities, given the 
frequency of anonymous interactions. Innovative use of 
nonhealth databases and 3-dimensional mapping, includ-
ing cell phone records and global positioning technologies, 
may be helpful but may pose privacy issues.
Decisions regarding school dismissal are problematic 
because effectiveness for disease mitigation is difﬁ cult 
to quantify, and operational aspects often are uncertain, 
whereas the potential for societal disruption is considerable. 
Analysis is pending of the different approaches taken by 
Mexico City and NYC during spring 2009, but both have 
kept schools open during the fall, because pandemic sever-
ity has remained comparable with that in the spring. This 
approach is consistent with updated guidance from WHO 
and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
(18,19). Many questions remain about how to implement 
social distancing and infection control measures in typical 
city venues, including schools, institutions of higher educa-
tion, healthcare institutions, mass transit, workplaces, and 
marketplaces. These issues are even more difﬁ cult in devel-
oping countries. Many cities have international airports and 
may need to assist in health screening of passengers; provide 
medical care to ill passengers; and accommodate stranded 
passengers, including those in quarantine. Evacuation of a 
city poses additional public health challenges (17,20).
Response Coordination
Multiple government agencies serve large urban areas. 
Citizens frequently live, work, attend school in, and com-
mute through different jurisdictions. Different political par-
ties may control national, state or provincial, suburban, and 
city governments. Fringe groups or gangs may effectively 
control some areas. Incident or uniﬁ ed command systems 
can be useful approaches to crisis coordination (14,15). In 
Mexico City and NYC, advance planning, political leader-
ship at the highest levels, and collaboration among public 
health and emergency management agencies were particu-
larly important.
Coordination with the private sector often is not well 
established. Businesses can assist, notably by providing 
health messages and enabling infectious workers to remain 
home (16). Large companies may have contacts with city 
leaders, but most are small to medium-sized enterprises 
with which coordination may be difﬁ cult. Multinational 
corporations, common in cities, may be subject to home-
country inﬂ uences. Response coordination with nongov-
ernment, community, and faith-based organizations also 
is important. Outbreaks in cities near international borders 
require coordination with foreign partners.
Delivery of Countermeasures
Rapid delivery of countermeasures, e.g., drugs and 
vaccines, is difﬁ cult even for persons with known, ﬁ xed 
addresses, but more so for persons in slums, travelers, un-
documented persons, and homeless persons, as well as the 
elderly and homebound. Measures taken in Mexico City 
and NYC during spring 2009 appear to have been sufﬁ -
cient, but these systems are being tested again during the 
2009–10 winter season.
Surveillance and Monitoring of Illness Trends
Emerging challenges in cities include the vertical di-
mension (high-rise apartment blocks), travelers, and persons 
who do not have ﬁ xed addresses or who live in slums. Novel 
approaches for illness reporting and population surveys may

and planning ahead (21). The generally successful pub-
lic communication campaigns of Mexico City and NYC 
incorporated these approaches. In addition to traditional 
mass media and the Internet, they also used cell phones 
and text messaging, which may offer useful models for 
developing countries. Cell phone networks may need to 
prioritize health or emergency messages, improved ro-
bustness to permit high trafﬁ c during emergencies, and re-
dundancy in case transmitting towers are destroyed (e.g., 
in a storm). Text messages can be targeted geographically, 
e.g., to phones locked on to a particular transmitting tower 
at the time of the message. This approach could be useful 
for broadcasting localized alerts and instructions, such as 
locations of vaccination clinics.

Discussion
Cities are the norm of global development in the 21st 
century. As cities become larger and more crowded, tra-
ditional guidance for detecting and responding to public 
health crises requires innovation. Modiﬁ ed guidance may 
be helpful, but new strategies, technologies, and metrics 
also will be needed.
Preliminary accounts of response to pandemic (H1N1) 
2009 during spring 2009 in 2 world megacities offer 
grounds for optimism. In each case, advance planning laid 
the foundation for enhanced surveillance and a generally 
effective response, made possible by an extensive public 
communications campaign and effective political leader-
ship. On the other hand, challenges emerged that would 
have been ampliﬁ ed if the illness had been more severe or 
the period of societal disruption prolonged. Development 
of new guidance and approaches requires collaboration 
among large cities, as well as research and evaluation to 
identify best practices for cities with different resource 
levels, particularly for implementing core capacity re-
quirements under the revised IHR in a world where most 
persons now live in urban environments. The IHR require 
all countries to have core capacity for disease “surveil-
lance, reporting, notiﬁ cation, veriﬁ cation, response and 
collaboration activities” by 2012 (22,23). These require-
ments must be implemented in urban environments, but 
they are based on traditional public health levels (local, 
intermediate, and national), which are less clearly deﬁ ned 
for large urban agglomerations. All national governments 
have committed themselves to IHR implementation; mu-
nicipalities must play a central role but may not be aware 
of their obligations or able to meet them. Many partners 
will be important, including businesses, which may not 
realize their stake in IHR implementation (24). Sharing 
of experience and research is needed to develop strategies 
and best practices that can be considered by similar cities 
worldwide.

Emergence of resistance to oseltamivir by seasonal in-
ﬂ uenza A virus (H1N1) was detected in Norway in 2007. 
This virus has evolved into the dominant inﬂ uenza A virus 
(H1N1) in humans (6). This ﬁ nding raises strong concerns 
that the 274Y resistant mutation in pandemic (H1N1) 2009 
virus might circulate and become dominant. We report vi-
rologic investigation of the emergence of oseltamivir resis-
tance in this virus in a patient from Hong Kong.

Resistance to oseltamivir was observed in inﬂ uenza 
A pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus isolated from an untreated 
person in Hong Kong, China. Investigations showed a re-
sistant virus with the neuraminidase (NA) 274Y genotype in 
quasi-species from a nasopharyngeal aspirate. Monitoring 
for the naturally occurring NA 274Y mutation in this virus is 
necessary.
E
mergence of inﬂ uenza A pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus, 
presumably from swine to humans, has spread glob-
ally since April 2009 (1–3). This emergence prompted the 
World Health Organization to declare a pandemic caused 
by this virus on June 11, 2009. Although most cases of in-
fection are mild or asymptomatic, 1,462 fatal cases were 
reported to the World Health Organization as of August 6, 
2009 (www.who.int/csr/don/2009_09_11/en/index.html). 
Experimental evidence from animal models showed 
that this virus was able to replicate to high titers in the lungs 
of infected animals (4), unlike seasonal inﬂ uenza viruses, 
which mainly infect the upper respiratory tract. Serologic 
studies found that antibodies induced by current seasonal 
inﬂ uenza vaccines show little cross-reactivity to pandemic 
(H1N1) 2009 virus (5).
Therapeutic options are presently limited to 2 
neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors, oseltamivir and zanamivir, 
because this virus has a swine-origin matrix 2 (M2) gene, 
which contains a mutation associated with resistance to 
M2 ion channel blockers amantadine and rimantadine. Al-
though oseltamivir has been widely used in persons infect-
ed with pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus, resistance was not 
observed until recently. Three unrelated cases of resistance 
to oseltamivir were observed in Denmark, Japan, and Hong

The Study
A 16-year-old previously healthy girl had a fever at 
the Hong Kong International Airport after her arrival from 
San Francisco, California, USA, on June 11, 2009. Physical 
examination showed a temperature of 38.3°C, a blood pres-
sure of 117/66 mm Hg, a pulse rate of 94 beats/min, and an 
oxygen saturation of 99% at room air. Results of a com-
plete blood count and liver and renal function tests were 
normal. She had a leukocyte count of 4.69 × 109 cells/L, an 
absolute neutrophil count of 2.36 × 109 cells/L, and a lym-
phocyte count of 1.74 × 109 cells/L. Findings on her chest 
radiograph were normal.
A nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) was positive for 
inﬂ uenza A virus (H1N1) nucleoprotein by immunoﬂ uo-
rescence. NPA specimens on days 1 and 5 were positive 
for inﬂ uenza A virus (H1N1) M gene and swine-speciﬁ c 
speciﬁ c H1 gene by reverse transcription–PCR (RT-PCR). 
Samples obtained on days 6–8 were negative. Serum and 
midstream urine specimens obtained on day 2 were nega-
tive for inﬂ uenza A virus (H1N1) M gene by RT-PCR. 
The patient refused antiviral therapy with oseltamivir 
because of fear of its potential side effects. She was then of-
fered symptomatic treatment. Her clinical condition gradual-
ly improved and she was discharged on day 8 uneventfully.
Inﬂ uenza A pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus was cultured 
from NPA. Subsequent drug susceptibility testing showed 
that this isolate was resistant to oseltamivir (50% inhibitory 
concentration 197.5 nM), but susceptible to zanamivir, as 
determined by enzymatic assay (Table).
To conﬁ rm whether the virus contained mutations 
associated with resistance to NA inhibitors, NA se-
quences from the day 1 NPA specimen and an MDCK 
cell isolate were examined. Viral RNA was extracted 
from NPA and MDCK cell supernatants by using re-
ported procedures (7). RT-PCR was performed by using 
primers spanning position 274 of the NA gene (forward: 
5′-ACACAAGAGTCTGAATGTGCATGT-3′; 
reverse: 
5′-GTCTCCGAAAATCCCACTGCATAT-3′). Direct se-
quencing of PCR products was performed by using a Big-
Dye Terminator v3.1 cycle sequencing reaction kit on an 
ABI PRISM 3730 DNA analyzer (Applied Biosystems, 
Foster City, CA, USA).

*50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) for oseltamivir and zanamivir were determined by using NA-Star influenza neuraminidase (NA) inhibitor resistance 
detection kits (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Ratios of 274H and 274Y were evaluated by 
cloning neuraminidase (NA) gene PCR products from nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) samples or MDCK cell–cultured virus into the TA vector (Invitrogen, 
Carlsbad, CA, USA) and sequencing clones containing the NA gene. ND, not done. 
Lack of general immunity to pandemic (H1N1) 2009 
virus in the human population, combined with the inher-
ent adamantane resistance of the virus, indicates that NA 
inhibitors constitute the primary treatment regimen for 
susceptible patient groups and those in whom severe dis-
eases develop during the current pandemic. There is great 
concern that an oseltamivir-resistant variant of pandemic 
(H1N1) 2009 virus may emerge and circulate in a manner 
similar to oseltamivir-resistant seasonal inﬂ uenza A virus 
(H1N1).
The patient in this study was not treated with oselta-
mivir. Therefore it is unlikely that the 274Y mutation was 
drug-induced. Detection of mixed populations of 274Y and 
274H in the NPA specimen before antiviral treatment sug-
gests that the mutation occurs naturally, either before or 
during infection. Although no experimental data exist that 
show the growth properties of this resistant variant, exami-
nation of the quasi-species population in the cell culture–
Sequences indicated that the NA genes in the NPA and 
MDCK cell virus isolates contained an H→Y mutation at 
the NA 274 (H3 numbering, 275 in H1 numbering) residue 
(GenBank accession no. GQ351316). No other NA muta-
tions known to be associated with oseltamivir resistance 
were observed. Further examination of sequences showed 
mixed populations (T/C) in the NA gene from the NPA 
specimen (Figure, panel A).
Estimation of 274H and 274Y populations in the NPA 
specimen was performed by cloning and sequencing PCR 
products. The NPA specimen contained approximately 
equal proportions of 274Y and 274H (52.63% and 47.37%, 
respectively). Examination of sequences from the MDCK 
cell isolate showed predominantly the 274Y type, although 
a minor 274H peak was also observed (Figure, panel B). 
Cloning and sequencing of PCR products from the MDCK 
virus isolate showed that 97.92% of the NA genes were 
274Y, which suggests that the 274Y population overtook 
the 274H population during MDCK cell culture.
Conclusions
Resistance to NA inhibitors among seasonal strains of 
human inﬂ uenza viruses (A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and B) has 
been rare until recently. Development of resistance after os-
eltamivir treatment has occurred in 0.33%–5.5% of treated 
patients (8). Oseltamivir resistance associated with the NA 
274Y genotype was also observed in human infections with 
avian inﬂ uenza A virus (H5N1) (9,10). Low levels of 274Y 
quasi-species in avian inﬂ uenza A viruses (H5N1) from 
avian hosts has been reported (11). Oseltamivir-resistant 
human inﬂ uenza A viruses (H3N2 and H1N1) have been 
found to replicate less efﬁ ciently than oseltamivir-suscepti-
ble strains in cell culture and animal models (12–14). How-
ever, the NA 274Y resistant mutant in highly pathogenic 
avian inﬂ uenza A virus (H5N1) retained the high pathoge-
nicity of wild-type virus in mammalian species (15).
In 2007, an NA H274Y oseltamivir-resistant variant of 
seasonal inﬂ uenza A virus (H1N1) was detected in Norway 
(6). This virus has now become the dominant virus popula-
tion globally, overtaking oseltamivir-susceptible inﬂ uenza 
A virus (H1N1). The molecular basis for the 274Y variant 
in seasonal inﬂ uenza A virus (H1N1) virus and the mecha-
nism by which this resistant variant became the dominant 
population remain unknown.

DISPATCHES
propagated virus isolate showed that the 274Y variant has 
become the dominant population. This ﬁ nding implies that 
the 274Y mutation does not compromise replication of 
pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus in vitro.
Quarantine procedures adopted by the Hong Kong 
Special Administrative Region in China during the early 
containment phase might have limited transmission of this 
variant virus. Knowledge of this virus is still limited, and 
characterization of transmission properties of this resistant 
variant in in vitro and in vivo models is needed. Moreover, 
pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus should be closely monitored 
for emergence of resistant variants.

Outbreak of Antiviral 
Drug–Resistant 
Inﬂ uenza A in 
Long-Term Care 
Facility, Illinois, 
USA, 2008

An outbreak of oseltamivir-resistant inﬂ uenza A (H1N1) 
occurred in a long-term care facility. Eight (47%) of 17 and 
1 (6%) of 16 residents in 2 wards had oseltamivir-resistant 
inﬂ uenza A virus (H1N1) infections. Initial outbreak response 
included treatment and prophylaxis with oseltamivir. The out-
break abated, likely because of infection control measures.
O
utbreaks of inﬂ uenza virus infection cause illness and 
death, especially among residents of long-term care 
facilities (LTCFs). In addition to annual vaccination and in-
fection control measures, antiviral agents for treatment and 
prophylaxis are useful components for control of inﬂ uenza 
outbreaks in LTCFs (1–4), especially in years with vaccine 
strain mismatches (4).
Two classes of antiviral agents are licensed for use in 
the United States: adamantanes (amantadine and rimanta-
dine) and neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir and zana-
mivir). Circulation of inﬂ uenza A viruses resistant to both 
classes of antiviral agents, A (H3N2) to adamantanes and 
A (H1N1) to oseltamivir, was reported during the 2007–08 
inﬂ uenza season (5). We describe an outbreak of illness 
in an LTCF caused by 2 inﬂ uenza viruses, an oseltamivir-
resistant A virus (H1N1) and an adamantane-resistant A 
virus (H3N2), during January 2008.
The Study
The LTCF in Illinois provides housing, healthcare 
services, and recreational activities for residents with neu-
rologic and developmental medical conditions. During the 
outbreak, the LTCF housed 583 residents. Building A, the 
main site of the inﬂ uenza outbreak, housed 108 residents 
in 6 wards; 104 (96%) received the 2007–08 inﬂ uenza vac-
cine. Of the 685 LTCF employees involved in direct patient 
care, 385 (56%) received the 2007–08 inﬂ uenza vaccine 
on site.
We deﬁ ned a conﬁ rmed case as a positive rapid or 
reverse transcription–PCR result for inﬂ uenza virus from 
January 20 through February 8, 2008, in a resident of the 
LTCF. Surveillance for new case-patients included obtain-
ing a nasopharyngeal specimen from all residents with new 
onset of fever or respiratory symptoms or any unusual be-
havior within 24 hours after illness onset. All specimens 
were tested by using the QuickVue A and B Inﬂ uenza Test 
(Quidel, San Diego, CA, USA). A second specimen was 
obtained from all persons with positive rapid test results and 
some (57%) from persons with negative results for conﬁ r-
mation of inﬂ uenza virus infection and virus subtyping by 
reverse transcription–PCR. Medical records, vaccination 
records, resident activity, and visitor logs were reviewed.
Testing for antiviral drug resistance was conducted di-
rectly on clinical specimens by pyrosequencing as described 
(6,7), including identiﬁ cation of the oseltamivir resistance–
conferring H274Y mutation in the neuraminidase gene of 
inﬂ uenza viruses (H1N1) (H275Y in N1 numbering) and 
the adamantane resistance–conferring mutations in the ma-
trix 2 protein (7,8). The HA1 portion of the hemagglutinin 
(HA) gene of the outbreak viruses was sequenced and com-
pared with those of epidemiologically relevant viruses.
Phylogenetic analysis of HA1 was performed by using 
MEGA version 4.0.1 software (9). A phylogenetic tree was 
inferred by using maximum composite likelihood available 
in MEGA version 4.0.1. The outbreak investigation was 
considered a public health response and granted exemption 
from review by the Institutional Review Board of the Cen-
ters for Disease Control and Prevention.
On January 27, the ﬁ rst 3 residents with fever or respi-
ratory symptoms in ward 1 within building A were positive 
for inﬂ uenza A virus infection by rapid test (Figure 1). On 
January 28, outbreak infection control measures were initi-
ated in all 6 wards, including surveillance for new cases, 
5 days of treatment with oseltamivir for conﬁ rmed cases, 
and 14 days of prophylaxis with oseltamivir for all healthy 
residents in wards with conﬁ rmed case-patients (2). Con-
ﬁ rmed case-patients were quarantined in their rooms for 
10 days; all residents in all 6 wards were quarantined for 
10 days, and visitor movement was restricted. Staff and

Date of illness onset
Characteristics of case-patients are shown in the Ta-
ble. Establishing a ﬁ rm epidemiologic link between cases, 
other than ward of residency, was not possible. Antivi-
ral drug resistance results became available on February 
7 when all case-patients had completed their treatment 
courses. Ongoing prophylaxis courses were changed: os-
eltamivir was replaced with rimantadine in ward 1, and 
rimantadine was added to oseltamivir in ward 2. Prophy-
laxis with oseltamivir alone was continued in ward 3. 
Zanamivir could not be used by most residents because of 
underlying conditions.
Sequence analysis of the HA1 gene in outbreak inﬂ u-
enza A viruses (H1N1) showed identical or nearly iden-
tical sequences, differing by only 1 or 2 nt (Figure 2). 
These viruses were phylogenetically more closely related 
to A/Brisbane/59/2007 (H1N1) than to the A/Solomon 
Islands/3/2006, the inﬂ uenza A virus (H1N1) strain in the 
2007–08 inﬂ uenza vaccine. GenBank accession numbers 
of HA (HA1) sequences for the 9 oseltamivir-resistant in-
ﬂ uenza A viruses (H1N1) are FJ231752–FJ231760.

potential missed case-patient with inﬂ uenza who had symptom 
onset on January 29. Additional cases were detected in 2 other 
residential buildings in the long-term care facility (buildings B 
and C). Building B housed 53 residents in 4 wards and building 
C housed 16 residents in 1 ward. All (100%) of residents in both 
buildings had received the 2007–08 inﬂ uenza vaccine. Of the 16 
rapid test specimens with negative results from all 3 buildings that 
were subjected to conﬁ rmatory testing, 5 (31%) were positive by 
reverse transcription–PCR for inﬂ uenza A virus (H1N1).

sistant inﬂ uenza A viruses (H1N1) in ward 1 was within 
the range (20%–80%) reported for other facility inﬂ uenza 
outbreaks (1,10,11), indicating effective person-to-person 
transmission of oseltamivir-resistant inﬂ uenza A viruses 
(H1N1). Nosocomial transmission of oseltamivir-resis-
tant inﬂ uenza A viruses (H1N1), with possible healthcare 
worker involvement, has been described (12). We were un-

portion) of inﬂ uenza A viruses (H1N1) isolated during an inﬂ uenza 
A outbreak in a long-term care facility, Illinois, USA, 2008. Viruses 
from buildings A and B shared nearly identical sequences. One of 
the viruses from building B was more similar in sequence to 1 virus 
from building A. However, this ﬁ nding could reﬂ ect natural variance in 
circulating viruses. Red indicates outbreak viruses, boldface italics 
indicates vaccine strain for 2008–09, boldface indicates vaccine 
strain for 2007–08, and arrows indicate nucleotide differences in

visitors were required to use personal protective equipment 
and practice respiratory and hand hygiene. Prescriptions 
for prophylactic courses of oseltamivir and inﬂ uenza vac-
cinations were offered to all staff of building A; uptake was 
not recorded.
From January 28 through January 31, 2008, a total of 
6 additional conﬁ rmed case-patients were identiﬁ ed. Eight 
(47%) of 17 residents in ward 1 and 1 (6%) of 16 residents 
in ward 2 were infected with inﬂ uenza A viruses (H1N1) 
that contained the H274Y mutation but did not have mark-
ers of resistance to adamantanes or zanamivir.
On January 30, high fever developed in a male resident 
in ward 3 while on the ﬁ rst day of a home visit (Figure 1). 
He returned to building A on January 31, was positive for 
inﬂ uenza by rapid test, and was placed in ward 2 in an at-
tempt to group him with other already ill residents. Because 
of an ongoing outbreak in other nearby wards, oseltamivir 
prophylaxis was initiated for all residents in ward 3 who 
were not ill. On February 1, symptoms developed in 2 other 
residents in ward 3 who were positive for inﬂ uenza by rap-
id test. Three (18%) conﬁ rmed cases of inﬂ uenza A virus 
(H3N2) resistant to adamantanes but sensitive to oseltami-
vir were detected among 17 residents in ward 3. Additional 
cases, but no clusters, were detected in other buildings 1–2 
weeks later.

able to assess staff illness in this investigation. Before the 
2007–08 inﬂ uenza season, transmission of neuraminidase-
resistant inﬂ uenza viruses had rarely been reported (13).
Although we documented a relatively high attack rate 
in 1 ward (ward 1), and despite resistance to the antivi-
ral agent initially used, the outbreak abated quickly. High 
annual vaccination rates among residents and relatively 
high rates among employees (2) may have played a role in 
limiting the spread of the outbreak viruses. However, the 
A/Brisbane/59/2007 (H1N1)–like outbreak viruses were 
not optimally matched to the A/Solomon Islands/3/2006 
(H1N1) vaccine strain (14). Also, infection control mea-
sures, such as isolation and quarantine, likely played a role 
in controlling this outbreak.
The proportion of circulating inﬂ uenza viruses resistant 
to oseltamivir increased from 12% during the 2007–08 sea-
son to 99% during the 2008–09 season in the United States, 
and new interim guidelines for use of antiviral agents were 
released in December 2008 (15). These guidelines were up-
dated for the 2009–10 season to account for the emergence 
of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus in September 2009 (www.
cdc.gov/h1n1ﬂ u/recommendations.htm). This outbreak un-
derscores the possibility of 2 inﬂ uenza A viruses, with dif-
ferent antiviral susceptibilities, in the same facility. During 
a facility outbreak of inﬂ uenza, providers should consult

To explore geographic and host-taxonomic patterns of 
hantaviruses in Paraguay, we established sampling sites in 
the Mbaracayú Biosphere Reserve. We detected Jaborá vi-
rus and Itapúa37/Juquitiba–related virus in locations ≈20 m 
apart in different years, which suggested sympatry of 2 dis-
tinct hantaviruses.
H
antaviruses are rodent-borne viruses that may cause 
hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome or hantavirus 
pulmonary syndrome in humans, although some strains do 
not cause disease (1,2). In Paraguay in 1995, Laguna Ne-
gra virus carried by Calomys laucha (little laucha) caused 
an outbreak of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in western 
Paraguay (3). 
We have identiﬁ ed 4 additional strains in Paraguay: 
Alto Paraguay virus harbored by Holochilus chacarius 
(Chacoan marsh rat) in western Paraguay; and Ape Aime 
virus (AAIV) harbored by Akodon montensis (Montane 
akodont), Itapúa virus strain 37 (IPV37) harbored by Oli-
goryzomys nigripes (black-footed colilargo), and Bermejo 
virus strain Ñeembucu harbored by O. chacoensis (Cha-
coan colilargo) in eastern Paraguay (4,5). We have contin-
ued our surveillance of hantaviruses in the interior Atlantic 
forests within and near Reserva Natural del Bosque Mbara-
cayú (RNBM), a World Biosphere Reserve located within 
Departamento Canindeyú in eastern Paraguay (Figure 1).
The Study
We established and sampled 10 mark-recapture sites 
within and adjacent to RNBM during 2003–2007. Sampling 
of grids depended upon weather conditions, the purpose of 
the grid, and transitory human settlements. Each mark-re-
capture grid consisted of an 11 × 11 array of trap stations 
spaced 10 m apart, each of which had 1 standard live trap 
(H.B. Sherman Traps, Tallahassee, FL, USA) placed on 
the ground, and another in branches or vines 2–3 m above 
ground to capture arboreal species. Grids were sampled for 
8 nights, with at least 2 months between sampling sessions. 
Rodents captured in the mark-recapture grids were individ-
ually marked with passive integrated transponder tags, and 
≈100 μL of blood was collected from the retroorbital sinus 
(once per trapping session). Animals were identiﬁ ed to spe-
cies, age class, reproductive condition, sex, and weight and 
released.
Rodents were also collected in a series of traplines, 
each of which contained 50 traps placed ≈10 m apart. Ani-
mals collected in traplines were killed, standard collecting 
information was recorded, and liver, lung, heart, kidney, 
muscle tissues, and blood specimens were collected. All 
samples were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, transported to 
the Museum of Texas Tech University (TTU), and stored 
at –80°C. Standard voucher specimens were prepared from 
these animals, and have or will be deposited in the Muse-
um of TTU or the Museo Nacional de Historia Natural del 
Paraguay. All ﬁ eld protocols followed American Society of 
Mammologists guidelines for the use of wild mammals in 
research (6), and were reviewed and approved by the TTU 
Animal Care and Use Committee.
A total of 1,150 small mammals from >20 species 
were captured, including 13 sigmodontine rodent species

Figure 2. Phylogenetic tree based on Bayesian analysis of the 
small (S) segment of American hantaviruses, Paraguay, 2003–
2007. The tree is based on 1,014 nucleotides of partial S segment 
of North and South American hantaviruses. Clades (upper case 
letters), subclades (numbers), and groups (lower case letters) 
are indicated on the left. Numerical values at the nodes indicate 
posterior probabilities that supported each interior branch. Scale 
bar indicates mean number of nucleotide substitutions per site. 
Alignment and editing of nucleotide sequences were conducted by 
using Vector NTI version 10.3.1 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). 
Sample identiﬁ er numbers are the same as in Figure 1. Complete 
sequencing and abbreviation information is available online at 
www.cdc.gov/EID/content/15/12/1977-F2.htm.
In contrast, all virus sequences from O. fornesi, O. ni-
gripes, and Oryzomys sp. at RNBM formed a strongly sup-
ported clade with viruses related to Juquitiba virus (JUQV) 
from Brazil and Itapúa virus strain 37, which was originally 
detected in O. nigripes from Itapúa Department in eastern 
Paraguay (Figure 2, clade C2d). Nucleotide sequence dif-
ferences between JUQV strains from RNBM were 0%–2%. 
Nucleotide sequence differences between JUQV strains 
from RNBM and Itapúa virus strain 37 or JUQV (Brazil) 
were 5% or 4%, respectively, and derived amino acid dif-
ferences were 0% (Table 1). This clade is phylogenetically 
(1,140 animals) (online Technical Appendix, available 
from www.cdc.gov/EID/content/15/12/1977-Techapp.pdf). 
The dominant rodent species in Mbaracayú were A. mon-
tensis (55.7%), Necromys lasiurus (hairy-tailed akodont) 
(10.8%), C. callosus (big laucha) (6.5%), and O. fornesi 
(Fornes’ colilargo) (6.3%).
Antibodies to hantavirus antigens were detected in 
blood specimens by using an indirect immunoﬂ uorescent an-
tibody assay and irradiation-sterilized slides of Vero E6 cells 
infected with Andes virus as described (4). Seven species 
were antibody positive: A. montensis, N. lasiurus, O. forne-
si, O. nigripes, Oligoryzomys sp., Oryzomys megacephalus 
(Azara’s broad-headed Oryzomys sp.), and Oxymycterus de-
lator (Paraguayan hocicudo). Antibodies to hantavirus anti-
gens were 3× more abundant in blood samples from males 
than females (online Technical Appendix).
Total RNA was extracted from antibody-positive 
blood clots from mark-recapture samples or lung tissue 
from killed animals. Nested reverse transcription–PCR was 
performed to amplify a 371-nt small (S) hantavirus RNA 
segment (4). Hantavirus RNA was detected in 23 A. mon-
tensis, 5 O. fornesi, 1 O. nigripes, and 1 Oligoryzomys sp. 
Of these animals, all but 2 A. montensis were males, which 
indicated that male rodents play the primary role in mainte-
nance and transmission of hantavirus.
A representative sample (15 A. montensis, 3 O. fornesi, 
1 O. nigripes, and 1 Oligoryzomys sp.) were selected for 
additional PCR, sequencing, and phylogenetic analysis. 
PCR-ampliﬁ ed cDNAs of a 1,014-nt amino terminus re-
gion of the S segment were puriﬁ ed by agarose gel electro-
phoresis and cloned into pCRII (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, 
USA) (4,5). M13 forward and reverse primers were used 
for sequencing. For sequence comparison and phylogenetic 
analysis, sequences of representative New and Old World 
hantaviruses were obtained from GenBank. Phylogeny re-
construction was conducted by using Modeltest version 3.6 
analysis (http://darwin.uvigo.es/software/modeltest.html.), 
maximum-likelihood estimation, and Bayesian inference 
(Figure 2).
Bayesian analysis based on the 1,014-nt sequence 
showed that all sequences from A. montensis formed a 
strongly supported clade, which included AAIV-related 
hantaviruses from Itapúa Department, Jaborá virus (JABV) 
from southern Brazil, and strains from RNBM in Paraguay 
(Figure 2, clade C1). Phylogenetic analyses identiﬁ ed 3 
subclades representing virus sequences from animals in the 
RNBM, Itapúa, and southern Brazil. This type of geograph-
ic clustering is similar to Sin Nombre–related viruses in 
deer mice in North America (7). All S segment sequences 
from A. montensis were closely related, with nucleotide se-
quence differences between RNBM strains and AAIV and 
JABV of 4% and 12%, respectively, and derived amino 
acid differences of 0% or 1%, respectively (Table 1).

Conclusions
Coexistence of hantaviruses in 2 rodent species at 
mark-recapture sites has been observed (11–13). Serolog-
ic analyses in these studies would not have differentiated 
whether distinct strains of hantaviruses were co-circulating 
or active spillover infection was occurring among sym-
patric rodents at collection sites. Recently, Raboni et al. 
reported JUQV circulating in 3 sympatric rodent species 
in southern Brazil and 2 distinct hantaviruses (Jabora and 
JUQV) in 1 rodent species (A. montensis) (14). We have 
not detected JUQV in A. montensis in Paraguay. To address 
host-jumping of hantaviruses among sympatric rodent spe-
cies in RNBM and other regions in South America, future 
longitudinal studies are warranted. Such studies are critical 
to understanding evolutionary adaptation of hantaviruses in 
rodents in South America, the ability of these viruses to 
adapt to new rodent reservoirs, and their emergence and 
maintenance in the environment.
distinct from viruses that form the Akodon montensis clade 
at RNBM and more closely related to Andes (clade C2b) 
and Bermejo-Ñeembucú (clade C2a) viruses. This ﬁ nding 
suggests that spillover infection of JUQV-related viruses 
is actively occurring among oryzomyine rodent species at 
RNBM, as reported for other hantaviruses in oryzomyines 
(8) and other rodent hosts of Old World hantaviruses (9,10). 
Additional data are needed to determine the primary oryzo-
myine reservoir of JUQV and to better understand mecha-
nisms by which spillover occurs.
In addition to spillover infection of JUQV among ory-
zomyine rodents, we identiﬁ ed 2 virus strains (JUQV and 
JABV) in close proximity (collected ≈20 m apart on the 
same grid in the same sampling session) on 2 occasions, in 
sites separated by ≈30 km (Figure 1; Table 2). Thus, these 2 
distinct hantaviruses appear to be maintaining a sympatric 
status across a considerable expanse of landscape, rather 
than reﬂ ecting a temporary or localized phenomenon. We 
use the term sympatric to underscore that these viruses are 
in the same community and are near enough (their rodent 
reservoirs) to interact.

A cross-sectional serosurvey was conducted to as-
sess the proportion of persons exposed to hantaviruses in 
a virus-endemic area of the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. 
Findings of this study suggested the presence of >1 hanta-
viruses circulating in this region causing hantavirus pulmo-
nary syndrome, mild disease, or asymptomatic infection.
I
n Brazil, >1,080 cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome 
(HPS) have been conﬁ rmed since 1993 (case-fatality rate 
40%). More HPS cases (209) are reported in the state of 
Minas Gerais than in any other state in Brazil (M.L. Nunes, 
pers. comm.). In Minas Gerais, molecular studies identiﬁ ed 
a hantavirus called Araraquara virus associated with HPS 
cases. The wild rodent Necromys lasiurus (the hairy-tailed 
bolo mouse, also named Bolomys lasiurus) was implicated 
as a reservoir of this virus (1). Because asymptomatic in-
fection with hantaviruses also has been detected in Minas 
Gerais, we conducted a cross-sectional survey to assess the 
proportion of persons exposed to hantaviruses and to iden-
tify associated risk factors.
The Study
The hantavirus cross-sectional survey was carried 
out April through May 2006 in the municipality of Uber-
lândia, Minas Gerais, at an average altitude of 863 m 
(18º55′S,48º16′W) (Figure). A randomized and stratiﬁ ed 
(sex and age) sample was collected from the entire rural 
area and from the south sector of the municipality’s periur-
ban area. The term periurban refers to a residential area on 
the outskirts of the city that is in close contact with the rural 
area. The participants answered a questionnaire that includ-

among periurban residents, but the highest cumulative in-
cidence was among rural residents (Table 2). Nevertheless, 
rural and periurban areas did not differ signiﬁ cantly in ei-
ther prevalence or incidence. We found higher prevalence 
among rural residents (Table 2).
We screened serum samples by ELISA for hantavi-
rus-speciﬁ c immunoglobulin G using a recombinant an-
tigen of the nucleocapsid protein of Araraquara virus, 
produced in Escherichia coli and supplied by the Virus 
Research Unit of the University of São Paulo, Brazil, ac-
cording to the procedure previously described (2). All 
positive serum samples were retested; only those that had 
3 ELISA-positive results at >1:400 dilutions were consid-
ered positive.
The Mann-Whitney U and Fisher exact/binomial tests 
for 2 proportions were applied for comparison among me-
dians and proportions, respectively, using EPI INFO 3.3.2 
(www.cdc.gov/epiinfo) and BIOSTAT 5.0 (www.biostat.
org) software. Fisher exact test was used to estimate the 
odds ratio and 95% conﬁ dence intervals.
The 400 study participants comprised 200 rural and 
200 periurban residents ranging in age from 12 to 76 years 
(mean = 41 years). Twelve (3%) samples were hantavirus 
antibody-positive by ELISA. The 8 rural area antibody-
positive samples were from male farmers (Table 1). Pres-
ence of antibody was signiﬁ cantly associated with male 
sex, older age class, and potential risk activities (Table 1). 
Although all case-patients reported exposure to rodents 
or their excreta, this exposure was not statistically sig-
niﬁ cant (Table 1). In the periurban area, the presence of 
antibody was associated with age but not with sex, risk 
activity, or exposure to rodents (Table 1). The mean age 
of seropositive persons from periurban and rural areas 
was similar (p = 1.0). The relationship between antibody 
and sex depended on urban vs. rural residence (p = 0.02). 
Three antibody-positive persons in the rural zone and 2 
in the urban zone reported a history of pneumonia, albeit 
without complications.
We examined data from an HPS outbreak in Uberlândia 
during 1998–2005. The largest number of cases occurred 
Conclusions
Overall hantavirus antibody prevalence among periur-
ban residents was 2.0%, with a higher prevalence among 
women (2.6%). In previous studies, the prevalence of han-
tavirus antibodies was higher in men (4–6). All the positive 
samples in the rural area came from male farm workers. 
This ﬁ nding is similar to a situation reported in Colombia, 
where all positive samples came from men engaged in rural 
activities (6). These activities involve a high risk for infec-
tion by hantaviruses (7).
In this study, hantavirus positivity was found only in 
persons >39 years of age, and the difference in the mean 
age of the participants in relation to positivity was signiﬁ -
cant. This fact might suggest a historic high-risk event to 
which the older age class, but not the younger age class, 
was exposed.
High hantavirus antibody prevalence has been found 
in studies of some human populations in Latin America 
(5,8,9). The prevalence of Araraquara virus–reactive an-
tibodies among the volunteers in this study demonstrates 
that transmission is not rare, reinforcing the hypothesis of 
the existence of mild disease or asymptomatic infections 
(10). Two hypotheses have been proposed: clinically mild 
disease or inapparent infections might result from differ-
ences in the nature of exposure (e.g., low inoculum or inef-
ﬁ cient mechanism of transmission) or genetic differences 
in immune response to infection, or they might indicate the 
circulation of >1 hantavirus genotypes of greatly reduced 
virulence (10,11).

Bartonella

To determine additional reservoirs for Bartonella roch-
alimae, we examined samples from several wildlife spe-
cies. We isolated B. rochalimae from 1 red fox near Paris, 
France, and from 11 raccoons and 2 coyotes from Califor-
nia, USA. Co-infection with B. vinsonii subsp. berkhofﬁ i was 
documented in 1 of the coyotes.
T
welve Bartonella species/subspecies have been recog-
nized as zoonotic agents (1,2), including B. rochalimae 
isolated from a woman who had traveled from the United 
States to Peru before becoming ill with fever, splenomeg-
aly, mild anemia, and rash (3). B. rochalimae, previously 
described as a B. clarridgeiae–like organism, has also been 
isolated from rural domestic dogs and gray foxes (Uro-
cyon cinereoargenteus) from northern California (4,5). A 
case of fatal endocarditis in a domestic dog was associated 
with a B. clarridgeiae–like strain (6), later determined to 
be identical to B. rochalimae (5). Recently, B. rochalimae 
DNA was detected in a dog from Greece (7). High (43%) 
prevalence of bacteremia observed in gray foxes in Cali-
fornia suggests that they might act as a wildlife reservoir 
for this newly identiﬁ ed species. Furthermore, several B. 
clarridgeiae–like and B. rochalimae genes have been de-
tected in ﬂ eas collected from humans (8), rodents (9,10), 
red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) (11), and the environment in the 
Democratic Republic of Congo (12) during a plague out-
break. To determine whether other wildlife reservoirs ex-
ist, we tested samples from 3 additional wildlife species: 
coyotes, raccoons, and red foxes.

The Study
From 1996 through 1999 in central coastal California, 
21 Canis latrans coyotes (3 juveniles [<1 year of age] and 
18 adults) and 42 Procyon lotor raccoons (11 juveniles and 
31 adults) were trapped. In 2002, a blood sample was col-
lected from a road-killed red fox near Paris, France. All 
samples were collected in EDTA tubes and frozen at −70°C 
until plated on heart infusion agar containing 5% rabbit 
blood and incubated in 5% CO2 at 35°C for up to 4 weeks 
(13); subsequently, extracted DNA was tested for Barto-
nella spp. by PCR. In addition, from May 2003 through 
September 2004, blood was collected from 42 red foxes 
(23 females and 19 males; 2 kits [<1 year] and 40 adults) 
in Israel, and extracted DNA was tested for Bartonella spp. 
by PCR.
Bartonella isolates from 2 (9.5%) coyotes (coyote 
004 [7-month-old male] and coyote 22  [adult female cap-
tured in central California], which yielded 2 different-size 
colonies: coyote 22/sub1, large size; coyote 22/sub2, small 
size), 11 (26%) of the raccoons (7 adult females and 4 adult 
males), the 1 (100%) red fox from France, and DNA from 
the blood of 2 (5%) foxes from Israel were compared with 
B. rochalimae strains isolated from a human, rural dogs, 
and gray foxes. Bartonella isolates were analyzed by PCR 
restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) of the 
16S–23S intergenic transcribed spacer (ITS) region (all 
strains) and the gltA, rpoB and ftsZ genes (raccoons, gray 
foxes, coyotes, and dogs), as previously described (5). 
For the isolate from the red fox from France, extracted 
DNA was also ampliﬁ ed for fragments of the groEL gene 
by using the primer sets HSPps1, HSPps2, and HSPsp4 
(11,14). Sequencing was done in both directions by using 
a ﬂ uorescence-based automated sequencing system (Davis 
Sequencing, Davis, CA, USA). Sequences were imported 
into Vector NTI Suite 9.0 software (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, 
CA, USA) to obtain a consensus sequence. Align X in Vec-
tor NTI was used for aligning sequence variants with each 
other and other known Bartonella spp. for each of the 4 
genes. A neighbor-joining tree was constructed in MEGA 
version 3.0 (www.megasoftware.net) by concatenating the 
4 sequences. Bootstrap replicates were performed to esti-
mate node reliability of the phylogenetic tree; values were 
obtained from 1,000 randomly selected samples of the 
aligned sequence data. Sequence data for the groEL gene of 
the isolate from the fox in France (GenBank accession no. 
FJ545656) was compared with sequences of DNA extract-
ed from ﬂ eas collected on 4 foxes from Hungary (11) and 
deposited in GenBank under accession no. DQ522300.
Ampliﬁ ed PCR products were obtained from the ITS 
region and the gltA, rpoB, and ftsZ genes of all isolates. 
Isolates from coyote 004 and coyote 22/sub2, the red fox 
from France, and the 11 raccoons had identical RFLP pro-
ﬁ les, also identical to those observed in the rural dogs and

According to PCR results and comparison of a 571-
bp sequence ampliﬁ ed from the ITS region, the sequences 
from 2 foxes (1 male, 1 female) from 2 villages in northern 
Israel were identical to each other and to that from the fox 
from France (Figure 2). Differences of 2–5 bp were ob-
served among ITS region sequences when comparing those 
from the foxes from Israel and France with those from B. 
rochalimae from gray foxes and raccoons from California. 
When the groEL partial sequence FJ545656 from the red 
fox from France was compared with sequence DQ522300 
from a Pulex irritans ﬂ ea collected from foxes from Hunga-
ry, the 156-bp fragment (based on the consensus sequence 
from both directions) from the red fox from France was 
100% identical to that of the ﬂ ea.
gray foxes from California (5). Isolate sub1 from coyote 
22 had banding patterns identical to those of Bartonella 
vinsonii subsp. berkhofﬁ i (American Type Culture Col-
lection 51672), indicating co-infection with B. vinsonii 
subsp. berkhofﬁ i and B. rochalimae. Consensus sequenc-
es were obtained for isolates from all coyotes and the red 
fox from France. Because the RFLP proﬁ les for the 11 
raccoon isolates were identical, only 2 isolates (from rac-
coons 60 and 75, adult females from central California) 
were selected for sequencing and were identical for all 
genes. Partial sequences from the 4 genes were identi-
cal for the isolates from coyote 004 and the 2 raccoons. 
These isolates were 100% similar to a strain recovered 
from the dog with endocarditis (GenBank accession nos. 
DQ676488–DQ676491) (5,6). The B. rochalimae isolate 
sub2 from coyote 22 was identical to isolates from rural 
dogs and gray foxes from northern California (accession 
nos. DQ676484–DQ676487). Similarity of isolates from 
these regions ranged from 99.5% to 100% (Tables 1,2). 
A tree constructed from the merged set of concatenated 
sequences (Figure 1) demonstrates that isolate sub2 from 
coyote 22 clustered with isolates from the dog and gray 
fox from northern California; those from coyote 004 
and raccoon 60 grouped with those from the dog with 
endocarditis.
Conclusions
We report the isolation or detection of B. rochalimae 
from red foxes, raccoons, and coyotes from North America, 
Europe, and the Middle East. Sequence analysis of 4 genes 
identiﬁ ed small variations in the B. rochalimae isolates 
from these different geographic regions. A relatively high 
percentage (26%) of raccoons had B. rochalimae bacter-
emia compared with only 9.5% (2/21) coyotes. A previous 
study found that of 109 coyotes, none were infected with 
B. rochalimae, but 31 (28%) harbored B. vinsonii subsp.

berkhofﬁ i (13). In raccoons, bacteremia was found in adults 
only, which is surprising because for all animals in general, 
Bartonella spp. bacteremia is detected more frequently in 
younger animals (1). Gray foxes from northern California 
had B. rochalimae bacteremia prevalence of 42% (4), sug-
gesting that gray foxes and raccoons could be natural res-
ervoirs of B. rochalimae in California and that infection 
of coyotes and domestic dogs could result from occasional 
spillover. Co-infection of a coyote also illustrates that wild 
canids can simultaneously harbor >1 species of Bartonella. 
Co-infection of humans with B. henselae and B. vinsonii 
subsp. berkhofﬁ i has also been reported (15). Additionally, 
co-infection with 2 zoonotic Bartonella species in this coy-
ote raises the possibility that humans and domestic dogs 
could also be co-infected with these species, making appro-
priate diagnosis more difﬁ cult. Pulex ﬂ eas collected on red 
foxes from Hungary (11) were indeed infected with a strain 
of Bartonella that was identical, at least for the groEL par-
tial sequence, with that of the isolate from the red fox from 
France, suggesting that red foxes from central Europe may 
also be infected with B. rochalimae. Future studies with 
larger sample sizes will be needed to better deﬁ ne the role

CTX-M 
β-Lactamase 
Production and 
Virulence of 
Escherichia coli K1

and Richard Bonnet
We report a patient with neonatal meningitis caused by 
a CTX-M-1–producing Escherichia coli K1 strain. The inﬂ u-
ence of CTX-M production on virulence was investigated 
in cell culture and a newborn mouse model of meningitis. 
CTX-M production had no inﬂ uence on virulence but was a 
major factor in clinical outcome.
E
scherichia coli is the second most common cause 
of neonatal meningitis. Neonatal meningitis E. coli 
(NMEC) belong mainly to phylogenetic group B2 and har-
bor numerous virulence factors (1).
Since the beginning of the 21st century, an explosive 
spread of CTX-M–type extended-spectrum β-lactamases 
(ESBLs) in E. coli has occurred (2). These enzymes con-
fer resistance to nearly all β-lactam antimicrobial drugs, 
including third-generation cephalosporins, the ﬁ rst-line 
treatment for patients with serious E. coli infections. How-
ever, CTX-M–type ESBLs have been observed mainly in 
E. coli strains with few virulence factors or in strains caus-
ing minor infections (3–5). In addition, bacterial resistance 
to antimicrobial drugs is frequently reported as difﬁ cult to 
reconcile with bacterial virulence (6). Highly pathogenic 
E. coli such as NMEC are therefore considered susceptible 
to antimicrobial drugs (7). We report a clinical case of neo-
natal meningitis caused by CTX-M–producing NMEC and 
the inﬂ uence of CTX-M production on virulence. 
The Study
In April 2007, a 39-year-old pregnant woman with am-
niotic sac rupture was admitted to a hospital in Orleans, 
France, at 28 weeks and 4 days of gestation. Treatment 
Author afﬁ liations: University of Auvergne, Clermont-Ferrand, 
France (D. Dubois, R. Bonnet); Teaching Hospital, Clermont-
Ferrand (D. Dubois, R. Bonnet); Childrens Hospital, Los Angeles, 
California, USA (N.V. Prasadarao, R. Mittal); University of Southern 
California, Los Angeles (N.V. Prasadarao); and La Source Hospital, 
Orléans, France (L. Bret, M. Roujou-Gris)
was started with betamethasone (12 mg 1×/d) for fetal lung 
maturation and amoxicillin (1g 3×/d) for 4 days. Because of 
a high serum level of C-reactive protein, antimicrobial drug 
therapy was switched to amoxicillin with clavulanic acid 
(1g 3×/d) for 1 day. A cesarean delivery was performed at 
29 weeks and 2 days of gestation. A lumbar puncture sam-
ple of the low-weight (1,560 g) newborn female was tinged 
with blood. Cerebrospinal ﬂ uid (CSF) protein and glucose 
values were 4.00 g/L and 3.5 mmol/L, respectively. Results 
of CSF Gram staining were negative.
The infant was admitted to the neonatal critical care 
unit and received amoxicillin (150 mg), cefotaxime (120 
mg), and netilmicin (8 mg) 2×/d for 2 days. Culture of pla-
centa, maternal and infant blood, and infant gastric ﬂ uid 
yielded E. coli. The isolate was resistant to antimicrobial 
drugs, including third-generation cephalosporins. Imipen-
em/cilastatin (25 mg 4×/d) and amikacin (15 mg 2×/d) were 
given for 2 days. Treatment with imipenem/cilastatin was 
given for 15 days and then stopped because of the infant’s 
clinical improvement and return of C-reactive protein to 
the reference level. Similar drug treatment was adminis-
trated to the mother.
One week after drug treatment was discontinued, the 
infant showed signs of septicemia. A second lumbar punc-
ture sample had protein and glucose levels of 4.56 g/L and 
0.1 mmol/L, respectively, and a leukocyte count of 4,700 
cells/μL (54% polymorphonuclear cells). E. coli were iso-
lated from blood and CSF cultures and showed a resistance 
pattern identical to that of the previous isolate. Meningitis 
was a complication of the initial sepsis or a relapse of initial 
unapparent meningitis (8).
Treatment was started with imipenem/cilastatin (30 
mg 4×/d) for 25 days and amikacin (15 mg 2×/d) for 5 days. 
Because the infant had a seizure, phenobarbital (22.5 mg) 
and ciproﬂ oxacin (15 mg 2×/d) were prescribed for 5 ad-
ditional days. Her condition gradually improved and blood 
and CSF values returned to reference levels. The infant was 
discharged from the hospital 1 month later and treatment 
with the anticonvulsant was discontinued. She showed 
normal psychomotor development at a regular follow-up 
pediatric visit.
E. coli strains isolated from the mother and infant 
were indistinguishable by enterobacterial repetitive in-
tergenic consensus sequence 2 PCR, random ampliﬁ ed 
polymorphic DNA analysis, and typing with a MALDI 
BioTyper (Bruker Daltonique, Wissembourg, France) 
(9). Thus, the isolates corresponded to the same strain, 
designated Orl-1. PCR-based phylogenetic analysis and 
serotyping showed that the strain belonged to group B2 
and serotype O7:K1:H7, a major O antigen encountered 
worldwide in NMEC (1).
Resistance of the Orl-1 strain (MICs 128 μg/mL for 
cefotaxime and 8 μg/mL for ceftazidime) was caused by

Mice with E44- and Orl-1–induced neonatal menin-
gitis were treated with the third-generation cephalosporin 
cefotaxime, as recommended for humans. Despite antimi-
crobial drug treatment, Orl-1, but not strain E44, caused 
meningitis, suggesting that drug resistance is a major factor 
in clinical outcomes.
Conclusions
Studies have reported emergence of E. coli as the pre-
dominant organisms responsible for sepsis at any gesta-
tional age and for increased rates of drug-resistant E. coli 
caused by intrapartum drug prophylaxis (12). Spread of 
ESBLs in E. coli and intrapartum exposure to antimicrobial 
drugs may favor emergence of NMEC strains resistant to 
third-generation cephalosporins.
Two other well-characterized E. coli K1 strains pro-
ducing ESBLs have been isolated from patients with neo-
natal meningitis in Algeria and France. The ESBL was 
identiﬁ ed as CTX-M-15 in both patients, and 1 infection 
was lethal (13,14). Other putative ESBL-producing E. coli 
K1 have been recently isolated, especially in developing 
countries (15).
Emergence of ESBL-producing E. coli strains, which 
are frequently resistant to ﬂ uoroquinolone (2), highlights 
the need for possible alternatives to third-generation ce-
the gene encoding CTX-M-1. This strain was also resis-
tant to tetracycline, trimethoprim, and sulfamethoxazole 
and susceptible to cefoxitin, imipenem, aminoglycosides, 
quinolones, chloramphenicol, and fosfomycin. It harbored 
the major E. coli genes associated with neonatal meningitis 
(Table 1) (1,10).
Plasmids from Orl-1 were used to transform E. coli 
K-12 DH5α. Three resistance proﬁ les that enabled detec-
tion of 3 plasmids were obtained. On the basis of screening 
of plasmid transformants and Orl-1, most virulence factors 
genes were presumably chromosomally encoded. Three 
virulence factors (aer, iss, and a second copy of iroN) were 
mediated by a tetracycline-resistant, large (≈180 kb), con-
jugative plasmid (pOrl-1-Te). The 2 other plasmids were 
pOrl-1-CTX-M-1, the CTX-M-1–encoding large (≈150 
kb) conjugative plasmid carrying resistance to trimethop-
rim and sulfamethoxazole, and pOrl-1-TEM-1, a TEM–1-
encoding small (<40 kb) plasmid.
A derivative strain that did not harbor the 3 plasmids 
(Orl-c) was obtained by plasmid elimination with ethidium 
bromide. Orl-1, Orl-c, and E. coli DH5α harboring pOrl-1-
CTX-M-1 were tested for invasiveness in human brain mi-
crovascular endothelial cells (10) and in a newborn mouse 
(C57BL/6 wild-type) model of meningitis (R. Mittal et 
al., unpub. data) to investigate the inﬂ uence of CTX-M-1 
production on virulence. E. coli strain E44, a rifampicin-
resistant mutant of archetypical NMEC K1 strain RS218, 
was used as a positive control (10).
Orl-1 and Orl-c strains exhibited 3.5× lower inva-
siveness than strain E44. However, their ability to invade 
human brain microvascular endothelial cells was 400× 
higher than that of strain DH5α–CTX-M1. In the mouse 
model, DH5α–CTX-M1 did not cause bacteremia or men-
ingitis. In contrast, Orl-1, Orl-c, and E44 induced menin-
gitis (prevalences of 100%, 84%, and 85%, respectively) 
(Table 2). 
The difference between Orl-1 and Orl-c in the mouse 
model may be explained by loss of plasmid pOrl-1-Te from 
Orl-c. Plasmid pOrl-1-Te is likely similar to pS88-related 
plasmids of NMEC because they share 3 virulence factor 
genes (iss, aer, and iroN) and are large and conjugative. 
These plasmids contribute to virulence of NMEC (11). 
Orl-1 and Orl-c showed similar behaviors, which suggest-
ed that the CTX-M-1–encoding plasmid pOrl-1-CTX-M-1 
does not alter virulence of the strain.

phalosporins for treatment of patients with infected with 
NMEC. Carbapenems are usually recommended for treat-
ment of infections with ESBL-producing E. coli (2). How-
ever, this case report shows the role of treatment duration 
and the need for additional pharmacokinetic and safety 
studies in neonates and for adjunctive therapies (8).
This characterization of a CTX-M-1–producing NMEC 
strain highlights the emergence of CTX-M–type ESBL in 
highly virulent E. coli. Because of worldwide spread of 
CTX-Ms, caution should be exercised in the management 
of patients with NMEC, and ﬁ rst-line treatment for neona-
tal meningitis may need to be reconsidered.

Ehrlichia 
chaffeensis 
Infection of Sika 
Deer, Japan

To determine whether Ehrlichia chaffeensis exists in 
Japan, we used PCR to examine blood from sika deer in 
Nara, Japan. Of 117 deer, 36 (31%) were infected with E. 
chaffeensis. The E. chaffeensis 16S rRNA base and GroEL 
amino acid sequences from Japan were most closely re-
lated to those of E. chaffeensis Arkansas.
H
uman infection with Ehrlichia chaffeensis causes hu-
man monocytic ehrlichiosis (HME), an inﬂ uenza-like 
illness. Severity of the disease varies from mild to severe 
and can even cause death (1). HME cases have been report-
ed primarily in the southeastern and south–central regions 
of the United States (1). 
The organism, E. chaffeensis, until recently has been 
reported only in the United States; however, numerous re-
ports now indicate that Ehrlichiae spp. closely related or 
identical to E. chaffeensis exist throughout the world (1,2). 
In the United States, E. chaffeensis has been most frequent-
ly identiﬁ ed in the lone star tick (Amblyomma americanum) 
(3). E. chaffeensis DNA has also been detected in A. testu-
dinarium and Haemaphysalis yeni ticks from southern Peo-
ple’s Republic of China (4), in H. longicornis ticks from 
South Korea (5), and in A. parvum ticks in Argentina (6). 
Other than A. americanum, the role of these tick species as 
E. chaffeensis vectors has not been investigated. The white-
tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) is the only vertebrate 
species currently recognized as a complete and sufﬁ cient 
host for maintaining the transmission cycle of E. chaffeen-
sis (3,7). To look for molecular evidence of E. chaffeensis 
in sika deer (Cervus nippon) in Japan, we examined blood 
specimens by using PCR ampliﬁ cation of the 16S rRNA 
and groEL genes.

The Study
In Nara, Japan, to prevent injuries to park visitors, the 
Foundation for the Protection of Sika Deer in Nara Park 
captured 97 pregnant female sika deer in April 2005 and 
20 male sika deer with antlers in November 2005. Blood 
specimens were collected from all 117 deer, and buffy coat 
fractions were stored at –80°C for further analysis. Genom-
ic DNA was extracted from the buffy coat fractions by us-
ing a QIAamp tissue kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA, USA). 
Nested PCR ampliﬁ cation of genomic DNA was performed 
by using primer pairs designed to amplify the E. chaffeen-
sis 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene and the E. chaffeensis 
groEL gene (Table). 
Of the 117 specimens, 36 (31%) yielded E. chaffeen-
sis 16S rRNA ampliﬁ cation products and 35 (30%) yielded 
E. chaffeensis groEL ampliﬁ cation products. Of 36 16S 
rRNA–positive specimens, 33 were positive for groEL 
(92% concordance rate). Of 35 groEL-positive specimens, 
33 were positive for 16S rRNA (94% concordance rate). 
The E. chaffeensis sequences were conserved in that all se-
quences obtained from sika deer in Nara were nearly identi-
cal to those of a representative strain that we named NS101 
and submitted to GenBank (accession no. AB454074). 
The sequence of the 16S rRNA gene from E. chaffeensis 
NS101 was most closely related (99.6% identity; 5 bases 
of 1,333 bp that can be aligned for comparison differed) to 
that of 5 human isolates: Arkansas (GenBank accession no. 
M73222) (8), Sapulpa (U60476) (9), 91HE17 (U23503) 
(10), St. Vincent (U86665) (11), and Jax (U86664) (11); 
the next closest sequence was from an E. chaffeensis isolate 
from A. testudinarium ticks in China (GenBank accession 
no. AF147752) (99.2% identity; 10 bases of 1,333 bp that 
can be aligned for comparison differed). 
When E. chaffeensis NS101 was compared with Ehrli-
chia spp. previously identiﬁ ed in Japan, the sequence of the 
16S rRNA gene (a 1,328-bp segment that can be aligned for 
comparison) of E. chaffeensis NS101 was 98.9%, 98.9%, 
and 98.6% identical to that of E. muris AS145 strain, Eh-
rlichia sp. HF565 (the HF strain, Ixodes ovatus Ehrlichia) 
and Candidatus Ehrlichia shimanensis TS37, respectively. 
Phylogenic analysis concurred with the observation that E. 
chaffeensis from Nara sika deer has the highest identity to 
the E. chaffeensis human isolates from the United States 
(Figure 1).
Although longer 16S rRNA gene sequences are desir-
able for strain comparison, the sequence of the 16S rRNA 
gene of E. chaffeensis from H. longicornis ticks in Korea 
(GenBank accession no. AY350424, 390 bp) and from 
A. parvum ticks in Argentina (GenBank accession no. 
EU826516, 470 bp) were identical to a corresponding, but 
incomplete, segment (358 bp and 402 bp, respectively) of 
the 16S rRNA gene of E. chaffeensis NS101 and Arkan-
sas strains. An Ehrlichia sp. was detected in blood samples

Conclusions
On the basis of the long 16S rRNA and the groEL 
DNA sequences, our study demonstrates the presence of E. 
chaffeensis in sika deer from Nara, Japan. The genetic simi-
larity of E. chaffeensis in the sika deer in Japan to strains 
isolated from HME patients in the United States raises the 
possibility that HME may exist in Japan. Of 1,803 serum 
samples collected from persons in metropolitan Tokyo 
from 1991 through 1995, when E. muris was used as anti-
gen, 20 were seropositive (13). Because E. chaffeensis and 
E. muris antigens are highly cross-reactive (14), some of 
these persons might have been infected with E. chaffeensis. 
Of the 10 tick species found on sika deer (15), the primary 
tick species found on sika deer in Nara is H. longicornis, 
which is known to bite humans in Japan and to be infected 
with E. chaffeensis in South Korea (5). Because sika deer 
are abundant and increasing throughout Japan (16), this 
ﬁ nding highlights need to survey sika deer and humans in 
Japan for E. chaffeensis infection.

from marsh deer (Blastocerus dichotomus) captured near 
the Parana River in southeast Brazil in 1998 (12). However, 
the 16S rRNA sequence from these marsh deer (GenBank 
accession no. DQ345720, 383 bp) shares 98.7% identity 
to a corresponding, but incomplete, segment (381 bp) of 
the E. chaffeensis NS101 and Arkansas strains. Because the 
sequences of the corresponding segments of Ehrlichia sp. 
HF565 and ‘Candidatus Ehrlichia shimanensis’ TS37 both 
had 99.0% identity to that of E. chaffeensis Arkansas strain, 
higher than the 98.7%, the Ehrlichia sp. in marsh deer from 
Brazil might not be E. chaffeensis.
Among the E. chaffeensis groEL sequences available 
in current databases, only that from E. chaffeensis Arkan-
sas has >1,000 bp for reliable comparison. The groEL DNA 
sequence (1,208 bp that can be aligned) of the NS101 strain 
(GenBank accession no. AB454077, 1,311 bp) was most 
closely related to that of E. chaffeensis Arkansas (Gen-
Bank accession no. L10917), followed by the Ehrlichia sp. 
HF565 strain (GenBank accession no. AB032712), and the 
E. muris AS145 strain (GenBank accession no. AF210459) 
(Figure 2). The deduced E. chaffeensis NS101 GroEL ami-
no acid sequence (402 residues) was most closely related 
(99.5% identity) to that of E. chaffeensis Arkansas, fol-
lowed by the Ehrlichia sp. HF565 strain (99.2% identity) 
and E. muris AS145 strain (99.0%).

We developed a speciﬁ c and rapid detection system for 
Rickettsia japonica and R. heilongjiangensis, the causative 
agents of spotted fever, using a TaqMan minor groove bind-
er probe for a particular open reading frame (ORF) identi-
ﬁ ed by the R. japonica genome project. The target ORF was 
present only in R. japonica–related strains.
R
ickettsia, a genus that includes the causative agents for 
spotted fever rickettsioses and typhus fever, comprises 
obligate intracellular bacteria (1). The ﬁ rst case of Japa-
nese spotted fever (JSF), caused by R. japonica (2), was 
reported in 1984 in Japan (3). According to the national 
surveillance system in Japan (http://idsc.nih.go.jp/idwr/
ybata/report-Ea.html), JSF cases, including sporadic cases 
resulting in death, have been gradually increasing. Rapid 
diagnosis of rickettsial infections is important because rick-
ettsioses can be cured when appropriate antimicrobial drug 
treatment is given during the early clinical stages of the 
disease. Furthermore, development of a rapid and speciﬁ c 
diagnostic system for R. japonica is now a matter of in-
creasing urgency (4) because JSF has also been reported in 
several other countries in Asia (1).
The Study
Since 1998, thirteen complete Rickettsia genome 
sequences have been reported (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
Genbank/index.html). In addition, the National Center 
for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) genome project 
for R. japonica strain YH has recently concluded (proj-
ect ID 38487). Results of this project show speciﬁ c DNA 
regions for R. japonica in the Rickettsia genome. One of 
these regions includes a 216-bp open reading frame (ORF) 
(GenBank accession no. AB437281). On the basis of in-

formation from this genome project, we performed DNA 
sequencing for this 216-bp ORF to determine whether the 
speciﬁ c DNA sequences are conserved in all R. japonica 
strains and other closely related strains, including R. hei-
longjiangensis (5) and Rickettsia sp. LON (6).
R. heilongjiangensis is also a causative agent of spot-
ted fever in northeastern Asia and has been classiﬁ ed with-
in the R. japonica group (5). Several studies have reported 
that Rickettsia. sp. LON strains also have similar sequences 
to R. japonica. Our PCR can easily distinguish Rickettsia 
sp. LON strains (LON-2, LON-9, and LON-13) from R. 
japonica strains. This test can help in the diagnosis because 
Rickettsia sp. LON strains have only been isolated from 
ticks and may not be pathogenic in humans (6).
DNA sequencing was performed by using an ABI 
PRISM BigDye Terminator version 3.1 Kit (Applied 
Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) with an ABI 3130 
sequence detector. DNA sequences were aligned by 
ClustalW software (http://clustalw.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/top-e.
html) with an open gap penalty of 15, a gap extension 
penalty of 6.66, a gap distance of 8, and a maximum di-
vision penalty of 40. For determination of the DNA se-
quence for the 216-bp ORF, the primer pair of JapoSP5′ 
(5′-ACAACATCAATATTATAATTAGTATCC-3′) and 
JapoSP3′ (5′-TTCACGTATGTCTATATATGCTGCAG
CG-3′) was used to amplify a 564-bp section, including 
this ORF, because this unique DNA sequence was located 
as the inserted sequence of the homolog for R. conorii 
RC1338 (Figure, panel A).
The nucleotide sequence of this ORF was identical 
among 5 of the R. japonica strains: DT-1, YH, FLA-1, 
HH-8, and HH-9 (100%); the sequence was highly con-
served with signiﬁ cant identity in R. heilongjiangensis 
(99.5%), except for the Rickettsia sp. LON strains (92.1%; 
Figure, panel B). This 216-bp ORF had been previously 
applied to BLAST searches with NCBI blast (nblast) for 
humans, mice, and others (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
Blast.cgi). The results showed that no similar ORF had 
been reported to date. Therefore, we focused on this con-
served region of the 216-bp ORF to develop a TaqMan mi-
nor groove binder (MGB) probe (Applied Biosystems) that 
could detect the pathogenic R. japonica group, including R. 
heilongjiangensis, with a high degree of speciﬁ city.
Oligonucleotide primers (SpRija5′ and SPRija3′) and 
the TaqMan MGB probe (SpRijaMGB) were designed 
by using Primer Express software version 2.0 (Applied 
Biosystems Figure, panel B). The detection probe was la-
beled with the ﬂ uorescent reporter FAM (carboxyﬂ uores-
cein labeling) at the 5′ end; the nonﬂ uorescent quencher 
and MGB were labeled at the 3′ end (Figure, panel B). 
The detection sequence (shown as a bold line in Figure 
1, panel B) was registered in GenBank (accession no. 
AB437281).

Diagnostic Assay for Rickettsia japonica
Figure. Unique DNA sequence in the Rickettsia japonica genome that 
analyzed PCR in this study. A) Comparative genome map of the 216-
bp open reading frame (ORF). The R. japonica–speciﬁ c sequence 
region (AB437281) in the R. japonica genome and the complete 
genome sequence of R. conorii strain Malish 7 were compared. 
The RC1338 DNA sequence and the mapping position data for R. 
conorii were obtained from the Rickettsia genome database (www.
igs.cnrs-mrs.fr/mgdb/Rickettsia). Two solid black arrows indicate 
primer positions; this region was ampliﬁ ed and sequenced with the 
same primers. B) Alignments of R. japonica–speciﬁ c 216-bp ORF 
(AB437281) between R. japonica YH, R. heilongjiangensis CH8-1, 
and Rickettsia sp. LON, as performed by the program ClustalW 
(www.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw), and the positions of primers and probe in 
real-time PCR. Primer positions and directions (black arrows) and 
the TaqMan minor groove binder (MGB) (line) probe position are 
shown. The 216-bp ORF of R. heilongjiangensis and Rickettsia sp. 
LON were registered on GenBank with accession nos. AB512783 
and AB512784, respectively. DNA sequences are identical among 
R. japonica strains and Rickettsia sp. LON strains (astericks). The 
alignment was edited with BioEdit version 7.0.0 (www.mbio.ncsu.
edu/BioEdit/bioedit.html).
Real-time PCR was performed by using an ABI 7500 
system (Applied Biosystems). DNA polymerase (perfect 
real-time PCR) for the PCR was obtained from Takara Bio 
(Kyoto, Japan). A 20-μL sample was added to each well 
of a 96-well microplate (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁ c Inc., 
Waltham, MA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s in-
structions. Thermal cycle protocol was performed as fol-
lows: ﬁ rst incubation stage, 20 s at 95°C; second stage, 5 s 
at 95°C and 34 s at 60°C. The second stage was repeated 45 
times. For analysis of real-time PCR, the threshold line was 
ﬁ xed at 0.2 to avoid detection of nonspeciﬁ c ﬂ uorescence. 
This detection procedure can be completed within 1 h.
The reactivity of this assay was examined by using 
various copy numbers of synthetic R. japonica DNA frag-
ments that were ampliﬁ ed by the primer pairs JapoSP5′ and 
JapoSP3′ within the R. japonica genome. Genomic DNA of 
R. japonica strain YH was prepared from cultivated bacte-
ria according to methods proposed by Furuya et al. (7). A 
calibration curve was generated with 5 calibrators, ranging 
from 102 to 109 copies/well in triplicate. We found a linear 
correlation (R>0.99) between the detection cycle numbers 
and R. japonica DNA copy numbers from 102 to 109 copies/
reaction (data not shown).
A total of 26 rickettsial strains, classiﬁ ed into 11 spe-
cies, were used in this study (Table 1). Speciﬁ cities for this 
TaqMan PCR are also summarized in Table 1. Genomic 
DNA of R. prowazekii and R. rickettsii were prepared from 
antigen slides (Panbio Inc., Sinnamon Park, Queensland, 
Australia) by using a Gentra Puregene kit (QIAGEN, 
Valencia, CA, USA). Genomic DNA of other Rickettsia 
strains was also prepared from cultivated bacteria accord-
ing to methods proposed by Furuya et al. (7). 
Our results showed that this novel assay could detect 
all 5 R. japonica strains and 1 R. heilongjiangensis strain 
used in this study. However, it could not detect R. rickettsii, 
R. prowazekii, or other Rickettsia strains. These results in-
dicate that the combination of probes and primers in this 
study had high speciﬁ city for the pathogenic R. japonica 
group. Nonspeciﬁ c reactions were not observed when ge-
nomic DNA from human or murine ﬁ broblasts was used in 
any of the assays (data not shown).
The detection limits of this PCR were compared to 
those of conventional PCRs by using serially diluted ge-
nomic DNA. The conventional PCRs, designated as 
Rj5-Rj10 and R1-R2 assays, were designed to detect the 
17-kDa antigen gene of Rickettsia, by using a primer 
set of Rj5 (5′-CGCCATTCTACGTTACTACC-3′) and 
Rj10 (5′-ATTCTAAAAACCATATACTG-3′) (7) and 
R1 (5′-TCAATTCACAACTTGCCATT-3′) and R2 (5′-
TTTACAAAATTCTAAAAACC-3′) (15), respectively. 
Since 1996, these assays have been used for molecular 
diagnosis of JSF in clinical laboratories in Japan. Recent 
studies have suggested that a TaqMan PCR assay may be 
as much as 100× more sensitive than these assays (data not 
shown). Therefore, in our study, the TaqMan PCR was as-
sumed to be much more sensitive than the conventional as-
says that are known to show false-negative results, even for 
a patient with acute-stage JSF.
We requested clinical samples to verify the validity of 
our assay. Eighteen DNA templates were extracted from 
blood clots collected from 18 patients in the acute stages 
of illness (male:female ratio 1:1; average age 64.1 years 
[range 27–88 years]); average number of days after onset

of fever 4.6 [range 2–7 days; Table 2]). These templates 
were reexamined by using our TaqMan PCR. Although the 
conventional assays could not detect the presence of any 
Rickettsia DNA, 9 of 18 samples displayed positive results 
with the TaqMan PCR (Table 2). The blood clot from the 
patient in whom Scrub typhus disease was previously diag-
nosed was used as a negative control in this real-time PCR 
assay, resulted were not detected. Our TaqMan PCR is cur-
rently available to clinical laboratories that need to rule out 
false-negative results in molecular diagnoses.
Conclusions
JSF is a threat to public health in Japan. Our results 
suggest that an R. japonica–speciﬁ c 216-bp ORF may have 
been conserved throughout the R. japonica species and 
closely related Rickettsia spp. The newly developed real-
time PCR system, which demonstrated a high level of sen-
sitivity and speciﬁ city, may be a useful tool for laboratory 
diagnosis.

Novel Lineage of 
Methicillin-Resistant 
Staphylococcus 
aureus, Hong Kong
Luca Guardabassi, Margie O’Donoghue, 
Arshnee Moodley, Jeff Ho, and Maureen Boost
To determine whether spa type of methicillin-resistant 
Staphylococcus aureus in pigs belonged to sequence type 
(ST) 398, we analyzed nasal swabs from pig carcasses at 
Hong Kong markets in 2008. ST9 belonging to spa type 
t899 was found for 16/100 samples, which indicates that a 
distinct lineage has emerged in pigs.
M
ethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) 
has long been recognized as an important hospital 
pathogen and in recent years has emerged in the commu-
nity. Increasing numbers of reports have concerned MRSA 
in animals. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) has shown 
widespread dissemination of sequence type (ST) 398 among 
pigs in the Netherlands (1). This MRSA lineage has subse-
quently been reported in several other countries and animal 
species. Compelling microbiologic and epidemiologic evi-
dence indicates that persons living or working on farms, es-
pecially pig farms, have an increased risk for colonization 
or infection with ST398 (2). In the present study, MRSA 
isolates obtained from slaughtered pigs in Hong Kong were 
characterized genotypically and compared with ST398.
The Study
Nasal swab specimens collected by using Transwabs 
(Medical Wire Ltd, Corsham, UK) were collected from 100 
pig carcasses at 2 wet markets in Hong Kong on 5 separate 
days over a 7-week period in 2008. Cross-contamination 
was minimized by selecting carcasses with intact nasopha-
ryngeal tracts and by instructing the butchers taking part 
in the project to avoid causing damage to the nares when 
cutting up the heads. The frontal section of each snout was 
cleaned with 75% alcohol before swabbing the nasal mu-
cosa up to 8 cm into the nares. Nasal swabs were enriched 
in brain–heart infusion broth (Oxoid Ltd, Basingstoke, UK) 
with 7% NaCl at 37oC for 48 h and then injected into man-
Author afﬁ liations: University of Copenhagen, Frederiksberg C, 
Denmark (L. Guardabassi, A. Moodley); and The Hong Kong Poly-
technic University, Hung Hom, Kowloon, Hong Kong Special Ad-
ministrative Region, People’s Republic of China (M. O’Donoghue, 
J. Ho, M. Boost)
nitol salt agar (Oxoid) supplemented with 6 μg/mL oxacil-
lin, for 24 h. Presumptive S. aureus colonies were tested 
for heat-stable nuclease (DNase) and coagulase production, 
and isolates positive for both were conﬁ rmed to the species 
level by latex agglutination (Staphaurex Plus, Murex Diag-
nostics Ltd, Dartford, UK). Antimicrobial drug sensitivity 
testing was performed by using disk diffusion following 
Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute recommenda-
tions (3). Methicillin resistance was conﬁ rmed by disk dif-
fusion using cefoxitin (30 μg) and mecA PCR detection. 
All MRSA isolates were characterized by pulsed-ﬁ eld gel 
electrophoresis (PFGE) by using SmaI (4), staphylococcal 
chromosome cassette (SCC) mec typing (5), and spa typing 
(6) with Ridom StaphType 1.4.1 software (www.ridom.de/
staphtype). Two isolates representative of distinct PFGE 
patterns and SCCmec types were analyzed by MLST (7), 
and the remaining isolates were characterized by single-
locus (aroE) sequencing.
MRSA was isolated from 16 samples collected on 4 of 
the 5 sampling days. In contrast to ST398, which has the 
characteristic of being nontypeable by PFGE using SmaI 
(1,2), the 16 MRSA isolates were typeable. They displayed 
6 PFGE patterns; 2 predominant types (A1 and B1) were as-
sociated with SCCmec types IV and V, respectively (Table 
1). Both PFGE types were ST9 according to MLST analy-
sis. The 4 remaining patterns were either closely related to 
A1 (A2, A3, and A4) or possibly related to B1 (B2) accord-
ing to the criteria of Tenover et al. (8). All isolates belonged 
to spa type t899 and harbored the ST9-associated aroE al-
lele 3, which differs from that in ST398 (allele 35) by mul-
tiple mutations. Porcine MRSA ST9 isolates were negative 
for Panton-Valentine leukocidin genes and resistant to a 
broader range of antimicrobial agents than that previously 
described for MRSA ST398 isolated from pigs in the Neth-
erlands (1). Twelve isolates displayed a typical multiple 
resistance pattern, including resistance to chloramphenicol, 
ciproﬂ oxacin, clindamycin, cotrimoxazole, erythromycin, 
gentamicin, and tetracyline. The remaining 4 isolates were 
additionally resistant to fusidic acid (Table 1). All isolates 
were negative for Panton-Valentine leukocidin and suscep-
tible to vancomycin and linezolid.
A search of the scientiﬁ c literature and the Internet for 
information about the frequency of S. aureus ST9 in hu-
mans and animals indicated that ST9 is a clone of porcine 
origin. In 2005, Armand-Lefevre et al. (9) reported that ST9 
was the most prevalent ST of methicillin-susceptible S. au-
reus (MSSA) isolated from pig farmers and infected pigs 
in France but not from a control group of persons without 
occupational contact with pigs. In 2007, an erythromycin-
resistant MSSA ST9 clone belonging to spa type 337 was 
found to be endemic on a farm in Denmark (10). A clini-
cal ST9 isolate of porcine origin carrying the multidrug re-
sistance gene cfr, associated with linezolid resistance, has

have resulted from either convergent evolution or genetic 
recombination.
Conclusions
Our study of MRSA colonization of commercial pigs 
in Asia provides evidence that methicillin resistance has 
emerged in a porcine S. aureus lineage other than ST398. 
It appears that ST9 has achieved methicillin resistance 
through multiple acquisitions of SCCmec, as indicated by 
the recovery of distinct PFGE and SCCmec types. A com-
bination of the results of literature and database searches 
indicates that ST9 is associated with pig farming and, al-
though it is found infrequently, this ST has been isolated 
from infected persons worldwide.
Several studies have previously investigated the preva-
lence of MRSA nasal carriage in pigs sampled immediately 
after slaughter (2) or at the farm of origin (13). In our study, 
samples were collected at wet markets, because it not pos-
sible to access pigs at the single slaughterhouse in Hong 
Kong or at the farm sites of origin because >90% of slaugh-
recently been described (11). Six ST9 sequences have been 
submitted to the MLST database (http://www.mlst.net), in-
cluding 5 for MSSA isolates from bloodstream infections 
in the United Kingdom and 1 for a MRSA isolate from the 
nose of a pig in China (ID2357). Single cases of human 
infection with MRSA ST9 t899 have been reported in the 
Netherlands (2) and in Guangzhou, China (12). Eighteen 
spa-type t899 isolates have been submitted to the Ridom 
SpaServer (http://spaserver2.ridom.de): 10 from Germany, 
7 from the Netherlands, and 1 from Belgium. All submis-
sions were recorded as MRSA, but unfortunately, the ori-
gins of the isolates and the MLST types were not reported. 
Although MRSA t899 has been previously associated with 
ST398 isolates from pigs (13) and from participants at a 
conference on pig health (14), the repeat succession of this 
spa type is completely different from those of other ST398-
related spa types and similar to those of spa types related 
to ST9 (Table 2). That the same spa type occurs in both 
ST9 and ST398 is surprising because the MLST allelic se-
quences of these 2 S. aureus lineages are unrelated (Table 
2). However, the occurrence of the same spa types in dis-

DISPATCHES
ter pigs are raised in mainland China and delivered by train 
directly to the slaughterhouse in Hong Kong. Notably, the 
previously reported human infection in China with MRSA-
ST9 occurred in Guangzhou, the province closest to Hong 
Kong, where most of the pigs originate. The colonization 
rate determined in our study represents the level of contam-
ination immediately prior to sale of pig meat to consumers. 
Although pig heads are rarely available in European and 
North American markets, because these parts of the animal 
are generally centrally processed, homemade soup using 
the pig’s nose is commonly consumed in Hong Kong; this 
gastronomic tradition may increase the risk for zoonotic 
transmission of MRSA. Further epidemiologic studies are 
needed to determine the rates of colonization and infection 
with MRSA and MSSA ST9 both in personnel exposed to 
pigs and in the community.

Outbreaks of respiratory infection in institutions in On-
tario, Canada were studied from April 20 to June 12, 2009, 
during the early stages of the emergance of inﬂ uenza A 
pandemic (H1N1) 2009. Despite widespread presence of 
inﬂ uenza in the general population, only 2 of 83 outbreaks 
evaluated by molecular methods were associated with pan-
demic (H1N1) 2009.  
R
espiratory infection outbreaks in institutions housing 
large numbers of residents create an ideal environ-
ment for disease transmission (1). Patients in long-term 
care facilities (LTCFs) for the elderly are more susceptible 
to respiratory infections and have a higher risk for compli-
cations (2,3).
tract illness, 1 of which was laboratory-conﬁ rmed; 3 cases 
of acute respiratory tract illness within 48 hours in a geo-
graphic area (e.g., unit, ﬂ oor); and >2 units having a case of 
acute respiratory illness within a 48-hour period. Inﬂ uenza-
like-illness was deﬁ ned as acute onset of respiratory illness 
with fever and cough with >1 of the following: sore throat, 
arthralgia, myalgia, or prostration.
From April 20 through June 12, 2009, a total of 112 
respiratory infection outbreaks were registered. Molecular 
testing was not used in 29 outbreaks (e.g., insufﬁ cient/in-
appropriate sample). Most of the remaining 83 outbreaks 
submitted for molecular testing originated from LTCFs 
(91%); hospitals (2%), child care centers (2%), and psychi-
atric care facilities (1%) comprised the remainder. Facility 
type was not known for 4% of outbreaks tested. Mean age 
of persons tested as part of an outbreak investigation was 
82 years (SD 13.96 years) and median age was 85 years; 
95% were >57 years of age.
Testing on the 589 specimens received from 161 out-
breaks registered from October 1, 2008 through June 12, 
2009 was performed by real-time reverse transcription–
PCR (RT-PCR) for the inﬂ uenza A virus matrix gene and 
the Luminex Respiratory Viral Panel (RVP) (Luminex Mo-
lecular Diagnostics, Toronto, Ontario, Canada) for other 
respiratory viruses.
An etiologic agent was identiﬁ ed in 89% of the 161 
outbreaks tested by molecular methods. One-hundred-
eleven (69%) were caused by 1 etiologic agent. Two and 
3 different pathogens were identiﬁ ed in 24 (15%) and 6 
(4%) outbreaks, respectively. Four pathogens were identi-
ﬁ ed in 2 (1%) outbreaks. No etiologic agent was identiﬁ ed 
in 18 (11%) of the outbreaks tested by molecular methods, 
which includes 1 specimen in which the result was indeter-
minate for coronavirus OC43. A wide range of causative 
etiologic agents were detected for outbreaks by the RVP 
assay (Table 2). Specimens from most patients were posi-
tive for enterovirus/rhinovirus (114 patients) followed by 
metapneumovirus (85), parainﬂ uenza virus type 3 (55), and 
human inﬂ uenza virus A (H3) (41). No virus was identiﬁ ed 
in 186 patients.

The Study
We reviewed respiratory infection outbreaks regis-
tered with the Public Health Laboratory (PHL), Ontario 
Agency for Health Protection and Promotion dating back to 
October 2007 (Table 1). Molecular detection methods were 
used for a subset of outbreaks registered during October 1, 
2008–April 19, 2009. After emergence of severe respira-
tory illness clusters in Mexico in early April, intensiﬁ ed 
tracking of respiratory infection outbreaks in Ontario was 
undertaken. Consequently, more information was available 
on outbreaks registered during the spring (April 20 to June 
12, 2009); these data comprise the bulk of the study.
Respiratory infection outbreaks in LTCFs were de-
ﬁ ned as any of the following: 2 cases of acute respiratory

ages were 21.5 and 16 years, respectively; only 10% were 
>46 years of age.
Co-infections were noted in 22 of the patients tested by 
the RVP assay. In 1 LTCF outbreak, 2 patients had co-in-
fection of an untypeable inﬂ uenza A and enterovirus/rhino-
virus on testing by RVP. An inﬂ uenza A real-time RT-PCR 
result was negative in both patients; 1 patient had a co-in-
fection with respiratory syncytial virus B and enterovirus/
rhinovirus. Co-infections with coronavirus subtypes 229E 
and NL63 were the most common, observed in 10 of the 22 
patients (45%) infected with multiple pathogens. Isolates 
from 1 patient were positive for 3 viruses (coronavirus sub-
types 229E and NL63 and enterovirus/rhinovirus).
One of the 2 outbreaks identiﬁ ed as caused by pandem-
ic (H1N1) 2009 originated from a LTCF was not observed 
until June 3, 2009, six weeks into the evolving pandemic, 
despite widespread community prevalence. The second 
pandemic (H1N1) 2009 outbreak, registered on June 11, 
2009, originated from a hospital treating patients with inﬂ u-
enza-like illness. Seasonal inﬂ uenza (H1N1 and H3N2) or 
pandemic (H1N1 2009) was detected in 2,966 (25.5%), and 
pandemic (H1N1) 2009 in 2,203 (19%) of 11,612 persons 
tested at PHL for inﬂ uenza A by real-time RT-PCR dur-
ing April 20–June 12, 2009. Seasonal inﬂ uenza A (H3N2) 
was only identiﬁ ed in 273 specimens (11.0%) of the 2,476 
inﬂ uenza A positive samples subtyped. However, it was the 
strain responsible for 15 (88%) of the typeable inﬂ uenza A 
outbreaks at the same time. Seasonal inﬂ uenza A (H1N1) 
was absent from institutional outbreaks and only detected 
in 41 (2%) of subtyped inﬂ uenza A–positive samples from 
the general population.
Persons with laboratory-conﬁ rmed pandemic (H1N1) 
2009 infection tested at the PHL, Ontario Agency for 
Health Protection and Promotion, were younger than those 
tested as part of outbreak investigations. Mean and median 
Conclusions
The number of respiratory infection outbreaks in insti-
tutions submitted to PHL may reﬂ ect disease impact caused 
by respiratory viruses during the inﬂ uenza season. Respi-
ratory viruses during the 2007–08 season may have been 
more active than those of the 2008–09 season because the 
number of outbreaks registered with PHL decreased from 
1 year to the next. Declaration of pandemic status for the 
novel (H1N1) virus has not inﬂ uenced the reporting of re-
spiratory infection outbreaks from institutions in Ontario 
because submission rates for the corresponding period in 
2007–08 and 2008–09 are similar. Variation would not be 
expected because reporting is required by Ontario law (4). 
Respiratory viruses detected in outbreaks in institu-
tions reﬂ ect those known to be major causes of acute respi-
ratory disease in the community; prevalence varies based 
on geographic location, season, and detection methods 
(5–7). Free access to such institutions by members of the 
community (staff or visitors), in conjunction with commu-
nal close quarters of residents, creates an ideal environment 
for propagation of viral respiratory outbreaks (8).
Current guidelines for isolation during viral respiratory 
outbreaks are not tailored for the speciﬁ c virus. As shown 
in this study, multiplex molecular testing makes it possible 
to identify the virus causing most LTCF respiratory infec-
tion outbreaks. Infection control guidelines for a speciﬁ c 
outbreak could be modiﬁ ed based on the incubation period 
and duration of viral shedding for the identiﬁ ed virus (9).
The most commonly identiﬁ ed virus in our study was 
enterovirus/rhinovirus. Clinicians should be reminded that 
2002

Respiratory Infection and Pandemic (H1N1) 2009
rhinovirus can cause severe lower respiratory tract infec-
tion, including death, as documented in several LTCF out-
breaks (10,11). These data highlight the need for molecular 
capacity to diagnose rhinovirus infection because detection 
is otherwise limited to less sensitive viral culture systems.
This review of outbreaks predominantly involving 
elderly persons in LTCFs highlights the sparing of older 
persons by pandemic (H1N1) 2009. Possible explanations 
include cross-protective antibodies from previous expo-
sure to inﬂ uenza A (H1N1) strains circulating before the 
antigenic shift of inﬂ uenza A to subtype H2N2 in 1957 or 
minimal contact with those most likely to have imported 
the pandemic strain into Canada (young travelers) (12). In 
addition, older persons may have less contact with the age 
group (children 10–19 years of age), with most cases being 
in Ontario. Our ﬁ ndings support Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention guidelines for vaccination with monovalent 
pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus vaccine. These guidelines 
have not placed older persons in a high priority group for 
vaccination because increased rates of hospitalization and 
severe disease caused by pandemic (H1N1) 2009 have not 
been observed (13,14). Investment in multiplex technolo-
gies to investigate respiratory outbreaks in LTCFs shortens 
time for pathogen detection, helps guide infection control 
and vaccination policies, and can potentially save resources 
spent on other investigations.

Estimates of 
the Prevalence 
of Pandemic 
(H1N1) 2009, 
United States,
April–July 2009
(H1N1) 2009, we built a probabilistic multiplier model that 
adjusts the count of laboratory-conﬁ rmed cases for each 
of the following steps: medical care seeking (A), speci-
men collection (B), submission of specimens for conﬁ rma-
tion (C), laboratory detection of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 
(D), and reporting of conﬁ rmed cases (E) (Figure). This 
approach has been used to calculate the underrecognized 
impact of foodborne illness in the United States (3).
At each step, we identiﬁ ed a range of proportions ob-
served in prior published studies and recent surveys and 
investigations of pandemic (H1N1) 2009. These include 
2 unpublished community surveys on inﬂ uenza-like ill-
ness (ILI) and health-seeking behavior, the 2007 Behav-
ioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey conducted in 10

Through July 2009, a total of 43,677 laboratory-con-
ﬁ rmed cases of inﬂ uenza A pandemic (H1N1) 2009 were 
reported in the United States, which is likely a substantial 
underestimate of the true number. Correcting for under-as-
certainment using a multiplier model, we estimate that 1.8 
million–5.7 million cases occurred, including 9,000–21,000 
hospitalizations.
H
uman cases of inﬂ uenza A pandemic (H1N1) 2009 
were ﬁ rst identiﬁ ed in the United States in April 2009 
(1,2). By the end of July, >40,000 laboratory-conﬁ rmed 
infections had been reported, representing only a fraction 
of total cases. Persons with inﬂ uenza may not be included 
in reported counts for a variety of reasons, including the 
following: not all ill persons seek medical care and have a 
specimen collected, not all specimens are sent to a public 
health laboratory for conﬁ rmatory testing with reverse tran-
scription–PCR (RT-PCR; rapid point-of-care testing cannot 
differentiate pandemic [H1N1] 2009 from other strains), 
and not all specimens will give positive results because of 
the timing of collection or the quality of the specimen. To 
better estimate the prevalence of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 
during April–July 2009 in the United States, we created a 
simple multiplier model that adjusts for these sources of 
under-ascertainment.
The Study
Through July 23, 2009, a total of 43,677 laboratory-
conﬁ rmed infections with pandemic (H1N1) 2009 had been 
reported in the United States by the 50 states and the Dis-
trict of Columbia, including 5,009 hospitalizations and 302 
deaths. To estimate the total number of cases of pandemic

Prevalence of Pandemic (H1N1) 2009, United States
To further divide estimated cases into age groups, we 
applied the age distribution of conﬁ rmed cases and hospi-
talizations as reported to the US Centers for Disease Con-
trol and Prevention through July 23, 2009 (online Tech-
nical Appendix), and calculated overall and age-speciﬁ c 
incidence of illness and hospitalization, based on the US 
Census monthly population estimates for May 2009. We 
did not have age-speciﬁ c parameter estimates, and thus did 
not stratify by age group within the model. This approach 
may not fully capture differences in the probability of as-
certainment by age.
Using this approach, between April and July 2009, 
we estimate that the median multiplier of reported to es-
timated cases was 79; that is, every reported case of pan-
demic (H1N1) 2009 may represent 79 total cases, with a 
90% probability range of 47–148, for a median estimate of 
3.0 million (range 1.8–5.7 million) symptomatic cases of 
pandemic (H1N1) 2009 in the United States. Likewise, we 
estimate that every hospitalized case of pandemic (H1N1) 
2009 that was reported may represent a median of 2.7 total 
hospitalized persons (90% range 1.9–4.3). This represents 
a median estimate of 14,000 (range 9,000–21,000) hospi-
talizations (Table 2) and thus an estimated ratio of hos-
pitalizations to total symptomatic cases of 0.45% (range 
0.16%–1.2%).
We also estimate that incidence of pandemic (H1N1) 
2009 over the ﬁ rst 4 months of the pandemic in the United 
States ranged from a median of 107/100,000 in persons >65 
years of age, to 2,196/100,000 in persons 5–24 years of age 
(Table 2). The incidence of hospitalization was estimated 
to be highest in young children <5 years of age (median 
13.0/100,000, 90% range 8.8–20.2).
states and repeated in the same states during May 2009, 
and ﬁ eld investigations conducted during early outbreaks 
of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 in Chicago and Delaware (on-
line Technical Appendix, available from www.cdc.gov/
EID/content/15/12/2004-Techapp.pdf; [4]). We theorized 
that, given recommendations for testing, patients hospital-
ized with pandemic (H1N1) 2009 would more likely have 
been tested and their cases reported than would outpatients. 
We therefore stratiﬁ ed our model between hospitalized and 
nonhospitalized cases (Figure). For hospitalized patients, 
we used larger estimates of the proportion of specimens 
collected, tested, and reported, which resulted in smaller 
multiplier values (Table 1). We also adjusted for the fact 
that early in the epidemic physicians and health depart-
ments were encouraged to collect clinical specimens from 
all suspect case-patients with ILI and forward them for con-
ﬁ rmatory testing with RT-PCR. By May 12, due to the in-
creasing number of cases and the demands on public health 
laboratories, guidance for conﬁ rmatory testing was revised 
to focus on hospitalized patients. We therefore used a lower 
estimate for the proportion of specimens collected from pa-
tients with mild illness after that date, effectively increas-
ing the multiplier for those patients (Table 1).
Multipliers were calculated as the simple inverses of 
the proportions at each step. We accounted for variability 
and uncertainty in model parameters by using a probabi-
listic (Monte Carlo) approach (built by using SAS version 
9.2; SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). For each parameter in-
cluded in the model, we used uniform probability distribu-
tions that covered a range of minimum to maximum values, 
from which the model randomly sampled 10,000 iterations 
(online Technical Appendix). We generated median, upper, 
and lower 90% values for the number of total illnesses and 
hospitalizations.

sore throat. Persons with milder illness may be less likely 
to seek care or be tested, and thus may not be fully captured 
in these estimates. Likewise, in some heavily affected ar-
eas, the size of the outbreak quickly exceeded the capacity 
to ascertain and test case-patients. Thus, our results may 
reﬂ ect a conservative estimate of total cases.
As pandemic (H1N1) 2009 continues to spread through 
the United States and the world, laboratory-conﬁ rmed cases 
will continue to greatly underestimate the number of actual 
cases that occur. Surveillance for inﬂ uenza does not tradi-
tionally rely on complete case ascertainment, which would 
be impractical, but on focused case ascertainment with 
well-characterized surveillance systems and special stud-
ies. Unfortunately, relying on laboratory-conﬁ rmed cases 
limits the ability to understand the full impact and sever-
ity of the epidemic, especially when severe cases are more 
likely to be recognized (5).
This model provides a relatively quick and simple 
approach to estimate the human health impact of the epi-
demic in advance of more rigorous analysis of surveillance 
and health care data that will be available over the next 
few years. Health systems and infrastructure may be un-
prepared in the short-term if plans are based on a number 
of conﬁ rmed cases that substantially underestimates the 
impact of the epidemic. We estimate that the total num-
ber of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 cases in the United States 
during April–July 2009 may have been up to 140× greater 
than the reported number of laboratory conﬁ rmed cases. A 
spreadsheet version of the model has been developed and 
is available online (www.cdc.gov/h1n1ﬂ u/tools).  Using 
this tool, health ofﬁ cials and policy makers could adjust 
Conclusions
We demonstrate that the reported cases of laboratory 
conﬁ rmed pandemic (H1N1) 2009 are likely a substantial 
underestimation of the total number of actual illnesses that 
occurred in the community during the spring of 2009. We 
estimate that through July 23, 2009, from 1.8 million to 
5.7 million symptomatic cases of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 
occurred in the United States, resulting in 9,000–21,000 
hospitalizations. We did not estimate the number of deaths 
directly from our model, but among reports of laboratory-
conﬁ rmed cases though July 23, the ratio of deaths to hos-
pitalizations was 6%. When applying this fraction to the 
number of hospitalizations calculated from the model—that 
is, by assuming that deaths and hospitalizations are under-
reported to the same extent—we obtain a median estimate 
of 800 deaths (90% range 550–1,300) during this same 
period. Because this assumption has several limitations 
(5), more sophisticated models are also being developed 
to better understand the severity of the US epidemic in the 
spring of 2009, including intensive care unit admissions 
and deaths (6). 
Our analysis involves several assumptions. Data for 
parameter estimates were collected in limited periods and 
areas and thus may not be fully representative of the entire 
United States. To account for some of this uncertainty, a 
range of values was included for each proportion. Addi-
tional data from surveys of health-seeking behavior, physi-
cian testing practices, and policies for conﬁ rmatory testing 
at public health laboratories could help reﬁ ne the param-
eter estimates. In addition, parameters were obtained from 
studies of persons with ILI, deﬁ ned as fever with cough or

A serosurvey involving 2,520 small mammals from 
Tanzania identiﬁ ed a hot spot of arenavirus circulation in 
Morogoro. Molecular screening detected a new arenavirus 
in Natal multimammate mice (Mastomys natalensis), Mo-
rogoro virus, related to Mopeia virus. Only a small percent-
age of mice carry Morogoro virus, although a large propor-
tion shows speciﬁ c antibodies.

renaviruses are segmented negative-strand RNA vi-
ruses. Their natural hosts are various rodent species. 
The virus family comprises several human pathogens caus-
ing hemorrhagic fever, namely Machupo, Guanarito, Junin, 
Sabia, and Chapare viruses in South America, and Lassa 
and Lujo viruses in Africa (1–3). In addition, Africa har-
bors arenaviruses that are not linked with human disease: 
Mobala, Ippy, Mopeia, and Kodoko viruses (4–7). We con-
ducted a systematic search in wildlife in Tanzania to iden-
tify new African arenaviruses.
The Study
During 1985 through 1989, a total of 2,520 small mam-
mals were live-trapped in different regions of Tanzania. 
After species determination, they were measured and bled

by orbital puncture. Serum samples were tested by indirect 
immunoﬂ uorescent antibody (IFA) assay (8). Lassa virus 
was used as antigen due to its cross-reactivity with immune 
sera from animals infected with other arenaviruses (4,6). 
Clusters of seropositivity were found in Arvicanthis spp. 
rodents from the Iringa region (20%) and in Natal multi-
mammate mice (Mastomys natalensis) from Arusha (18%) 
and Morogoro (17%) (Table 1), which suggests that these 
animals are reservoirs of arenaviruses. Titers ranged from 
16 to 512 and 16 to 4,096 in Arvicanthis spp. rodents and 
M. natalensis mice, respectively. Peak prevalence in M. 
natalensis mice was found on the campus of the Sokoine 
University in Morogoro (23.7% of 746 animals collected 
over several seasons).
In 2004, M. natalensis mice were trapped in a mosaic of 
maize ﬁ elds and fallow grassland at the university campus 
in  the city of Morogoro (6°50′34.9794′′S; 37°38′8.232′′E) 
to identify the virus. The animal voucher specimens were 
deposited at the Royal Museum of Central Africa, Ter-
vuren, Belgium. RNA was prepared from 10 μL of rodent 
serum by using the QIAamp Viral RNA kit (QIAGEN, 
Valencia, CA, USA), and screening was performed by us-
ing a pan–Old World arenavirus reverse transcription–PCR 
(RT-PCR) speciﬁ c for the large (L) gene (9). One of 96 
serum samples was positive (no. 3017/2004) (Table 2), and 
sequencing of the PCR fragment showed a new arenavirus 
sequence. The virus was isolated in Vero cells and called 
Morogoro virus (strain 3017/2004).
For sequencing, the isolate was propagated in T75 
ﬂ asks, virus particles in supernatant were pelleted by ultra-
centrifugation, and RNA was isolated by using the QIAamp 
Viral RNA kit (QIAGEN). The entire 3.5-kb small (S) RNA 
segment was ampliﬁ ed by RT-PCR as described previously 
(10). The 7-kb L RNA segment was ampliﬁ ed in 2 fragments 
by using a long-range RT-PCR protocol and primers target-
ing the conserved termini of L RNA and Morogoro virus–
speciﬁ c primers designed on the basis of the sequence of the 
fragment detected by RT-PCR screening. By using the PCR 
products as a template, short overlapping fragments were 
ampliﬁ ed and sequenced with a set of consensus primers 
for Old World arenaviruses, and S and L RNA sequences 
were assembled (GenBank accession nos. EU914103 and 
EU914104). (Sequences reported in this article have been 
submitted to GenBank and assigned the following accession 
numbers: full-length S and L RNA sequences of Morogoro 
virus, EU914103–04; partial L gene sequences of Morogoro 
virus, EU914107–22; cytochrome B gene of Morogoro vi-
rus-positive Mastomys natalensis, EU914105–06.)
Full-length amino acid sequences of glycoprotein 
precursor (GPC), nucleoprotein (NP), and L protein of 
Morogoro virus were aligned with published Old World 
arenavirus sequences and pairwise p distances were calcu-
lated. Morogoro virus showed genetic similarity to strains

*Positive samples as well as the respective sampling sites and animals are indicated in boldface.
†Immunofluorescent antibody (IFA) assay was performed with Lassa virus–infected cells (cut-off titer 16). 
‡Fifty IFA assay–positive serum samples were randomly selected and tested by immunoblotting. Presence of African arenavirus–specific antibodies, as 
defined by reactivity with Lassa virus nucleoprotein and glycoprotein 2, was confirmed in 47 serum specimens. 
An additional 303 ethanol-preserved liver samples and 
63 serum samples were collected in 2004 and 2007, respec-
tively. Liver tissue (≈3 mg) was homogenized by using a 
bead mill. Cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation, and 
RNA was isolated from the homogenate with the RNeasy 
Mini kit (QIAGEN). Testing by L gene RT-PCR (9) showed 
16 positive liver and serum samples, which indicated a vi-
rus prevalence in the M. natalensis population of ≈4% (Ta-
ble 2). PCR fragments were sequenced (GenBank acces-
sion nos. EU914107–EU914122), and Morogoro virus was 
isolated in cell culture from all 4 PCR-positive serum sam-
ples obtained in 2007. Morogoro virus–speciﬁ c antibodies 
in serum samples from 2004 and 2007 were measured by 
IFA assay using Vero cells infected with Morogoro virus. 
The antibody prevalence was ≈50%, which compares quite 
well with the 23% prevalence determined in this area 20 
years before. In some animals, virus and antibodies were 
detected (Table 2).
The availability of Morogoro virus L gene sequences 
from 2004 and 2007, originating from the same host popu-
lation (trapping sites <1 km apart), provided us with the 
of Mopeia virus that were circulating in Mozambique (4) 
and Zimbabwe (5). A close relationship between both vi-
ruses was also demonstrated by phylogenetic analysis us-
ing GPC, NP, and L gene sequences (Figure 1, panel D, 
and data not shown). Both viruses are sister taxa, sharing a 
common ancestor with Mobala virus.
Although the distances between Morogoro and Mopeia 
virus in the amino acid sequence of GPC (12%), NP (12%–
13%), and L gene (26%) were higher than intraspecies dif-
ferences among known African arenaviruses (i.e., pairwise 
differences between strains of the same species; <11% in 
GPC and NP; <21% in L), they did not reach the level of 
interspecies distances (>20% in GPC and NP; >37% in L) 
(Figure 1, panels A–C). Therefore, we currently consider 
Morogoro virus a subspecies of Mopeia virus rather than 
a new arenavirus species. This classiﬁ cation is supported 
by the fact that both viruses share the same host. Sequenc-
ing of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene of rodent liver 
samples positive for Morogoro virus conﬁ rmed that its 
natural host is M. natalensis mice (GenBank accession nos. 
EU914105 and EU914106).

difference in date between the samples is not large. The 
tree topology did not correlate with geographic or ecologic 
sampling data.
The pathogenicity of Morogoro virus for humans is not 
known, though its phylogenetic clustering with African are-
naviruses that are not linked with human disease (4–6) and 
the absence of hemorrhagic fever in the area suggest that 
it does not cause severe disease. Hospital-based investiga-
tions are required to estimate the public health relevance of 
this virus.

cause early attempts to substantiate the existence of the vi-
rus failed. The identiﬁ cation of the virus was facilitated by 
a recently developed pan–Old World arenavirus PCR (9) 
that also led to the discovery of new arenaviruses in ro-
dents from West Africa (7). Only a small percentage of M. 
natalensis mice carry Morogoro virus, and a large propor-
tion shows speciﬁ c antibodies, which indicates that most 
animals clear the virus during life. Viruses and antibodies, 
which are presumbably directed to nucleocapsid proteins, 
also co-circulate, as seen in hantavirus infection in rodents 
(12). Detection of Morogoro virus in the liver is consistent 
with the organ tropism of Lassa virus in M. natalensis mice 
(13). In agreement with studies on Lassa virus strains, the 
largest genetic distance between Morogoro and Mopeia vi-
rus was seen in L gene, which contains several highly vari-
able regions (14).

missible to at least 7 species (1), resulting in propagation of 
PrPd that retains the characteristic molecular signature of 
the original BSE prion strain (5–7).
Current thinking favors a seeded polymerization mod-
el for the conversion of PrPC into PrPd, which has led to the 
development of several cell-free in vitro conversion model 
systems (8). One such system is protein misfolding cyclic 
ampliﬁ cation (PMCA) (9), in which small amounts of PrPd 
introduced (seeded) into substrate containing excess PrPC 
and other essential conversion cofactors can be ampliﬁ ed 
to readily detectable levels by sequential cycles of sonica-
tion and incubation. We have previously reported that the 
molecular characteristics, electrophoretic mobility, and 
glycoform ratio of the PrPres associated with the vCJD PrPd 
conformer were faithfully reproduced by PMCA (10). How-
ever, the efﬁ ciency of ampliﬁ cation achieved depended on 
the substrate’s prion protein gene codon 129 (PRNP-129) 
genotype. The most efﬁ cient ampliﬁ cation was achieved 
in a methionine homozygous (PRNP-129MM) substrate; 
the least efﬁ cient, in a valine homozygous (PRNP-129VV) 
substrate. To estimate the molecular component of trans-
mission barriers for particular TSE agents between species, 
we used PMCA reactions to amplify PrPd associated with 
vCJD (10), bovine BSE (11), ovine scrapie (12), and exper-
imental ovine BSE (13) and substrates prepared from hu-
manized transgenic mouse brain tissue expressing each of 
the 3 main PRNP polymorphic variants found in Caucasian 
human populations (PRNP-129MM, MV, and VV) (14). 
To assess interspecies barriers to transmission of 
transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), we in-
vestigated the ability of disease-associated prion proteins 
(PrPd) to initiate conversion of the human normal cellular 
form of prion protein of the 3 major PRNP polymorphic 
variants in vitro. Protein misfolding cyclic ampliﬁ cation 
showed that conformation of PrPd partly determines host 
susceptibility. 
T
he agents responsible for the transmissible spongiform 
encephalopathies (TSEs) are called prions. Although 
their precise biochemical composition is a matter of debate, 
they are known to occur in a series of strains, each with 
a characteristic disease phenotype and host range (1). A 
central event in neuropathogenesis of TSEs is conversion 
of the normal cellular form of the prion protein (PrPC) to 
the pathognomonic disease-associated isoform (PrPd) (2). 
In the absence of a known nucleic acid genome, it has been 
proposed that the strain-like properties of different TSE 
agents are encoded by distinct self-propagating conforma-
tional variants (conformers) of PrPd (3). The best developed 
method available for typing these PrPd isoforms uses limited 
proteolysis and classiﬁ cation of the protease-resistant prion 
protein (PrPres) in terms of the sizes of the nonglycosylated 
fragment(s) produced and the ratio of the 3 possible glyco-
forms (3). If distinct conformers and glycotypes of PrPd are 
responsible for diversity of prion strains, then they would 
be expected to be able to impose these molecular charac-
teristics onto PrPC of the same amino acid sequence (when 
transmitted or replicating within a species) and onto PrPC 
of a different primary sequence (when transmitted between 
species). In support of this theory, the agent responsible for 
the TSE of cattle, called bovine spongiform encephalopa-
thy (BSE), the accepted cause of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob 
disease (vCJD) in humans (4), has been shown to be trans-

The Study
We prepared seed and substrate homogenates as 10% 
(wt/vol) homogenates in PMCA conversion buffer (10). 
Seed homogenates were diluted into substrate homoge-
nates so that all PMCA reactions contained equivalent 
amounts of PrPd based on the PrPres levels in each seed ho-
mogenate. PrPres levels were determined by Western blot 
titration that used monoclonal antibody (MAb) 6H4 after 
limited proteinase K digestion. The reaction mixes were 
split into 2 aliquots; 1 aliquot was stored immediately at 
–80°C (−PMCA), and the other was subjected to 48 cycles 
of PMCA (+PMCA) (10). To assess the degree of PrPd am-
pliﬁ cation achieved from each seed in each substrate, the 
samples −/+ PMCA were subjected to limited proteinase K 
digestion, and PrPres was detected by Western blotting with 
MAb 6H4 (which recognizes human, bovine, and ovine 
PrP) and MAb 3F4 (which selectively recognizes only hu-
man PrP and would therefore speciﬁ cally identify PrPres 
formed from human PrPC).
Using MAb 6H4 to probe Western blots, we noted 
ampliﬁ cation of vCJD, bovine BSE, and ovine BSE PrPres 
in the PRNP-129MM substrate (Figure 1, panel A, top) 
but not in the PRNP-129VV substrate (Figure 1, panel A,

in ability to seed ampliﬁ cation in PRNP-129MM substrate 
was a robust phenomenon evident in brain samples from 
3 different ARQ/ARQ sheep with each disease (Figure 2,

plify was not caused by a general lack of competence to 
do so or by inappropriate ampliﬁ cation conditions because 
robust ampliﬁ cation of ovine scrapie PrPres was evident af-
ter PMCA in a substrate prepared from normal ARQ/ARQ 
sheep brain (Figure 2, panel C).
blots by densitometry showed that the degree of ampliﬁ -
cation of vCJD PrPres was considerably greater than that 
of bovine or ovine BSE in the PRNP-129MM substrate

ﬁ cient ampliﬁ cation of vCJD, bovine BSE, and ovine BSE

persons with the PRNP-129MM genotype, as might be pre-
dicted from the efﬁ ciency of ampliﬁ cation of BSE-related 
PrPd shown here. Extrapolating from these results, one 
would predict that the next genotypic group most likely to 
show susceptibility to the BSE agent would be heterozy-
gous (MV) at codon 129 of the PRNP gene, as previously 
suggested from the corresponding in vivo transmission 
studies (14). 
In the wake of BSE epidemics in the United Kingdom 
and elsewhere, enhanced surveillance has identiﬁ ed appar-
ently new TSEs (15), raising concerns regarding animal 
and human health. PMCA with suitable substrate sources 
could provide a rapid way to estimate the molecular com-
ponent of transmission barriers for particular TSE agents 
between species, including humans. These estimates could 
thus indicate whether, like classical scrapie, the agents rep-
PRNP polymorphic status of PrPC and PrPd and the PrPd 
conformers involved (Table). Regardless of the seed PrP 
amino acid sequence, the PrPd conformers associated with 
bovine BSE, ovine BSE, and human vCJD were ampliﬁ ed 
in the humanized mouse substrate and displayed similar 
PRNP-129 genotype preferences (PRNP-129MM >PRNP-
129MV >PRNP-129VV). In contrast, the PrPd conformer 
associated with the ovine scrapie strain, although sharing 
the same PrP amino acid sequence as the PrPd in ovine 
BSE, could not be ampliﬁ ed in any of the PRNP humanized 
mouse substrates but could be ampliﬁ ed in a sheep brain 
substrate. These observations are consistent with confor-
mation of a TSE agent’s PrPd (rather than solely its amino 
acid sequence) having a role in determining the susceptibil-
ity of a host’s PrPC to conversion. They similarly suggest 
that these molecular factors could in turn have a powerful 
inﬂ uence on disease susceptibility and incubation time.

We present the molecular identiﬁ cation of Apodemus 
agrarius (striped ﬁ eld mouse) as reservoir host of the Do-
brava-Belgrade virus (DOBV) lineage DOBV-Aa in 3 fed-
eral states of Germany. Phylogenetic analyses provided 
evidence for multiple spillover of DOBV-Aa to A. ﬂ avicollis, 
a crucial prerequisite for host switch and genetic reassort-
ment.
E
uropean hantaviruses are emerging viruses that can 
cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) 
of differing severities. Dobrava-Belgrade virus (DOBV) 
is a hantavirus that appears in 3 distinct lineages hosted 
by different Apodemus species. The DOBV-Af lineage as-
sociated with the yellow-necked mouse (A. ﬂ avicollis) has 
caused serious HFRS in southeast Europe with a case-fa-
tality rate <12% (1,2). Human infections with Caucasian 
wood mouse (A. ponticus)–associated DOBV-Ap have re-
sulted in more moderate than severe HFRS in the south-
ern part of European Russia (3). Mild-to-moderate human 
DOBV disease in central and eastern Europe has been con-
nected with infection by DOBV-Aa lineage carried by the 
striped ﬁ eld mouse (A. agrarius) (3–5). Other A. agarius–
associated strains, found in Estonia and called Saaremaa 
virus, have been proposed to form a distinct hantavirus 
species (6). In Germany, human DOBV cases with mild 
to moderate clinical outcomes have been detected by sero-

The Study
During 2002 through 2008, a total of 366 Apodemus 
mice were trapped at 7 different sites in Germany (Fig-
ure 1). Serologic screening of transudates collected from 
these rodents by using an in-house DOBV immunoglobu-
lin (Ig) G-ELISA, with a yeast-expressed nucleocapsid 
protein of DOBV-Af as antigen, identiﬁ ed 16 reactive and 
5 equivocal samples of 114 A. agrarius trapped at 7 trap-
ping sites in 3 federal states of Germany (Figure 1; online 
Technical Appendix, available from www.cdc.gov/EID/
content/15/12/2017-Techapp.pdf). Additionally, of 237 A. 
ﬂ avicollis mice, 1 equivocal sample and 4 DOBV-reactive 
samples were detected at 4 trapping sites (Figure 1; online 
Technical Appendix). In contrast, of 15 wood mice (A. 
sylvaticus) originating from 3 trapping sites, none were 
found to be DOBV-seroreactive. A subsequent focus-re-
duction neutralization test showed a higher endpoint titer 
with DOBV-Aa than DOBV-Af (online Technical Appen-
dix) for 6 of the 8 investigated transudates independently, 
whether originating from A. agrarius or A. ﬂ avicollis.
An initial screening by a large (L) segment–speciﬁ c 
nested reverse transcription–PCR (RT-PCR) (3) of 67 lung 
samples, representing all seroreactive (n = 20) and equivo-
cal (n = 6) as well as 36 selected seronegative and 5 sero-
logically not-analyzed animals, showed a 390-nt ampliﬁ ca-
tion product for 21 samples representing 16 seroreactive, 4 
seronegative, and 1 serologically not-investigated animals 
(online Technical Appendix). To enable a comparison with 
the only available DOBV sequence from Germany (H169), 
an S segment portion of 559 nt was ampliﬁ ed by RT-PCR 
from 11 lung tissues (online Technical Appendix). In 
the phylogenetic analyses, all sequences from Germany 
formed 1 well-supported (PUZZLE [www.tree-puzzle.de]) 
and bootstrap support values >90%) monophyletic group 
consisting of 2 clusters. The ﬁ rst cluster contained S seg-
ment sequences from district Güstrow (trapping sites Pe1 
and Pe3), Lüneburg (trapping site WG), Nordvorpommern 
(trapping site H), and the previously published DOBV 
sequence from an HFRS patient from northern Germa-
ny (H169; [8]; Figure 2, panel A). A second cluster was 
formed by S segment sequences originating from districts 
Ostprignitz-Ruppin (trapping sites Ka, To) and Demmin 
(trapping site K/A1). Notably, the A. ﬂ avicollis–derived se-
quences from sites Pe1, H, Ka, and K/A1 clustered together 
or were identical with A. agrarius–derived sequences from 
the same or neighboring trapping sites, suggesting multiple

spillover infections (Figure 2, panel A; online Technical 
Appendix).
The sequences from Germany share a common ances-
tor with the DOBV-Aa sequences originating from Slova-
kia and Russia. Together, they form a monophyletic group 
(DOBV-Aa lineage) that is clearly separated from A. ﬂ av-
icollis–borne (DOBV-Af) and A. ponticus–borne (DOBV-
Ap) sequences and from A. agrarius–borne Saaremaa virus 
sequences. Subsequent analysis of nucleotide sequences of 
the entire nucleocapsid (N) protein– and glycoprotein pre-
cursor (GPC)–encoding regions conﬁ rmed these ﬁ ndings 
(Figure 2, panel B; online Technical Appendix). A pairwise 
comparison between nucleotide and amino acid sequences 
of the complete N and GPC open reading frames from the 
novel German DOBV strains showed divergences of 1.5%–
8.8% (0.3%–1.4%) and 2.1%–8.3% (0.8%–1.8%), respec-
tively (online Technical Appendix Table 2). The highest 
identity values on the nucleotide and amino acid sequence 
level (91.2%–91.7% and 99%–99.7%) were found for an S 
segment sequence from Denmark (Lolland/1403; GenBank 
accession no. AJ616854; online Technical Appendix). The 
nucleotide and amino acid sequence divergence to other 
DOBV sequences was much higher, reaching 10.1%–14.3% 
(1%–3.3%) and 12.6%–20.7% (2.9%–9.4%), respectively.
Morphologic species determination for all DOBV-
seroreactive and RT-PCR–positive rodents was conﬁ rmed 
by a mitochondrial cytochrome b gene-speciﬁ c PCR (9,10), 
sequence determination, and comparison with available 
GenBank sequences from A. agrarius and A. ﬂ avicollis 
(online Technical Appendix).
Conclusions
Based on a large panel of the entire N- and GPC-en-
coding DOBV sequences, we report direct molecular evi-
dence that DOBV in Germany is represented by a genetic 
lineage associated with A. agrarius (DOBV-Aa). In con-
trast, we found no evidence for the occurrence of DOBV-Af 
in A. ﬂ avicollis or other Apodemus species from Germany. 
Consistent with the geographic distribution of A. agrarius 
(11) and the report of human DOBV disease exclusively 
in northern and northeastern Germany, this ﬁ nding may 
conﬁ rm DOBV-Aa as the sole causative agent of DOBV 
infections in Germany (4; Robert Koch-Institut, SurvStat, 
www.rki.de).
Previously A. agrarius–associated Saaremaa virus 
was experimentally shown to be able to infect A. agrari-
us and A. ﬂ avicollis mice (12). We report multiple natu-
ral spillover infections of A. ﬂ avicollis by a DOBV strain 
originally hosted by A. agrarius. The observed spillover 
infections represent a crucial prerequisite for genetic reas-
sortment. This observation is in contrast to other reports 
from Slovenia and Slovakia where, although A. agrarius 
and A. ﬂ avicollis are occurring sympatrically, A. ﬂ avicollis

A. ﬂ avicollis mouse was detected in each location (marked with 
stars). At site Pe1, 1 equivocal sample was found by the DOBV 
immunoglobulin (Ig) G ELISA. In addition to Apodemus mice, 
138 rodents of other species, including 116 bank voles (Myodes 
glareolus), were trapped during the same period at sites Pe1, 
Pe3, K/A1, Ka, and To, but none of the 136 rodents with available 
transudates reacted in the DOBV IgG ELISA. Transudates with an 
optical density (OD) value below the lower cutoff (average of the 
OD values determined for 2 parallel tests of a negative Apodemus 
spp. serum control; average 0.041) were regarded as negative. 
Samples with an OD value above the upper cutoff (2-fold of the 
lower cutoff; average 0.082) were regarded as positive. Samples 
showing OD values between the lower and upper cutoffs were 
regarded as equivocal.

single DOBV-Af spillover infections of A. sylvaticus and 
Mus musculus have been reported previously (14).
The phylogenetic analyses demonstrated 2 well-sepa-
rated clusters within the DOBV-Aa lineage. These rodent-
derived DOBV sequences in Germany represent a major 
contribution to the DOBV genomics and phylogenetics. 
Future investigations should help to identify speciﬁ c fea-
tures of these DOBV-Aa strains resulting in its frequent 
spillover to A. ﬂ avicollis and to prove a putative adapta-
tion of DOBV-Aa on A. ﬂ avicollis after spillover, as well 
as possible reassortment processes.

ing a fatal case of human pneumonic plague in 2007 that 
resulted from direct contact with an infected puma (Puma 
concolor) (8). Despite the known association of felids with 
human plague, the prevalence of Y. pestis infection in non-
domestic cats remains relatively unknown.
Pumas and bobcats (Lynx rufus) are 2 of the most 
widespread felids in North American, with pumas having 
the greatest range of any wild terrestrial mammal in the 
Western Hemisphere (9). Both species inhabit large ter-
ritories and travel great distances during dispersal (9,10). 
These highly mobile animals may periodically reintroduce 
Y. pestis–positive ﬂ eas to distant regions, especially during 
epizootics (11). Consequently, carnivore-aided ﬂ ea disper-
sal could play an important role in the spread and persis-
tence of plague during interepizootic periods.
We examined plague exposure in populations of bob-
cats and pumas in California and Colorado. This gave us an 
opportunity to evaluate Y. pestis seroprevalence in multiple 
difﬁ cult-to-sample, plague-susceptible felid species across 
a wide geographic area.
Plague seroprevalence was estimated in populations 
of pumas and bobcats in the western United States. High 
levels of exposure in plague-endemic regions indicate the 
need to consider the ecology and pathobiology of plague 
in nondomestic felid hosts to better understand the role of 
these species in disease persistence and transmission.
Z
oonotic pathogens account for ≈60% of emerging dis-
eases (1,2). Yersinia pestis, a vector-borne bacterium 
and the causative agent of plague in mammals, is 1 such 
emergent pathogen (3). Plague is maintained among rodent 
hosts and their ﬂ eas; however, spillover into accidental 
hosts can result in severe illness and death, as well as geo-
graphic spread of the disease (4).
Domestic cats are a major source of human plague in-
fections in the United States (5), putting veterinary work-
ers and pet owners at risk for Y. pestis infections. During 
1924–2006, a total of 13 human cases of primary pneu-
monic plague were documented in the United States, and 
>5 were associated with felids (D. Wong, pers. comm.). 
Twelve cases of plague transmission from nondomestic 
carnivores to humans have been documented (5–7), includ-

The Study
We collected samples from 119 pumas and 212 bob-
cats (Table 1) in 3 locations in southern California and 
2 locations in western and north-central Colorado (Fig-
ure) from autumn 2002 through summer 2008. Seventy-
seven of these bobcat samples consisted of thoracic ﬂ uid 
collected postmortem from hunter-killed animals. Eight 
puma samples collected in the 1980s served as historical 
reference for puma samples from the Colorado Western 
Slope (i.e., area west of the Continental Divide). Animals 
were captured, sampled, and released with permission of 
cooperating agencies after approval by animal care and 
use committees. Samples were processed according to 
protocol (12).
Thoracic ﬂ uid samples were immunoblotted onto ni-
trocellulose membranes (immuno-blot polyvinylidene 
ﬂ uoride membranes; Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) and 
probed with goat-anti-cat-phosphatase labeled antibody 
to verify the presence of immunoglobulin. Reacted mem-
branes were rinsed 3 times with phosphate-buffered saline, 
once in Milli-Q (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) and were 
then exposed to a 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate/
nitroblue tetrazolium (alkaline-phosphatase chromogen) 
substrate (Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories, Gaithers-
burg, MD, USA). Samples were classiﬁ ed by comparing 
staining intensity to positive (bobcat/domestic cat serum) 
and negative controls (water and goat serum).
Serum and thoracic ﬂ uid samples were analyzed for Y. 
pestis antibody using a hemagglutination assay according 
to a standard protocol (13). Positive samples were evalu-
ated according to Chu (13). If a limited amount of sample 
was available, serum was diluted 1:4 and considered posi-

luted, and a reading >16 was considered positive (13).
Data were analyzed by using a logistic link function 
and binary error, with antibody presence (positive vs. nega-
tive) as the outcome variable (SAS version 9.1; SAS, Cary, 
NC, USA). Estimates used maximum likelihood. Degrees 
of freedom were calculated by using a Kenward-Roger ad-
justment. Categorical factors included location, species, 
age, sex, and capture season. Animals captured in the fall 
(September–November) and in Ventura County were not 
plague positive and were omitted. All factors were treated 
as ﬁ xed variables, including location, because of previously 
reported differences in regional seroprevalence rates.
A total of 76 of 77 thoracic ﬂ uid samples had immu-
noglobulin present, as assessed by visual comparison of 
immunoblot staining, and were included in Y. pestis anti-
body analysis. Interactions were not signiﬁ cant and were 
omitted. Mean Y. pestis seroprevalence for pumas and 
bobcats across all locations was 17.7% (95% conﬁ dence 
interval [CI] 13.6%–21.8%). However, considerable vari-
ability existed across locations (Front Range, Colorado,

Western Slope, Colorado, mean = 46.03 [95% CI 24.37–

plague exposure; however, animal age, geographic loca-
tion, and capture season were signiﬁ cant (Table 2). Adult 
animals (>2 years of age) and animals from the Colorado 
Western Slope were more likely to be seropositive (Table 
1). Sixty-three percent (5/8) of historical puma samples 
from the Western Slope had detectable plague antibodies, 
similar to the seroprevalence rate of contemporary puma 
samples from this region (46.03%). Season also played a

long-sleeved shirts when handling anesthetized animals 
and using an N95-rated mask when conducting necropsies 
or handling deceased animals. Outside of human infections, 
plague could constitute a problem for felid conservation in 
areas of high plague activity (1,15).
Results suggest large numbers of Y. pestis–exposed 
pumas and bobcats. Regular serosurveys that document 
seroreactivity increases above an original baseline could 
indicate epizootic activity in felids and other plague hosts. 
High regional seroprevalence indicate these animals may 
be involved in the persistence and transmission of Y. pes-
tis. This and the documented transmission of plague from 
nondomestic carnivores to humans (6–8) emphasize the 
need to better understand the role of wild felids in plague 
dynamics.

role, and spring-captured animals were more likely to be 
seropositive (Tables 1 and 2).
Colorado sample sites showed 51 (38%) positive of 
135 animals tested. Seroprevalence rates in the Colorado 
sample areas were 21% (Front Range) and 46% (Western 
Slope) respectively, a higher proportion than expected giv-
en the severe disease seen in plague infections in some do-
mestic cats (3). California sample sites had limited plague 
seroreactivity, with only 4 (2.2%) of 181 animals positive 
for plague exposure.
The Colorado Western Slope is near the Four Corners 
region (i.e., contiguous boundaries of southwestern Colo-
rado, northwestern New Mexico, northeastern Arizona, and 
southeastern Utah). During 1957–2004, a total of 419 hu-
man plague cases were documented in the United States, of 
which 83% were from this region (14). The complex dy-
namics governing high plague incidence in this region are 
not fully understood despite extensive research but most 
likely involve climate, mammalian reservoirs, vector spe-
cies, and habitat ecotypes (4,7,14).

Conclusions
Plague dynamics often are characterized by epizootics, 
resulting in interannual variation in infection rates among 
plague hosts; however, seroprevalence of 8 puma samples 
collected in the 1980s mirrored contemporary samples col-
lected since 2002 and may indicate high levels of sustained 
plague activity in the area in this species. Seroprevalence 
rates were similar across multiple sample years. Vector-
borne disease often is highly seasonal because of annual 
shifts in vector activities and abundance (4); however, sea-
sonal patterns based on serologic data must be interpreted 
with caution because of long-term antibody persistence in 
some recaptured animals (S.N. Bevins, unpub. data).
Puma and bobcat data from this study suggest expo-
sure followed by recovery. All animals were outwardly 
healthy. Deaths caused by plague have been documented 
in wild felids (8,9,15), and the potential for plague expo-
sure remains a concern for ﬁ eld biologists, veterinarians, 
hunters, and skinners. Field biosafety guidelines have been 
developed in conjunction with Colorado State University’s 
Biosafety Ofﬁ ce as a result of these ﬁ ndings. Recommen-
dations include wearing disposable gloves, long pants, and

wild-type strains, these studies did not recover infectious 
virus from live offspring (although many ﬁ eld strains do 
not grow in tissue culture) and suggested that fetal infec-
tion often resulted in deformation, stillbirth, or abortion 
(6,7). Collectively, this information led to the assumption 
that only viruses passaged in tissue culture had the potential 
to overwinter by transplacental transmission (8). However, 
in 2008, nonlethal transplacental transmission of BTV-8 
was detected in Northern Ireland (9). To examine the oc-
currence, rate, and consequences of transplacental BTV-8 
transmission in the United Kingdom, we studied calves 
born to dams naturally infected with BTV-8 during preg-
nancy.

To determine whether transplacental transmission 
could explain overwintering of bluetongue virus in the United 
Kingdom, we studied calves born to dams naturally infected 
during pregnancy in 2007–08. Approximately 33% were in-
fected transplacentally; some had compromised health. In 
all infected calves, viral load decreased after birth; no evi-
dence of persistent infection was found.
B
luetongue virus (BTV) is generally transmitted be-
tween ruminant hosts by Culicoides biting midges, 
and infection may result in the disease called bluetongue. 
In 2006, a strain of BTV-8 caused the ﬁ rst outbreak of 
bluetongue in northern Europe (1). Although adult Culi-
coides midges are absent from this region during winter 
for long enough to interrupt normal transmission, BTV-8 
survived the winters of 2006–07 and 2007–08.
Several mechanisms have been suggested to explain 
the overwintering of BTV, one of which is transplacen-
tal transmission (2). Tissue-attenuated strains of BTV are 
sometimes capable of crossing the placenta and infecting 
fetuses in utero (3), and transplacental infection has been 
reported from the ﬁ eld after use of live attenuated vaccines 
(4). However, many wild-type strains of BTV failed to 
cross the placental barrier when cows were infected dur-
ing pregnancy (5). Additionally, although a few studies 
have reported experimental transplacental infection with

The Study
After obtaining owners’ permission, we sampled 
calves born to previously infected dams during the vec-
tor-free period of December 20, 2007 to March 15, 2008. 
Farmers were also asked to report any births, abortions, or 
stillbirths from BTV-infected dams outside the vector-free 
period. Blood samples from live calves were taken as soon 
as possible after birth (usually within 4 days) and tested by 
using a real-time reverse transcription–PCR (rRT-PCR) 
(10) and the Pourquier c-ELISA kit (IDEXX, Chalfont St. 
Peter, UK). When possible, information about the health 
of the calf was obtained, dams were sampled alongside 
their calves, and placenta samples were collected. Calves 
with positive BTV RNA results were resampled at 2–3 
week intervals. In total, 61 calves were tested and 21 (in-
cluding 1 set of twins) had detectable levels of BTV RNA 
in their blood or organs (online Appendix Table, avail-
able from www.cdc.gov/EID/content/15/12/2025-appT.
htm). The transplacental transmission rate was 33% (95% 
conﬁ dence interval 22%–47%).
All calves except calf 21 and calf X, each of which had 
not consumed colostrum before sampling, had antibodies 
against BTV. Calf 21 was also negative for BTV RNA, but 
calf X showed the highest viral load in the blood (online 
Appendix Table). Virus isolation in KC cells (11) was at-
tempted for all calf blood samples with a cycle threshold 
(Ct) <29, but virus was isolated from calf X only. Viral 
RNA load in all calves tested declined over time, and al-
most all calves were rRT-PCR negative by the end of the 
study (Table).
When the calves were ﬁ rst sampled, 52 dams were also 
tested. The RNA load in the calves always exceeded that 
of their dams, and 7 of the 20 dams giving birth to BTV-
positive calves had no detectable viremia.
Of the 21 BTV RNA–positive calves, 5 had compro-
mised health. Calves Y, X, and 33 were born weak and died 
within hours, days, and weeks after birth, respectively, and 
calves 13 and 29 exhibited dummy calf syndrome (12). All 
calves except calf 33 were examined postmortem and had

negative PCRs for bovine viral diarrhea virus (S.W., pers. 
comm.). Although calf X died of colisepticemia, this illness 
probably resulted from the calf’s weakness and inability to 
consume colostrum. No infectious cause for the early post-
natal death of calf Y, other than bluetongue, was identiﬁ ed; 
pathologic ﬁ ndings for calves 13 and 29 are described else-
where (S.W. et al., unpub. data). Calf 27, which had nega-
tive BTV test results, was born with hypermobility of the 
fetlock joints, unilateral carpal valgus, and arthrogryposis. 
All other calves were reported to be healthy.
Time windows for possible in utero infection of each 
calf were calculated according to the BTV testing history of 
the dam and the birth date of the calf (Figure). These win-
dows were used to investigate effect of stage of gestation on 
the probability of transplacental transmission. To account 
for uncertainty in the date of infection, we used Bayes-
ian methods (online Technical Appendix, available from 
www.cdc.gov/EID/content/15/12/2025-Techapp.pdf). The 
probability of transplacental transmission increased with 
the time of gestation during which the dam became infected 
(β1 0.033; 95% credibility interval 0.014–0.063).
in some of these countries, many seropositive dams could 
have been infected before pregnancy, leading to underesti-
mation of the probability of transplacental infection. In our 
study, we tested only calves from dams infected between 
August and December 2007 and known to be pregnant at 
the time of infection. Furthermore, analysis of our data sug-
gests that transplacental transmission is more likely when 
infection occurs later in gestation; indeed, most of the dams 
in this study would have been in the second or third ges-
tation trimester when infected (Figure), which may have 
increased our estimated rate over that found in continental 
Europe.
Transplacental transmission is of particular concern 
for policy makers because it may result in the birth of 
immune-tolerant, persistent carriers, as has happened with 
bovine viral diarrhea virus (14). In our study, all BTV-pos-
itive calves other than X and Y were tested after they had 
received colostrum and, hence, maternal antibodies. The 
presence of BTV antibodies in calf Y suggests that fetal an-
tibody formed in response to in utero infection, yet calf X 
had no detectable antibodies against BTV despite strongly 
positive rRT-PCR results. Calf X was infected late in gesta-
tion (Figure), when it should have been capable of mount-
ing its own antibody response (15). Antibody-negative 
PCR-positive calves have been reported elsewhere (13). 
Follow-up testing is needed to assess whether such calves 
remain persistently infected; however, because calf X died 
a few days after birth, follow-up testing was not possible. 
RNA declined in all retested calves (Table); most were 
PCR-negative by the end of the study, including dummy 
calf 13. Therefore, our results do not suggest that transpla-
Conclusions
This detailed ﬁ eld study, which combines data on BTV 
infection in cows with data on transplacentally acquired 
infection in their offspring, demonstrates that the BTV-8 
strain circulating in northern Europe can cross the bovine 
placenta in a high proportion (33%) of cases and infect 
calves when dams are infected during pregnancy. A simi-
lar study in continental Europe suggested a rate of ≈10% 
(13). However, because the transmission season was longer

cental infection with BTV-8 results in subclinical, persis-
tent carriers. Nonetheless, the ﬁ nding that some calves may 
be born with deformaties after the virus has cleared may 
lead to underestimation of the economic effects of BTV; 
calf 27, which was born with limb deformities to a BTV 
positive dam, could be such a case.
Live virus has been successfully isolated from only 4 
transpacentally infected calves (including calf X described 
in this study), all of which received either no maternal co-
lostrum or only pooled colostrum (9,13). Further work is 
needed to assess whether infectious virus can be isolated 
from healthy transplacentally infected calves that have 
colostrum-derived maternal antibodies, because infectious 
virus needs to be present if transplacental infection is to 
play a major role in overwintering. In conclusion, future 
emerging BTV strains should be considered to have the po-
tential for transplacental transmission until investigations 
show otherwise.

Echinococcus vogeli infection in a hunter from the rain 
forest of French Guiana was conﬁ rmed by imaging and mi-
tochondrial DNA sequence analysis. Serologic examination 
showed typical patterns for both alveolar and cystic echi-
nococcosis. Polycystic echinococcis caused by E. vogeli 
may be an emerging parasitic disease in Central and South 
America.
E
chinococcosis is one of the most lethal helminthic 
zoonoses worldwide. The 4 species of the genus Echi-
nococcus are E. granulosus sensu lato, now including 5 
independent species (1,2), which causes cystic echinococ-
cosis (CE); E. multilocularis, which causes alveolar echi-
nococcosis; E. vogeli, which causes polycystic echinococ-
cosis (PE); and E. oligarthrus, which causes the recently 
described unicystic echinococcosis (3–6). Among these 
species, E. oligarthrus and E. vogeli are neotropical species 
localized exclusively in Central and South America (5,6). 
Only 3 cases of E. oligarthrus infection have been reported 
in the literature (1 from Brazil, 1 from Venezuela, and 1 
from Surinam); 168 E. vogeli cases have been reported in 
12 countries in Central and South America. To date, there 
have been no reports of neotropical echinococcosis in Bo-
livia, Paraguay, Guyana, or French Guiana (5,6). E. granu-
losus occurs sympatrically in South America, whereas E. 
multilocularis does not occur there at all (3,5). As both E. 
vogeli and E. oligarthrus have primarily sylvatic life cycles 
and the diagnosis is usually based on histopathologic ex-
amination of resected lesions, the number of human cases 
might be underestimated because of the small number of

The Study
In April 2006, a 72-year-old man was admitted to a lo-
cal hospital in Cayenne, French Guiana, for abdominal pain 
and a palpable epigastric mass. The patient hunted jaguars 
in the rain forest of French Guiana and owned dogs. He had 
no history of travel outside French Guiana. An exploratory 
laparotomy performed in June 2006 showed a hard, whitish 
liver tumor, deemed unresectable. Histopathologic exami-
nation of a biopsied sample of the tumor showed multilocu-
lar cysts. Albendazole treatment was started immediately 
after surgery. In January 2007, the patient was referred to 
the Department of General, Endocrine, and Digestive Sur-
gery at the Saint-Louis Hospital, Paris, France. Computed 
tomography showed a multilocular hypoattenuating cystic 
mass in the left side of the liver, inﬁ ltrating the left glis-
sonian pedicle up to the hepatic hilum (Figure 1, Panel A). 
Magnetic resonance imaging showed a well-deﬁ ned, thin-
walled, multilocular cystic mass (11 × 10 × 12 cm) involv-
ing segments II, III, and IV of the liver (Figure 1, Panel B) 
and multiple intraperitoneal cysts. The cysts appeared mark-
edly hyperintense on T2-weighted images, hypo-intense on 
T1-weighted images, and showed slight enhancement of 
the septa after gadolinium injection. The patient underwent 
a left hepatectomy and resection of intraperitoneal cysts. 
Analysis of the operative specimen showed multiple large 
and small parasite hooks, with mean lengths of 32.7 μm ± 
1.6 μm and 42.7 μm ± 0.7 μm, respectively (Figure 2).
Two serum samples from the patient (one obtained 
in May 2006, the other in December 2006) were analyzed 
by several immunologic techniques; all indicated infec-
tion with Echinococcus spp. Commercial ELISAs using E. 
granulosus antigens (Bordier Afﬁ nity Products, Lausanne, 
Switzerland, and Biotrin International, Antony, France) 
and the E. multilocularis-speciﬁ c Em2plus-ELISA (Bor-
dier Afﬁ nity Products, Switzerland) were both strongly 
positive. Conﬁ rmative Western blots (LD Bio Products, 
Lyon, France) showed a shadow at 16–18 kDa, which is 
characteristic for E. granulosus infection, on both samples. 
Additional Western blots carried out at Asahikawa Medi-
cal College (Asahikawa, Japan) using recombinant anti-
gens (RecAgB8/1, more speciﬁ c for E. granulosus, and 
RecEm18, more speciﬁ c for E. multilocularis; 7,8) also 
showed strong responses. On the basis of serologic patterns 
obtained with recombinant antigens, with no knowledge of 
the patient’s clinical background, travel history, or images 
of the lesion, E. granulosus infection with many multiple 
cysts, advanced E. multilocularis, or advanced E. vogeli in-
fection was suspected (7,9).

percentage of base pairs in common between species. The 
cox1 sequence was found to be 100% identical to E. vogeli 
species originating from Colombia (GenBank accession 
no. AB208546; 2) and was clearly distinguishable from all 
other Echinococcus species (online Appendix Table).
On the basis of imaging showing numerous multiple 
cysts, serologic examination showing typical patterns for 
both alveolar and cystic echinococcosis, and the life history 
of the patient, the diagnosis of polycystic echinococcosis 
caused by E. vogeli could have been made before surgi-
cal intervention (5,7,9). The immunoblot showing a strong 
antibody response to recombinant AgB suggested a large 
volume of cyst ﬂ uid. Therefore, the immunoblot showing 
strong responses to both recombinant Em18 and AgB may 
be a typical pattern for advanced E. vogeli infection (data 
not shown). Because few studies using serologic analysis 
on human E. vogeli cases have been published, it would be 
useful to study antibody responses using recombinant an-
tigens with large numbers of such patients and to compare 
the results with patterns observed with alveolar and cystic 
echinococcosis (7,9). 
After surgery, identiﬁ cation of parasite hooks was car-
ried out. The hooks showed the characteristic shape of E.

polycystic echinococcosis affecting the left side of the liver. White 
arrows indicate the multicystic liver lesion. 
Molecular identiﬁ cation was carried out with reference 
to the GenBank database by using a highly polymorphic 
DNA target (10). DNA from the liver lesion was extract-
ed by using the High Pure PCR Preparation Kit (Roche, 
Mannheim, Germany). A part of the cox1 mitochondrial 
gene was sequenced by using the E. vogeli–speciﬁ c primer 
set (cox1_F: 5′-TTAATTTTGCCTGGGTTTGG-3′ and 
cox1_R: 5′-ACGACCCATATGATCCCAAA-3′). A se-
quence of 492 bp was obtained with the ABI 310 sequenc-
er (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) and was 
compared with Echinococcus spp. sequences published in 
the GenBank database (online Appendix Table, available 
from www.cdc.gov/EID/content/15/12/2029-appT.htm). 
The sequences were aligned by using BioEdit 7.0.9.0 (11), 
and sequence identity matrix was generated based on the

vogeli and thus differed from E. granulosus (mean lengths 
of large hooks 25.9–35 μm, and small hooks 22.6–27.8 
μm) and E. oligarthrus (30.5–33.4 μm and 25.4–27.3 μm, 
respectively) (12,13). E. granulosus and E. oligarthrus also 
occur in South America. The presence of hooks indicated 
that the parasite lesion was fertile in our patient, as shown 
in ≈50% of cases (5). Based on mitochondrial DNA analy-
sis, the parasite identiﬁ cation was conﬁ rmed as E. vogeli. 
Further molecular studies on the haplotypes of this species 
may give information concerning the genetic diversity and 
circulation of the parasite in South America (14).
Albendazole has been used for medical management 
of alveolar and advanced cystic echinococcosis (3). Several 
instances of its efﬁ cacy on polycystic echinococcosis have 
been reported, but given the primacy of surgical manage-
ment of these infections, albendazole will probably remain 
an additional treatment (5).
Neotropical echinococcosis cases are rare compared 
with alveolar and cystic echinococcosis (5). This rarity is 
probably because of the sylvatic life cycle of these species. 
However, because domestic dogs have been introduced to 
areas where E. vogeli is present in its natural cycle, the po-
tential for transmission of the parasites from dogs to hu-
mans by close contact exists. The at-risk population mainly 
lives in rural areas and has limited access to medical ser-
vices, which strongly suggests that many infected persons 
cannot receive adequate treatment for this underestimated 
disease.
Conclusions
We report an autochthonous case of E. vogeli infec-
tion documented in French Guiana. Further investigations 
are needed to improve the serologic diagnosis of this in-
fection and to deﬁ ne its typical serologic pattern compared 
with echinococcosis. Healthcare providers need to be alert 
to the existence of neotropical echinococcosis and should 
consider the possibility of its emergence in Central and 
South America. Although rare, this disease is still lethal in 
untreated cases.

Recombination in 
Vaccine and

of Porcine

Em2007, a porcine reproductive and respiratory syn-
drome virus (PRRSV) variant with a unique 68 aa deletion 
in Nsp2, was recently isolated in China. Phylogenetic and 
molecular evolutionary analyses indicated that Em2007 is a 
natural recombinant between a vaccine strain of PRRSV and 
circulating virus. We also tested its pathogenicity in piglets.  
P
orcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) 
is now considered one of the most economically impor-
tant diseases in countries with intensive swine industries. 
The causative agent, PRRS virus (PRRSV), is a member 
of the family Arteriviridae (1). The genome of PRRSV is 
≈15 kb and encodes 9 open reading frames (ORFs). Two 
distinct genotypes of PRRSV share only ≈60% nucleotide 
identity and are represented by the North American pro-
totype VR-2332 and the European prototype Lelystad vi-
rus (LV) (2). Sequence differences have also been found 
among isolates of the same genotype, particularly in the 
Nsp2 regions within ORF1a, and ORF5 (3). Mutation and 
genetic recombination play an important role in the evolu-
tion of PRRSV (4–6).
Since May 2006, porcine high fever syndrome, caused 
by highly pathogenic PRRSV and characterized by high fe-
ver and high death rates in pigs of all ages, has emerged in 
China and affected >20 million pigs (7–9). Genomic analy-
sis showed that nearly all of the emerging highly patho-
genic PRRSVs isolated from this outbreak share a unique 
discontinuous deletion of 30 aa in Nsp2 (7–10). However, 
a novel PRRSV variant, with a 68 aa deletion in Nsp2, 
emerged in central China in 2007. We report the unique 
genetic characteristics of this novel variant and its patho-
genicity in piglets.

The Study
At the end of 2007, a smaller cDNA fragment than the 
expected size was observed from a fetal piglet when a diag-
nostic reverse transcription–PCR (RT-PCR) was performed 
to amplify the unique genetic marker of the highly patho-
genic PRRSV, indicating that a novel PRRSV variant was 
found. This strain, designated Em2007, was subsequently 
isolated and the full-length genomic sequence was deter-
mined. The genome of Em2007 was 15,272 bp, including 
the poly(A) tail (GenBank accession no. EU262603), and 
shared 87.6% and 57.9% sequence identity with VR-2332 
and LV, respectively, indicating that Em2007 belongs to 
the North American genotype. The Nsp2 gene of Em2007 
was 2,736 bp and encoded 912 aa, with a unique continu-
ous deletion of 68 aa at positions 499–566, relative to strain 
VR-2332 (online Technical Appendix, available from 
www.cdc.gov/EID/content/15/12/2032-Techapp.pdf). This 
unique deletion is substantially different from previous 
PRRSV isolates with deletions in Nsp2 (3,7–11).
To establish the genetic relationships of Em2007, we 
constructed phylogenetic trees using the neighbor-joining 
method based on the full-length genome. Results showed 
that Em2007 formed a minor branch, which was located 
in the middle of 2 clusters represented by CH-1a (the ﬁ rst 
PRRSV isolated in China in 1996) and JXA1 (the highly 
pathogenic PRRSV isolated in China in 2006), respectively 
(data not shown).
We also compared the sequence identity of individual 
Em2007 ORFs with representative PRRSV isolates and 
found that all ORFs have highest identity (>92%) with CH-
1R (an attenuated vaccine strain used in China), except for 
Nsp2 (80.2%). Because recombinations have been reported 
in PRRSV in previous studies (6), we speculated that Em2007 
is a mosaic. To test our hypothesis, we used 3 approaches to 
detect possible recombination events within Em2007. 
First, SimPlot, which calculates and plots the percent 
identity of a query sequence against a panel of reference 
sequences in sliding windows (12), was performed using 
Em2007 as a query. Based on a set of complete genome 
sequences, including 56 Chinese PRRSVs isolated during 
1996-2008, three representative North American strains 
(VR-2332, MN184B, and P129), and 2 attenuated vac-
cine strains (RespPRRS, CH-1R) (the origin of all strains 
is listed in the Table), the SimPlot graph clearly showed 
that Em2007 was generally closer to CH-1R than to any 
other strain. However, there were 3 narrow zones show-
ing disproportionately low levels of similarity between the 
2 strains compared to other regions (Figure 1, panel A). 
Notably, the 3 narrow zones of Em2007 had high levels 
of similarity with WUH1 (a highly pathogenic PRRSV, 
isolated in Wuhan, China in 2006). These results indicated 
that Em2007 is a possible recombinant and CH-1R and 
WUH1 are 2 putative parental-like strains. Recombination

was further analyzed by Bootscan, a program for the detec-
tion of recombination events, and the Genetic Algorithm 
for Recombination Detection (GARD) (13). Six potential 
recombination breakpoints, with maximal χ2, were found 
(Figure 1, panel B), indicating that 3 recombination events 
have taken place within Em2007. Two recombination frag-
ments (1,457–2,312 and 3,245–4,584) are located in Nsp2; 
the third (8,195–9,168) is located in Nsp9.
Phylogenetic trees of nucleotide sequences of each re-
combination region deﬁ ned by GARD, including ﬂ anking 
regions, were further reconstructed by the neighbor-joining 
method. A large discrepancy (p<0.001, by Shimodaira-
Hasegawa test) between phylogenetic trees inferred for 
each recombination region constitutes powerful evidence 
for recombination (online Technical Appendix). In addi-
tion, a retrospective survey found that the fetal piglet from 
which Em2007 was isolated was from a farm in Wuhan, 
China, and CH-1R was used on this farm to control PRRS, 
indicating the potential for recombination between CH-1R 
and WUH1. This evidence further supported the possibility 
that Em2007 is a natural recombinant between CH-1R and 
WUH1.
To test the virulence of Em2007, 40-day-old PRRSV-
free piglets (9 piglets in each group) were inoculated in-
tramuscularly with 105.0 mean tissue cultures infectious 
doses/2 mL of Em2007, CH-1a, and WUH1, respectively. 
Control piglets were inoculated with Dulbecco minimal 
essential medium. Clinical signs and rectal temperature 
were recorded daily. Two piglets from each group were 
euthanized and necropsied at 7 and 10 days postinocula-
tion, and organs including lung, brain, spleen, kidney, liver, 
intestines, and lymph nodes were collected for viral load 
analyses and histopathologic examinations. The remaining 
5 piglets in each group were observed for 21 days to evalu-
ate death rates.
Results showed that piglets inoculated with CH-1a 
experienced only temporary fever and mild respiratory 
symptoms. Obvious clinical signs, including inappetence, 
lethargy, high and continuous fever, red discolorations in 
the body, and blue ears were observed in piglets inoculated

Conclusions
Em2007, a PRRSV variant with a unique continuous 
deletion of 68 aa in Nsp2, was isolated in China. This vari-
ant is a natural recombinant between an attenuated PRRSV 
vaccine strain CH-1R and a highly pathogenic PRRSV 
strain, WUH1. Animal experiments demonstrated that 
while Em2007 has higher virulence than CH-1a, the paren-
tal strain of CH-1R, it is attenuated relative to WUH1.
Previous studies have shown that genetic recombina-
tion occurs between attenuated vaccine strains of PRRSV 
grown together in culture (14). This study demonstrates for 
the ﬁ rst time that natural recombination can occur between 
vaccine and ﬁ eld strains, suggesting that live vaccines have 
the capacity to shape PRRSV evolution by homologous re-
combination with circulating virus.

with WUH1 (Figure 2, panel A). Furthermore, severe in-
terstitial pneumonia (online Technical Appendix) and non-
suppurative encephalitis cases were also observed 7 and 10 
days postinoculation. Four of 5 piglets died within 21 days 
after inoculation (Figure 2, panel B). Piglets inoculated with 
Em2007 also showed similar clinical signs to those seen 
in the WUH1 group. However, the interstitial pneumonia 
and nonsuppurative encephalitis were mild and no deaths 
occurred throughout the experimental period in Em2007 
group. The results of viremia and viral load also indicated 
that Em2007 was more mild than WUH1, but of substan-
tially higher virulence than CH-1a (data not shown).

mean tissue culture infectious doses/2 mL of Em2007, CH-1a,

and necropsied at 7 and 10 days postinoculation (dpi) for viral 
load analyses and histopathologic examinations. The remaining 5

We collected epidemiologic and molecular data from 
Burkholderia mallei isolates from equines in Punjab, Pak-
istan from 1999 through 2007. We show that recent out-
breaks are genetically distinct from available whole ge-
nome sequences and that these genotypes are persistent 
and ubiquitous in Punjab, probably because of human-
mediated movement of equines.
G
landers is an equine disease that was recognized by 
Hippocrates and Aristotle (1). It is caused by the bac-
terium Burkholderia mallei, an obligate pathogen of horses, 
donkeys, and mules (Equidae), with occasional infections 
in felines, canines, and humans (2,3). Strict regulation of 
equines has reduced the range of this once globally dis-
tributed disease to a few endemic foci in South and Cen-
tral America, the Middle East, and parts of Africa and Asia 
(2,4). This emerging disease has only recently regained 
attention following the listing of B. mallei as a Category 
B agent by the US Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention (2). Although outbreaks are common in regions 
of disease endemicity, much of what is known about the 
ecology and natural population dynamics of B. mallei relies 
on indirect evidence and expert opinion, with little to no 
knowledge concerning its genetic diversity (2,3). We ge-
netically characterized 15 samples of B. mallei from recent 
outbreaks in Pakistan to provide additional knowledge of 
how this disease of antiquity is transmitted throughout en-
demic regions today.

The Study
We obtained clinical samples and background infor-
mation from 15 glanderous equids in Punjab, Pakistan from 
1999 through 2007 (Table; online Appendix Table, avail-
able from www.cdc.gov/EID/content/15/12/2036-appT.
htm). Research on equine subjects was approved by the 
Synopsis Scrutiny Committee and Animal Ethics Commit-
tee, Faculty of Veterinary Science, University of Agricul-
ture, Faisalabad, Pakistan. Samples were plated on brain-
heart infusion (BHI) agar with 4% glycerol and incubated 
for 24–30 hours at 37°C. Individual colonies were inocu-
lated into BHI broth containing 4% glycerol and were in-
cubated with shaking for 36 h at 37°C. An aliquot of broth 
(1.5 mL) was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 15 min. Ge-
nomic DNA was extracted from the resulting pellets using

For genotyping, we screened 23 loci (online Appendix 
Table) from a previously established 32-marker multiple 
locus variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) analy-
sis system designed for B. pseudomallei and B. mallei (7). 
In silico genotyping of the same loci was also performed 
for 10 whole genome sequences (WGS) of B. mallei (8; 
online Appendix Table). VNTR markers have higher mu-
tation rates than other genetic markers, which make them 
inappropriate for determining deep levels of evolutionary 
relatedness. VNTRs, however, are appropriate for 1) dis-
crimination between closely related isolates, 2) determi-
nation of the degree of relatedness among isolates, and 
3) discernment of population structure on a spatial scale 
(7,9,10). This utility is especially important for B. mallei 
because it is a recently emerged clone of B. pseudomal-
lei and has been shown to be genetically monomorphic 
with typing methods such as multilocus sequence typing 
(11). To compare the genetic diversity of our Punjab iso-
lates to that of sequenced strains, we performed a phylo-
genetic analysis on the 23 loci using the neighbor-joining 
algorithm in PAUP* 4.0b (9). To determine the genetic 
relationships among the Punjab population itself, we per-
formed the same analysis using only the Punjab isolates 
and polymorphic loci (n = 15 loci).
Combined analysis of the Punjab isolates and WGS 
showed that the Punjab isolates are phylogenetically dis-
tinct from WGS (Figure 1). This ﬁ nding was also demon-
strated in the values for average pairwise distance (APD), 
where the APD among Punjab isolates is 2× lower than the 
APD calculated for either the entire phylogeny or the WGS 
alone (Figure 1). Therefore, the Punjab isolates represent 
only a small amount of the genetic diversity demonstrat-
ed in this pathogen. Phylogenetic analysis of the Punjab 
isolates alone placed 14 of the 15 samples into 3 distinct 
clades with 1 sample standing alone (Figure 2). Most 
samples (9/15) belong to clade A, whose isolates are both

that the Punjab isolates (black text and PRL-20) 
are genetically distinct from and less diverse than 
available whole genome sequences (WGS, red

as a whole genome sequence; therefore, it was 
used in all 3 situations where an average pairwise 
distance (APD) was calculated. Among 10 WGS, the 
average pairwise distance was 0.607; between 10 
WGS and Punjab isolates, average pairwise distance 
was 0.627; and among 15 Punjab isolates, average 
pairwise distance was 0.312. These results indicate 
that the Punjab isolates are more closely related to 
each other than to the sequenced strains because the 
APD among Punjab isolates is 2× lower than the APD

prior (groups 5 and 6, Table). Furthermore, at the time of 
the PRL3 and PRL4 infections, a co-resident mule with no 
previous travel history (PRL44) was negative for glanders, 
making it unlikely that these horses acquired glanders from 
their farm. This mule was positive for glanders ≈1.5 years 
later, and the isolate obtained from its infection clustered 
phylogenetically with the samples from the polo club and

temporally and geographically diverse, suggesting that this 
lineage is ecologically established in Punjab.
Because of the limited sample size, many of the pat-
terns observed from these data may result from sampling 
bias. However, even a limited amount of genotypic data 
can be useful in formulating hypotheses regarding the dis-
persal of B. mallei. For example, the presence of samples 
from Faisalabad in each clade suggests that this district 
may be a center of diversity in the province (Figure 2) but 
this does not indicate a lesser degree of diversity in other 
districts where fewer samples were collected.
The diversity seen in the district of Faisalabad may re-
sult from either 1) the industrial nature of Faisalabad or 2) 
from high endemism of B. mallei in the region. Currently, 
the district has ≈10,000 horses and mules and >44,000 don-
keys, plus other transient equines (12). Many equines move 
through and work in the city, potentially introducing strains 
from surrounding regions. Because horses and mules can 
be positive but asymptomatic for glanders (13), many hosts 
are available to maintain strains throughout the region. 
Communal stables and water troughs are common through-
out the district and B. mallei has been isolated from these 
water troughs (A. Naureen, unpub. data). Furthermore, B. 
mallei can remain viable in contaminated stables for up to 
6 weeks (14) and in sterile tap water for up to 4 weeks (15), 
which provides an environment for establishment and re-
tention of B. mallei populations in Faisalabad.
Combining phylogenetic with epidemiologic data re-
veals how B. mallei disseminates throughout a region. For 
example, epidemiologic data suggests that 2 horses from a 
farm in the district of Sargodha (PRL3 and PRL4) contract-
ed glanders while at a polo club in the Lahore district. This 
is supported by VNTR data, as these 2 isolates clustered 
phylogenetically with one of the samples obtained from 
an outbreak that occurred at the same polo club 3 months

Analytical Profile Index 20E strips; BioMériux, Marcy l’Etoile, France) 
differed nonsubstantially (data not shown). Therefore, only 3 isolates 
were evaluated by using VNTR. Strains PRL11 and PRL13 were isolated 
from horses that were kept at 2 stables �8 km from each other, but  
the 2 stables had a history of mixing.

From November 2004 to March 2005, two horses from a farm in 
Sargodha (PRL3, PRL4) participated in matches at the Lahore Polo 
Club. Horses were returned to their farm in late spring 2005. In the fall of 
2005, there was a glanders outbreak at the Lahore Polo Club (see 
Group 5 above). In December 2005, the 2 horses on the Sargodha farm 
tested positive for glanders after being housed together during the 
winter. A mule (PRL44) that was also present at the Sargodha farm 
tested negative for glanders at this time. Approximately 2 years later, the 
same mule tested positive for glanders after reports of 6 months’ 
standing nasal discharge. Records indicate the mule was brought to the 
farm at a young age from the city of Multan and never left the farm 
before onset of symptoms. 
*VNTR, variable number tandem repeats.  
†Samples from equines with similar histories were assigned to the same epidemiologic group (e.g., Group 1, Group 2). Subgroups were defined based on 
VNTR data; samples with identical VNTR genotypes were assigned to the same subgroup (e.g., PRL11 and PRL13 in Group 1b).

similar to the cases described above. In contrast, epidemio-
logic group 5 (PRL19 and PRL20) was separated into 2 
distinct clades (Figure 2), indicating that this outbreak was 
caused by multiple strains. Therefore, it should not be as-
sumed that an outbreak of glanders is always caused by a 
single strain.
Sargodha horses. Therefore, we hypothesize that the in-
fected horses either directly transferred the disease to the 
mule or they contaminated a source on the farm which sub-
sequently led to the mule’s infection. Environmental sam-
pling would be required to identify the original infection 
source for the horses and subsequent transmission route to 
the mule. Nevertheless, this case shows a strain that was 
transferred a distance of 168 km, demonstrating that hu-
man-mediated movement of equines can inﬂ uence the dis-
tribution of B. mallei genotypes. This case also suggests 
that a strain can persist for ≈1.5 years.
Other cases in the province demonstrate that infections 
either stem from similar strains or are caused by multiple 
strains. For example, samples that were placed in the same 
epidemiologic group cluster together phylogenetically 
(groups 1, 2, and 4; Table), indicating communal infections 
Conclusions
Our study suggests that numerous lineages of Burk-
holderia mallei are present in Punjab, Pakistan, and that 
these lineages persist across geographic space and time. 
Despite this, these isolates appear to be genetically dis-
tinct from other studied strains. The economics and use 
of equines likely contribute to the persistence of glanders 
in this region because modern methods for control of this 
disease (monitoring and euthanasia) are not viable options.

Therefore, other solutions to curbing the spread of glanders 
need to be identiﬁ ed. We suggest that a focus on ﬁ nding 
methods to improve the sanitary conditions of communal 
water troughs and stables may lead to a practical solution 
for disease reduction and containment. Finally, our study 
demonstrates the utility of VNTRs paired with extensive 
epidemiologic data for analyzing the distribution of B. mal-
lei genotypes throughout endemic regions.

permissive infection (production of infectious progeny) of 
human macrophages with the Utah I strain of AMDV (12).

Reports of a possible relationship between Aleutian 
mink disease parvovirus (AMDV) and human infection 
are rare. However, 2 mink farmers with vascular disease 
and microangiopathy similar to that in mink with Aleutian 
disease were found to have AMDV-speciﬁ c antibodies and 
AMDV DNA. These ﬁ ndings raise the suspicion that AMDV 
may play a role in human disease.
A
utonomous parvoviruses, such as Aleutian mink dis-
ease virus (AMDV), cause a broad spectrum of dis-
eases in animals and man. Acute disease manifests itself 
as a lytic infection of rapidly dividing cells; chronic dis-
ease reﬂ ects a restricted or abortive infection of speciﬁ c 
cell types (1). Aleutian disease (AD) is known to produce 
clinical signs in mink and ferrets only (2,3), although other 
mammals have reportedly been antibody positive.
In adult mink, AD is a persistent, slowly progressive 
AMDV infection in which a dysregulated immune system 
and a postinfectious antibody response cause an immune 
complex–mediated vasculitis (2). Perivascular and glomer-
ular immune complexes (2,4,5) can cause membranoprolif-
erative glomerulonephritis (6) and segmental or circumfer-
ential arteritis (4) with mononuclear inﬁ ltration, ﬁ brinoid 
necrosis and deposits, and increased intimal cellularity. 
Mononuclear cells may surround the vessel, and connec-
tive tissue proliferation and necrosis in the tunica elastica 
media narrow the lumen (7). In mink kits, AD causes an 
acute cytopathic infection of alveolar cells, which leads to 
respiratory distress and death (8). 
Reports of a possible relationship between AMDV and 
human infection are rare (9). Histopathologic features like 
those in AMDV-infected mink have been described for 2 
patients in the early 1960s (10). Exposed laboratory work-
ers have had persistent anti-AMDV antibodies for up to 18 
months; however, injection of their antibody-positive blood

The Study
We examined AMDV antibody from each of the 2 
patients by countercurrent and line electrophoresis (13). 
AMDV DNA was identiﬁ ed by standard and nested PCR. 
DNA was extracted from lymph nodes (patient 1) and from 
peripheral blood and bone marrow (patient 2) before ampli-
ﬁ cation with AMDV-speciﬁ c primers. AMDV DNA was 
identiﬁ ed by 2 different sets of primers in the standard PCR 
(5–600 bp) and with 2 complete different internal primers 
in the nested PCR (200 bp). PCR products were cloned, 
and some clones were sequenced to conﬁ rm the presence 
of AMDV DNA. All PCR reactions were done with ap-
propriate controls.
Patient 1 was a mink farmer who had been exposed 
to AMDV-infected mink for 10 years. When he was 22 
years of age, toe ulceration and claudication developed. 
Arteriography showed bilateral occlusions of several 
lower limb arteries and associated development of a col-
lateral network of vessels. At the age of 25, he underwent 
embolectomy, and the removed tissue showed vessel wall 
inﬂ ammation with a granulomatous appearance but no 
necrotizing lesions or epitheloid or eosinophilic inﬁ ltra-
tion. Over the next 10 years, despite surgical attempts to 
revascularize and treatment with anticoagulant drugs, his 
condition deteriorated: his renal, mesenteric, and axillary 
arteries became stenosed, and his right leg was amputated. 
Antibodies to AMDV were found in his serum at the end 
of these 10 years and at 2 subsequent measurements after 
1 additional year. An abdominal aortic biopsy showed ad-
ventitial lymphoplasmacytic cell inﬁ ltration and minimal 
atherosclerosis (Figure 1). A lymph node biopsy sample 
showed modest reactive changes and T-zone hyperpla-
sia, and AMDV DNA was identiﬁ ed in the sample. At 
35 years of age, the patient had a positive serologic result 
for anti-AMDV antibodies and severe claudication. Sub-
sequent testing 1 and 2 years later showed negative results 
for AMDV antibodies and AMDV genome. The patient 
died in 1999, at 40 years of age, at which time his clinical 
condition resembled that of bilateral pneumonia. No spe-
ciﬁ c infectious agent was identiﬁ ed. Postmortem exami-
nation showed periarterial collagen deposits, adventitial 
focal mononuclear accumulations, neutrophil inﬁ ltration 
in the media, ﬁ brosis-related hyperplasia, lipid deposi-
tion and calciﬁ cations of the intima, and microabscesses 
within intraluminal thrombotic material.

Eight years later, patient 2 was readmitted to the hospi-
tal for diarrhea, vomiting, pyrexia, asthenia, and confusion. 
Cerebrospinal ﬂ uid contained high levels of protein and 
pleocytosis, but no speciﬁ c infectious agent could be iso-
lated from the cerebrospinal ﬂ uid or blood. Magnetic reso-
nance imaging showed an increased meningeal signal over 
both cerebral hemispheres. Subsequent investigations re-
peatedly demonstrated anti-AMDV antibodies and AMDV 
DNA in peripheral blood and bone marrow. Serum was still 
positive for AMDV antibodies 2 years later. Despite treat-
ment with antimicrobial drugs, the patient further deterio-
rated and died in 2004, at age 63, after an additional year 
of hospitalization. At postmortem examination, the kidneys 
were reduced in size with evidence of cortical attenuation. 
Increased mesangial hypercellularity was observed. An ad-
enocarcinoma of the right lung had metastasized to the su-

Patient 2 was also a mink farmer. He had been exposed 
to AMDV since the age of 20. At 54 years of age, 2 years 
after an extensive outbreak of AMDV among his mink, he 
was hospitalized for chronic glomerulonephritis. A renal 
biopsy sample showed endocapillary and mesangial prolif-
erative glomerulonephritis with abundant focal semilunes 
(Figure 2, panel A). Immunoﬂ uorescence showed anti-
immunoglobulin M and anti-C3 antibodies localized to the 
renal capillaries. Electron microscopy showed organized 
ﬁ brillar deposits of stacked microtubules of ≈20 nm (Fig-
ure 2, panel B), consistent with ﬁ brillary glomerulonephri-
tis (14), an idiopathic condition characterized by polyclonal 
immune deposits with restricted gamma isotypes. No se-
roimmunologic information was available for the patient at 
this time. Immunosuppression improved his renal function, 
and he remained stable while receiving continuous immu-
nosuppressive medication.

Conclusions
The clinical history, histopathologic features, and mo-
lecular ﬁ ndings for the 2 mink farmers exposed to AMDV 
were similar to those described for AD in mink. The com-
bination of clinical and laboratory ﬁ ndings is unique for 
these patients compared with previous reports. These 2 
patients had micro- and macroangiopathic lesions and 
prolonged persistence of serum antibodies to AMDV and 
AMDV DNA.
On the basis of its early onset, dissemination, and se-
verity, the slight atherosclerosis found in some histopato-
logic specimens from patient 1 represent a consequence of 
the pre-existing arteritis rather than a primary condition. 
Buerger disease is unlikely on the basis of cytopathologic 
and histopathologic ﬁ ndings, and other vasculitic disorders 
were excluded on the basis of serologic ﬁ ndings. The ar-
teritis was similar to the autoimmune vascular lesions ac-
companying AD in mink with adventitial lymphocytic in-
ﬁ ltration (4). The histopathologic ﬁ ndings for patient 2, in 
whom the autoimmune glomerulonephritis was diagnosed 
8 years before the ﬁ rst measurement of anti-AMDV anti-
bodies, resembled the immune complex–mediated glom-
erulonephritis in mink with AD (6).
For patient 1, anti-AMDV antibodies persisted 4 years 
from his last exposure to mink, exceeding the longest re-
ported duration of positive AMDV response in a human 
in the absence of virus exposure (11). Similarly, patient 2 
had a long-lasting antibody response, although under po-
tentially persisting exposure. The persistence of anti-AM-
DV antibodies in patient 2 may reﬂ ect host-related factors 
in the modulation of immune response to chronic antigen 
stimulation. In mink, host-related factors inﬂ uence their 
susceptibility to AMDV infection and correlate with clini-
cal manifestations from an asymptomatic condition to overt 
disease. One may speculate whether the overrepresentation 
of malignant lymphoma in mink farmers could reﬂ ect a part 
of a disease spectrum paralleling monoclonal plasma cell 
proliferation in mink (15).
That AMDV DNA was found only in the ﬁ rst biopsy 
sample from patient 1 may weaken the hypothesis of vi-
rus replication. However, it may reﬂ ect technical difﬁ cul-
ties with DNA ampliﬁ cation after parafﬁ n embedding of 
the specimen or a possible later clearance of the virus from 
infected tissues. Regardless, we have described our clinico-
pathologic and molecular ﬁ ndings with the goal of raising 
awareness about the possible role of AMDV replication in 
human disease.

then, the natural foci have been established, and human 
cases were continuously diagnosed in the new disease-
endemic region (4).
The presence and transmission of hantavirus depend 
on the distribution and infection of its animal hosts, which 
largely determine the incidence and extent of HFRS; such 
distribution and infection are usually determined by envi-
ronmental elements (5,6). Ecologic studies in China demon-
strated that elevation, precipitation, temperature, vegetation 
type, and soil type inﬂ uenced transmission of HTNV (7,8). 
However, these studies were conducted on a relatively large 
scale, usually at the county or even province level. Envi-
ronmental factors driving variability in HFRS incidence 
at a ﬁ ner scale (e.g., township) remain poorly understood. 
The availability of detailed records of HFRS cases and en-
vironmental information in the newly established disease-
endemic region provides an opportunity to explore possible 
factors underlying the emergence of the rodent-borne dis-
ease. In this study, we aimed to learn the current situation 
of endemic HFRS in Beijing, characterize its spatiotempo-
ral distribution, and identify environmental factors possibly 
contributing to the incidence of the disease.
We used geographic information systems to character-
ize the dynamic change in spatial distribution of hemorrhagic 
fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in Beijing, People’s Re-
public of China. The seasonal variation in its incidence was 
observed by creating an epidemic curve. HFRS was associ-
ated with developed land, orchards, and rice paddies.
H
emorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), a 
rodent-borne disease caused by hantaviruses (family 
Bunyaviridae), is characterized by fever, acute renal dys-
function, and hemorrhage manifestations. Various rodent 
species are natural hosts and serve as sources of infection 
(1). Humans usually acquire hantavirus infection by con-
tact with or inhalation of aerosols or excreta from infected 
rodents (2,3). In the People’s Republic of China, HFRS is 
caused mainly by 2 types of hantaviruses, Hantaan virus 
(HTNV) and Seoul virus (SEOV), each of which has co-
evolved with a distinct rodent host. HTNV is associated 
with Apodemus agrarius, whereas SEOV, which causes a 
less severe form of HFRS, is associated with Rattus nor-
vegicus. Although HFRS infection has long been recog-
nized in many places throughout mainland China, HFRS 
was ﬁ rst reported in metropolitan Beijing in 1997. Since 
The Study
The study area covered metropolitan Beijing (between 
115°20′ and 117°30′ E, and 39°28′ and 41°05′N), including 
220 townships of 18 districts with an area of 16,800 km2. 
The data on reported HFRS cases were obtained from the 
National Notiﬁ able Disease Surveillance System, which in-
cluded information about sex, age, residential address, and 
onset date of symptoms for each case.
A total of 852 HFRS cases were reported in Beijing 
metropolis during 1997–2006. The annual incidence of 
each district was calculated by using the ﬁ fth national 
census data in 2000 and mapped by using a geographic in-
formation system (GIS) technique by digitalizing village, 
street, and boundaries on the 1:100,000 topographic map 
of Beijing in ArcGIS 9.0 software (ESRI Inc., Redlands, 
CA, USA). Each HFRS case was geocoded according to 
residential address, and a layer including information about 
HFRS cases was created and overlayed on the digital map. 
By 2000, the disease had affected all the area of the city. 
However, the incidence in each district varied during the 
10-year study period (Figure 1).
An epidemic curve was created to show the temporal 
distribution of HFRS in Beijing. The annual incidence had 
sharply increased from 1997 to 1999; thereafter it ﬂ uctuated 
around 0.8 ± 0.2/100,000 persons (Figure 2). Within each 
year, the incidence varied markedly; most cases occurred 
in winter and spring, usually peaking in April, although the 
disease was reported in almost every month (Figure 2).

Conclusions
Since the ﬁ rst local infection was reported in 1997, 
HFRS cases have occurred in all 18 districts of Beijing, 
with a fairly stable annual incidence since 1999. The dy-
namic change in spatial distribution conﬁ rmed the focal 
nature of the rodent-borne disease. The seasonality is one 
of the epidemiologic characteristics of HFRS, and further 
indicates that HFRS in the region is caused by SEOV with 
domestic rats, with mainly R. norvegicus as the source of 
infection (10,11) The rat population apparently peaks in 
winter, resulting in a lagged impact on transmission and 
To study factors related to HFRS spread, we com-
pared the incidence with various environmental indicators. 
Data on elevation were collected from a digital elevation 
model. Land cover data were derived from 2005 Landsat 7 
enhanced thematic mapper image by using ENVI 4.0 soft-
ware (Research Systems Inc., Boulder, CO, USA). Land 
use types were classiﬁ ed as follows: built-up land, water 
body, dry land, scrub, orchard, irrigable land, rice paddies, 
and forest. Average elevation and area of different land 
use type of each township were calculated by ArcTools 
and Spatial Analyst module in ArcGIS 9.0 software (ESRI 
Inc.). 
To determine the associations between the number of 
HFRS cases per township during the study period and el-
evation, as well as land use type, we performed standard 
Poisson regression analysis by using STATA 9.1 software 
(StataCorp LP, College Station TX, USA) (9). The percent-
age change in incidence in response to the value change of 
the variable by a given amount and its 95% conﬁ dence in-
terval and corresponding p value were estimated after cor-
rection for overdispersion. The Poisson regression analysis 
indicated that built-up land, orchard, and rice paddies were 
signiﬁ cantly associated with HFRS at p<0.05 (Table). The 
incidence rose with increasing coverage of orchard and rice 
paddies, but dropped with decreasing coverage of built-
up land.

seasonal variation of HFRS. In addition, rats are more ac-
tive in homes in the winter because of cold temperature 
outside; this increases the chance for humans to acquire the 
infection by contact or inhalation of aerosols and secretions 
from infected rodents.
Our ﬁ ndings suggest that residents of townships with 
not too much built-up land but with orchard or rice paddies 
are at highest risk for infection. The land-use variables 
(acting as economic development indicators) are likely 
to be suitable for predicting the presence and distribution 
of HFRS in Beijing, where the disease recently emerged 
and economic development has greatly increased. Suit-
able control measures, such as removing rodents and 
preventing them from entering houses and human food 
storage buildings, should be taken to reduce incidence 
in this new disease-endemic region. However, the emer-
gence and endemicity of HFRS are not determined only 
by the economic development activities, although they 
are important environmental contributors to the transmis-
sion of the disease. Biologic, ecologic, and social factors 
such as population immunity level, abundance and infec-
tion rate of host rodents, and human behavior, also may 
affect transmission of HFRS. Further epidemiologic and 
ecologic studies are required to understand the exact vari-
ables contributing to the emergence and extension of the 
disease during urbanization.

are again unknown. To explore hypotheses for changes in 
incidence related to age, we analyzed electronic laboratory

Wales from 1990 through 2007.

To explore hypotheses for age-related changes in 
the incidence of Campylobacter infections in England and 
Wales during 1990–2007, we analyzed electronic labora-
tory data. Disease incidence reduced among children, and 
the greatest increase in risk was among those >60 years of 
age. Risk factors for campylobacteriosis in the elderly popu-
lation should be identiﬁ ed. 
C
ampylobacter infection remains a major public health 
problem worldwide. The infection is unpleasant, al-
though generally self-limiting, and most patients experi-
ence acute enteritis for 7 to 10 days (1). Approximately one 
tenth of patients with laboratory-conﬁ rmed cases require 
hospital treatment as a result of their illness (2), and a range 
of gastrointestinal, arthritic, and neurologic sequelae add to 
disease effects (3). Although food is likely the main source 
of transmission to humans, most human infections cannot 
be explained by recognized risk factors.
In the late 1970s, when the role of Campylobacter spp. 
in human gastrointestinal disease had been newly appreci-
ated, the number of laboratory-conﬁ rmed infections in Eng-
land and Wales began to rise; 8,956 cases were reported in 
1980 and 33,234 in 1989 (Health Protection Agency, unpub. 
data). This increase was largely artifactual, reﬂ ecting in-
creased scientiﬁ c interest in, and testing for, Campylobacter 
spp. and improvements in media and methods for isolating 
them (4,5). The incidence continued to rise throughout the 
1990s and peaked in 2000 at 58,236 cases. The reasons for 
this increase are unknown; further methodologic improve-
ments or increased surveillance activity in that decade can-
not fully explain it. Incidence rapidly decreased between 
2000 and 2004 (from 57,674 to 44,294 cases; 24% decrease; 
Health Protection Agency, unpub. data), after which inci-
dence increased for 3 consecutive years; provisional total

The Study
Data on all Campylobacter isolates obtained from fecal 
or lower gastrointestinal tract samples, reported in England 
and Wales from 1990 through 2007, were extracted from 
the national laboratory database (LabBase) and stored in a 
Microsoft Access (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA, USA) 
database. Cases were assigned to 10-year age groups and to 
geographic areas on the basis of laboratory location (north-
ern, mid-country, southern). The season was assigned on 
the basis of the earliest available specimen date (spring, 
March–May; summer, June–August; autumn, September–
November; winter, December–February). Data on cases of 
cryptosporidiosis and nontyphoidal salmonellosis for the 
same period were extracted and manipulated as above for 
comparative purposes. Denominator data for England and 
Wales for the same period were obtained from the Ofﬁ ce 
for National Statistics. Data were analyzed in Microsoft Ex-
cel 2003 and Stata version 10 (StataCorp, College Station, 
TX, USA). Estimates of incidence per 100,000 population 
were calculated throughout; relative risks (RR) and 95% 
conﬁ dence intervals (CIs) were calculated as required.
From 1990 through 2007 in England and Wales, 
838,436 cases of Campylobacter infection were report-
ed; patient age was available for 810,632 case-patients 
(96.7%). From 1990 through 1999, incidence increased 
in all age groups (Figure 1), but the increase was propor-
tionate to increasing age (0–9 years of age RR 1.07 [95% 
CI 1.03–1.10]; 10–19 years RR 1.47 [95% CI 1.41–1.55]; 
20–59 years RR 1.78 [95% CI 1.75–1.81]; ≥60 years RR 
2.51 [95% CI 2.41–2.61]). From 2000 through 2004, inci-
dence declined in all age groups. However, although the 
degree of decline was similar for those 0–9 years of age 
(RR 0.77 [95% CI 0.74–0.8]), 10–19 years (RR 0.73 [95% 
CI 0.70–0.76]), and 20–59 years (RR 0.75 [95% CI 0.74–
0.76]), for patients aged ≥60 years, the degree of decline 
was signiﬁ cantly lower (RR 0.88 [95% CI 0.86–0.91]; χ2 
p<0.001). Finally, although the incidence increased only 
moderately among those 10–19 years of age (RR 1.02 
[95% CI 0.98–1.07]) and 20–59 years (RR 1.04 [95% CI 
1.03–1.06]) from 2005 through 2007, greater increases 
were observed for those 0–9 years (RR 1.12 [95% CI 1.08–
1.17]) and those ≥60 years (RR 1.33 [95% CI 1.29–1.36]). 
During the surveillance period, therefore, the incidence 
among patients >60 years of age, compared with the in-
cidence among younger patients, increased markedly (RR 
0.45 [95% CI 0.44–0.47] in 1990 to RR 1.17 [95% CI

to affect the results of this study, however. First, isolation 
methods used in England and Wales favor the growth of C. 
jejuni and C. coli (4,5) over that of other species, including

isolations; 0.47%), from 2000 through 2004 (185/44,349; 
0.42%), and from 2005 through 2007 (135/31,637; 0.42%) 
(Health Protection Agency, unpub. data).
When disease incidence was ranked according to spe-
ciﬁ c population group, children 0–9 years of age had the 
highest ranking in 1990, but by 2007, incidence for this age 
group ranked seventh of 9 age groups. Incidence among 
children <10 years declined most rapidly from 1998 to 
2003. This ﬁ nding led to the hypothesis that the introduc-
tion and increased utilization of NHS Direct (a 24-hour 
telephone, online, and interactive digital TV service, which 
provided health advice and information) at this time had 
a “triage effect” on primary care presentation for this age 
group. The 2 events are correlated in time (initial NHS Di-
rect pilot sites began taking calls in March 1998; by April 
1999, 40% of the population of England had access, and 
by November 2000, the service was available throughout 
England and Wales [6]), NHS Direct has had a demon-
strable negative effect on the use of general practice (7), 
and infants and young children are overrepresented among 
calls to NHS Direct about gastrointestinal conditions (8). 
The second Infectious Intestinal Disease study in England, 
currently under way (9), will provide further information 
upon which to assess this hypothesis, which is not readily 
testable by using laboratory data.
By far the most striking ﬁ nding of this study is the 
emergence of older persons as the population most at risk 
for campylobacteriosis in England and Wales. Although 
the elderly were not the only group at risk in 2007 (because 
of increasing incidence), the overall trend singles them out 
1.15–1.19] in 2007). This effect was observed for campy-
lobacteriosis in both sexes, in 3 geographic areas of Eng-
land and Wales, and in all 4 seasons, but was not observed 
for nontyphoidal salmonellosis or cryptosporidiosis (Fig-
ure 2; online Appendix Table, available from www.cdc.
gov/EID/content/16/1/2046-appT.htm).
We report a striking change in the population at risk 
for campylobacteriosis in England and Wales, which is in-
dependent of gender, geography, or season. The absence 
of a similar change in the age distribution of laboratory-
reported salmonellosis or cryptosporidiosis from the same 
population suggests that this is unlikely to be a surveillance 
artifact.
Campylobacter infections are rarely typed beyond the 
genus level in England and Wales, so infections are routine-
ly reported as Campylobacter species. Therefore, changes 
in the incidence of the various species that constitute this 
broad case deﬁ nition could possibly explain some of the 
altered disease pattern reported. For example, infections 
caused by certain species (e.g., C. fetus) are more often as-
sociated with coexisting conditions that might occur more 
frequently in the elderly. This circumstance was unlikely

as the main emerging at-risk group (the increase in other 
age groups requires continued monitoring, however). The 
pattern of infection in older patients is perhaps predict-
able, given the similar pattern for incidence of listeriosis 
in England and Wales since 2001 (10). As life expectancy 
increases in the United Kingdom, the number of persons 
living with chronic conditions is likely to increase; these 
factors suggest that the incidence of campylobacteriosis in 
older persons will continue to increase in the future. There-
fore, risk factors for Campylobacter infection speciﬁ c to 
older UK residents must be identiﬁ ed.

The Study
Thirteen F. tularensis isolates collected over the past 
10 years in Switzerland (Figure 1) were subjected to ex-
tensive genetic characterization. The species and subspe-
cies designations of all strains were conﬁ rmed by real-time 
PCR that targeted the fopA gene and by ampliﬁ cation of the 
RD1 region (8), which showed that all strains were F. tula-
rensis subsp. holarctica. A reference panel of 12 F. tular-
ensis subsp. holarctica strains (7) and the genome sequence 
of the strain isolated in France, FTNF002 (GenBank acces-
sion no. NC_009749), were included in the study to rep-
resent the currently known genetic subpopulations within 
the subspecies. All strains from Switzerland were geneti-
cally characterized at 6 highly variable loci (by MLVA) 
and 14 more stable loci that indicate the classiﬁ cation F. 
tularensis subsp. holarctica strains into genetic subpopula-
tions (by Ftind analysis) (3,6,7). The RD analysis was also 
performed because a 1.59-kb deletion marker, RD23, was 
reported to be restricted to strains from France and Spain 
(3). The MLVA markers (M3, M6, M20, M21, M22, and 
M24) and Ftind markers (Ftind 25–38) were ampliﬁ ed by 
PCR and then sequenced with an ABI Prism 3100 genet-
ic analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) 
and the BigDye Terminator cycle sequencing kit (Applied 
Biosystems). DNA fragment sizes were calculated from 
the nucleotide sequences of the MLVA and Ftind markers 
and used to compare the isolates with previously analyzed 
strains from the United States, Japan, France, and Russia 
(3,7). The RD23 marker was assayed by using standard 
PCR and agarose gel methods as previously described (3). 
A cluster analysis based on the MLVA and indel size data 
was performed by using BioNumerics version 3.5 (Applied 
Maths, Kortrjik, Belgium).

We conducted a molecular analysis of Francisella tular-
ensis strains isolated in Switzerland and identiﬁ ed a speciﬁ c 
subpopulation belonging to a cluster of F. tularensis subsp. 
holarctica that is widely dispersed in central and western 
continental Europe. This subpopulation was present before 
the tularemia epidemics on the Iberian Peninsula.
T
ularemia is a classical zoonosis caused by the faculta-
tive intracellular bacterium Francisella tularensis; it 
is transmissible to humans at infectious doses as low as 
10–50 bacteria when inhaled in aerosols or by inoculation 
of the skin. Traditionally, tularemia is thought of as a dis-
ease contracted by persons performing outdoor activities 
such as hunting or farming, but it can also be acquired 
from pets, for example, hamsters or prairie dogs, which 
are occasionally traded internationally (1). During the 
past 15 years, the reemergence of tularemia has been re-
ported in several European countries (2–4). Spain is a no-
table example, reporting 916 human infections from 1997 
through 2007 in the Castilla and León regions alone (5). 
However, tularemia is rarely diagnosed in central Europe. 
In Switzerland, F. tularensis infection was ﬁ rst described 
in the 1950s, but the pathogen was not isolated until 1996, 
when F. tularensis infection began to reappear sporadi-
cally. To better understand the genetic diversity of Swiss 
F. tularensis strains and their relationship to strains from 
other geographic areas, we analyzed strains from Switzer-
land by using several methods that had been previously 
demonstrated to resolve genetic differences between F. 
tularensis subsp. holarctica strains: multilocus tandem 
repeat analysis (MLVA), canonical F. tularensis insertion 
deletion element (Ftind) analysis, and region of difference 
(RD) 23 analysis (3,6,7).

Europe. Moreover, all the Swiss strains were susceptible 
to erythromycin (MICs 0.25 μg/mL to 1 μg/mL), which is 
a phenotypic marker that has previously been suggested to 
divide F. tularensis subsp. holarctica strains into 2 taxo-
nomic groups (10–12).
As expected, the indel markers served to place each 
strain into major branches of the cluster tree, and the more 
variable MLVA markers provided the ﬁ ne resolution at the 
tips of the tree. The Switzerland strains belonged to the 
same genetic cluster as the F. tularensis strain FTNF002 
from France (Figure 1) that in a previous work clustered 
with strains from Spain (3,9). Moreover, all the Swiss 
strains exhibited the 1.59-kb genomic deletion at the RD23 
locus and the unique 464-bp size at MLVA marker M24, 
which conﬁ rmed their close relationship to the French 
strain FTNF002 as well as to other strains from France and 
Spain (3).
The ﬁ nding of F. tularensis strains in Switzerland rep-
resent sporadic occurrences of tularemia without any obvi-
ous epidemiologic connection. The strains originated from 
6 hares, 3 monkeys, and 4 persons and were collected at 
different locations in Switzerland over a period of 10 years 
(Figure 2). The human infections most likely occurred 
through direct contact with wild animals, through rodent 
bites, and through consumption of a hare cooked at low 
temperature. Those isolates could be resolved into 7 dif-
ferent genotypes (Figure 2). Four Swiss strains displayed a 
genetic proﬁ le identical to that of the representative French 
strain FTNF002 (3). The other 6 genotypes were closely 
related to FTNF002, and all corresponded to the subclade 
B.Br:FTNF002–00 as deﬁ ned by canonical single nucle-
otide polymorphisms  by Vogler et al. (9). This cluster, 
which also contained the strains from the Iberian Penin-
sula, seems to have spread throughout central and western 
Conclusions
Strains of F. tularensis from Switzerland (central Eu-
rope) genetically clustered with strains from France and 
Spain (western Europe) as determined by the unique 464-
bp genetic marker M24 and a speciﬁ c deletion at marker 
RD23. Furthermore, strains within the cluster differed at 
only 2 MLVA markers,and 4 other MLVA and 14 Ftind 
markers were identical. In a previous study that included 
strains from the 1997–1998 tularemia outbreak in Spain, 
the speciﬁ c M24 allele and the RD23 deletion were found 
in 49 of 49 strains from Spain and France but in only 1 of 
189 strains from 7 northern and eastern European coun-
tries and Japan (3). The tularemia outbreak of 1997–1998 
in Spain, which resulted in >500 human cases (5), was 
thus caused by F. tularensis strains that were genetically 
closely related to strains recovered in Switzerland from 
1996 onwards, before the beginning of the outbreaks in 
Spain. This genetic relationship shows that factors other 
than the presence or introduction of a speciﬁ c clone of 
the infectious agent per se determined the magnitude of 
the tularemia outbreaks in Spain. For epidemiologists to 
understand the distribution of F. tularensis (and other 
rare disease agents) in the environment and their propaga-
tion across national and geographic borders, surveillance 
programs that include molecular analyses of these agents 
should be undertaken in multiple countries, and the result-
ing data should be shared internationally.

New Adenovirus in 
Bats, Germany 
Michael Sonntag, Kristin Mühldorfer, 
Stephanie Speck, Gudrun Wibbelt, 
and Andreas Kurth
For virologic examination, homogenized organ tissue 
was inoculated onto VeroE6/7 cells and monitored daily 
for cytopathic effects. Remaining tissue material was used 
for RNA/DNA extraction and further molecular analysis 
by generic PCR assays to detect members of several vi-
rus families including ﬂ aviviruses, hantaviruses, coronavi-
ruses, orthomyxoviruses, and paramyxoviruses. The spe-
cies of bat involved was determined by ampliﬁ cation and 
sequencing of the cytochrome B (cytB) gene, a standard 
technique for species identiﬁ cation (9).
Of the tested samples from 55 bats, virus was initially 
detected in only 2 adult common pipistrelles (P. pipistrellus, 
nos. 198/07 and 199/07). A cytopathic effect was detected 
in Vero E6/7 cells after the second passage, indicating the 
presence of virus in the cell culture. Puriﬁ ed supernatant of 
these cell cultures was subjected to negative-staining elec-
tron microscopy, which showed numerous adenovirus-like 
particles (Figure 1, panel A). The family Adenoviridae was 
We tested 55 deceased vespertilionid bats of 12 spe-
cies from southern Germany for virus infections. A new ad-
enovirus was isolated from tissue samples of 2 Pipistrellus 
pipistrellus bats, which represents the only chiropteran virus 
isolate found in Europe besides lyssavirus (rabies virus). Evi-
dence was found for adenovirus transmission between bats.
S
ince the recent discoveries of Ebola virus, Henipavi-
rus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome–associated 
coronavirus infections, interest in the role of bats as hosts 
for pathogens has markedly increased (1). With the excep-
tion of worldwide studies on bat lyssaviruses (2), most vi-
rologic investigations in bats have been limited to a particu-
lar zoonotic agent implicated in a geographically localized 
disease outbreak (3–5). In the remaining studies, various 
medically less important viruses have been discovered in 
bats in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Australia (1,6). As 
a result of increasing research efforts regarding bats and 
infectious diseases in Europe, 2 new virus groups were 
recently detected, namely beta- and gammaherpesviruses 
in organ tissue (7) and group I coronaviruses in feces of 
European vespertilionid bats (8). However, because all bat 
species in Europe/Germany are protected by strict regula-
tions, the acquisition of suitable samples for virus isolation 
is rather challenging in comparison to most other parts of 
the world.
The Study
We performed an extensive search for unknown vi-
ruses in 55 German vespertilionid bats based on both ge-
neric PCR assays and virus isolation techniques, as part 
of a broader study investigating histopathologic changes 
in German bats in association with infectious pathogens. 
Dead or moribund bats of 12 species (Barbastella barbas-
tellus, Eptesicus nilssoni, E. serotinus, Myotis daubentonii, 
M. mystacinus, Nyctalus leisleri, N. noctula, Pipistrellus 
kuhli, P. nathusii, P. pipistrellus, Plecotus auritus, and 
Vespertilio murinus) were collected at certiﬁ ed bat rehabil-
itation centers in southern Germany and were investigated 
macroscopically, bacteriologically, and histologically.

Conclusions
In contrast to Maeda et al. (12), who postulated the ne-
cessity of primary bat cells to isolate DNA virus from chi-
roptera, our isolation of a DNA virus from an European bat 
in a permanent cell line (monkey kidney cells) proved the 
opposite. We believe that the rare detection and isolation of 
viruses might be attributed to the fast natural degradation of 
bats of the suborder Microchiroptera in comparison to that 
of other animal carcasses, most likely due to their extreme-
ly low weight (2–10 g). Although viruses were not detected 
by various generic PCR assays from homogenized frozen 
tissue samples, we isolated a novel virus from a hibernating

alignment of ≈550-bp amplicons, consisting of the partial DNA 
polymerase gene of the novel bat adenovirus 2 strain Pipistrellus 
pipistrellus virus 1 (in boldface; GenBank accession no. FJ983127) 
and selected members of the family Adenoviridae, Germany. 
Alignment was analyzed with the neighbor-joining method and 
p-distance model in MEGA4 (www.megasoftware.net). Bootstrap

veriﬁ ed by the ﬁ rst reaction of a generic adenovirus-specif-
ic nested PCR (10). The obtained sequence of a fragment 
of the DNA polymerase gene (≈550 bp) indicated that the 
viruses were a novel virus type within the genus Mastade-
novirus and was tentatively named bat adenovirus 2 (bat 
AdV-2) strain P. pipistrellus virus 1 (PPV1).
To obtain additional sequence information of bat 
AdV-2, a random PCR method (virus discovery based on 
cDNA–ampliﬁ ed fragment length polymorphism) (11) 
was applied, which showed >20 adenovirus sequences dis-
tributed over the genome (Figure 1, panel B). The partial 
sequence of the bat AdV-2 DNA polymerase (3,408 bp; 
GenBank accession no. FJ983127) was obtained after Lon-
gRange PCR by using the Expand Long Range dNTPack 
(Roche, Mannheim, Germany) according to the manufac-
turer’s directions and the following 2 primers: ABS F1-B 
(5′-AAAAgAggCAAAgCAAgACAgTgg-3′) and ABS 
R2-B (5′-ggCgggCAACAAAgACCTCA-3′). After repeat-
ed sequence analysis of the partial DNA polymerase gene 
for validation, we found that the identities of bat AdV-2 
PPV1 to closely related adenoviruses ranged from 68% to 
74% on nucleic acid level (Table 1), with the closest rela-
tionship found to canine adenoviruses 1 and 2. So far, the 
only other adenovirus in bats has been accidentally isolated 
from primary bat kidney cells of a healthy Ryukyu ﬂ ying 
fox (Pteropus dasymallus yayeyamae) (12), which proved 
to have a rather distant phylogenetic relationship to bat 
AdV-2 (Figure 2).
On the basis of newly acquired sequence informa-
tion, we designed a speciﬁ c real-time TaqMan PCR 
to detect bat AdV-2 (ABS forward 5′-CACAAgTgg
TgTCTTTgAgAgCA-3′, ABS reverse 5′-AgAgggATAC
AAACTgATggAAACA-3′, ABS TM 6FAM-CTAACTT-
ggCTggTggAgTgCgAAAC-q). Cycler conditions were as 
follows: predenaturation (95°C for 10 min), 45 ampliﬁ ca-
tion cycles (95°C for 30 s, 61°C for 30 s, 72°C for 30 s), 
and ﬁ nal extension (72°C for 10 min).
After screening all 55 bats from Germany of 12 spe-
cies, comprising an additional 11 common pipistrelles, an 
identical adenovirus was detected in 1 additional common 
pipistrelle. Moreover, the tissue tropism of bat AdV-2 was 
investigated in all 3 infected bats (Table 2). Of all tested or-
gans, bat AdV-2 was detected in high DNA copy numbers 
in the intestine of all 3 bats with lesser DNA copy numbers 
in liver and kidneys, whereas the other organs contained lit-
tle or no adenovirus DNA. Unfortunately, due to advanced 
tissue decomposition in most of the organs, including liver,

insectivorous bat species. This virus was detected in high 
DNA copy numbers in the intestine of 3 bats that died of 
natural causes.
The fact that no other viral or bacterial agents were de-
tected in these animals suggests a clinical correlation to the 
isolated adenovirus. Moreover, all 3 bats belonged to the 
same species and were of similar age. Several days before 
their death, they were found moribund and subsequently 
admitted together to the rehabilitation center, which high-
lights the strong likelihood of infection in the colony of ori-
gin. Cross-contamination during tissue preparation can be 
excluded because sterilized instruments were used for each 
animal, and after every incision, instruments were cleaned 
with 70% ethanol and a Bunsen burner ﬂ ame to destroy 
adhering tissue remnants.
Various adenovirus types of the genus Mastdenovirus 
infect a range of different mammals and cause respiratory, 
ocular, and gastrointestinal diseases. Here, in all 3 infected 
bats, the highest copy number of adenovirus DNA was de-
tected in the intestine, which suggests a correlation with a 
gastrointestinal disease. The host range of mastadenovirus-
es is known to be limited to a single (or a few closely relat-
ed) mammalian species (13) with a probable co-evolution 
between virus and their hosts (14). The acquired partial se-
quence of the bat AdV-2 DNA polymerase with the closest 
relation to canine adenovirus (only 74% at the nucleic acid 
level) and the isolation from a new animal host suggests 
that this virus is a new adenovirus species within the genus 
Mastadenovirus. A comparison to the only other adenovi-
rus found in a bat (ﬂ ying fox, order Megachiroptera) with 
the available sequence information of a ≈550-bp fragment 
of the DNA polymerase gene showed their distant relation-
ship. This strict separation reﬂ ects either the co-evolution-
ary development between the 2 adenoviruses (bat AdV-1 
FBV1, bat AdV-2 PPV1) and their host families Pteropodi-
dae and Vespertilionidae or a host switch of the virus origi-
nating from a yet-undetermined vertebrate host. To eluci-
date this problem, further research will be necessary.
In conclusion, we isolated a new virus from free-
ranging vespertilionid bats, which represents the only chi-
ropteran virus isolate besides lyssavirus (rabies) found in 
Europe. Moreover, the detection of this chiropteran virus 
can be connected with its transmission between individual 
bats living in close proximity to other bats.

Human Trichinosis 
after Consumption 
of Soft-Shelled 
Turtles, Taiwan

In 2008, an outbreak of human trichinosis associated 
with ingestion of raw soft-shelled turtles was identiﬁ ed and 
investigated in Taiwan. The data suggested that patients 
were likely infected with Trichinella papuae.
T
richinosis is a zoonotic disease caused by species of the 
nematode Trichinella. In eastern Asia, human trichi-
nosis has been reported in the People’s Republic of China, 
Japan, and Korea (1–4). Trichinosis among humans and 
animals has not been reported in Taiwan (1,5,6). Although 
the major source of human infection is the meat of mam-
mals, reptiles recently have been found to serve as hosts 
for certain Trichinella species. T. zimbabwensis, detected 
in the muscles of Nile crocodiles (Crocodylus niloticus) in 
Zimbabwe in 1995, is the ﬁ rst species of Trichinella found 
in a reptile host naturally infected with Trichinella (7). No 
human infection has been documented. Another species, 
T. papuae, was detected in a farmed saltwater crocodile in 
Papua New Guinea in 2004 (8). A trichinosis outbreak in 
humans caused by T. papuae, associated with eating wild 
boar meat, occurred in Thailand (9). Trichinosis in humans 
related to consumption of reptile meat was ﬁ rst described in 
Thailand; the source was turtle and brown lizard meat (10). 
We report an outbreak of human trichinosis in Taiwan in 
which eating raw soft-shelled turtles (Pelodiscus sinensis) 
was the suspected mode of infection.
The Study
In July 2008, four teaching hospitals in northern Tai-
wan consecutively reported to the Department of Health 
of Taipei City Government (DHTCG) and the Centers for 
Disease Control (CDC) 8 patients in 2 groups in whom

fever, myalgias, and eosinophilia of unknown cause de-
veloped after they shared a common food source in May 
2008. Group A, comprising 20 Taiwanese, participated in 
a festive meal in Taipei City at a Japanese food restau-
rant, and were served raw meat, blood, liver, and eggs 
of 3 of the 5 soft-shelled turtles provided by the host, a 
supplier of soft-shelled turtles. The other 2 soft-shelled 
turtles were refrigerated at 4°C and served at the same 
restaurant to a group of 3 Japanese customers (group B) 
6 days later.
DHTCG and Taiwan CDC jointly investigated this 
outbreak. The restaurant had never previously served raw 
or undercooked soft-shelled turtles. Restaurant patrons 
other than those in groups A and B did not eat raw or un-
dercooked soft-shelled turtles. Five of the 20 Taiwanese in 
group A and the 3 Japanese in group B exhibited signs and 
symptoms 1–3 weeks after eating at the restaurant and were 
deﬁ ned as case-patients (Table 1). The 15 asymptomatic 
persons were deﬁ ned as controls.
The most common symptoms were myalgia (88%), fe-
ver (88%), malaise (63%), and periorbital swelling (38%). 
Seven case-patients whose blood was analyzed all had eo-
sinophilia and increased serum creatine phosphokinase and 
alanine aminotransferase levels. Five case-patients were 
hospitalized. Two patients underwent extensive serologic 
testing for helminths by ELISA, including tests for Diroﬁ -
laria immitis, Toxocara canis, Ascaris lumbricoides, Ani-
sakis spp., Gnathostoma spinigerum, Strongyloides sterc-
oralis, Paragonimus westermanii, Paragonimus miyazakii, 
Fasciola hepatica, Clonorchis sinensis, Spirometra eri-
nacei, Taenia solium, and Trichinella spp. Both patients 
had weakly positive results for A. lumbricoides, G. spini-
gerum, and S. stercoralis and strongly reactive results for 
Trichinella spp.
Serum samples from 5 patients during the acute phase 
(3–5 weeks postexposure) and from all 8 patients during 
the convalescent phase (7–9 weeks postexposure) were 
sent to the Department of Parasitology, Gifu University, 
Gifu, Japan, for Trichinella serologic diagnosis, with ELI-
SA and immunohistochemical staining. Of the 15 controls, 
none consented to give a blood sample. Brieﬂ y, the ELISA 
microtiter plates were sensitized with excretory-secretory 
(ES) antigen from T. spiralis or T. pseudospiralis, probed 
with a diluted human serum sample (1:200–1:6,400), and 
incubated with 100 μL of 1:10,000-diluted goat antihuman 
immunoglobulin G (Fab speciﬁ c) peroxidase-conjugate 
(Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO, USA). Absorbance 
at 414 nm was monitored with a plate reader. All samples 
were analyzed in duplicate. The cutoff point was 3× the 
mean values of the A414 for the negative controls. Immu-
nohistochemical staining was performed by incubating 
skeletal muscle tissues from T. spiralis–infected mice with 
the serum specimens (1:200 dilution) for 1 h at 37°C and

available from the restaurant for analysis. The soft-shelled 
turtles were bred artiﬁ cially and hatched on a farm in Tai-
wan. They were fed only indigenous ﬁ sh and shellﬁ sh. 
The farm used neither imported feed nor feed containing 
any mammals or reptiles. Microscopic inspection, with a 
meat-digesting method, of the soft-shelled turtles obtained 
from the farm 2 months after the outbreak did not show 
Trichinella spp. After the investigation, Taiwan CDC is-
sued a press release to describe the outbreak and alert the 
public of the risk for trichinosis from eating raw or under-
cooked soft-shelled turtles.
processing the sections with the HistoStain SP kit (Zymed 
Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA, USA).
In both the acute and convalescent phases, all serum 
samples reacted to T. spiralis and T. pseudospiralis ES 
antigen and were positive in immunohistochemical stain-
ing (Table 1). The diagnosis of trichinosis was conﬁ rmed. 
Mebendazole or albendazole was prescribed for all patients, 
and their symptoms gradually resolved.
We conducted semistructured interviews with the 8 
case-patients and 15 controls in both groups to learn which 
food items they had eaten at the restaurant. None had eaten 
raw or undercooked soft-shelled turtles before this outbreak 
(Table 2). In univariate analysis, consumption of raw soft-
shelled turtle meat was strongly associated with infection 
(p = 0.003). Trichinosis developed in 8 (62%) of the 13 
persons who ate raw soft-shelled turtle meat.
We performed an environmental study of the restau-
rant and the soft-shelled turtle farm. No leftover food was 
Conclusions
The incubation period, clinical features, and labora-
tory ﬁ ndings in this outbreak are similar to those of other 
reported trichinosis outbreaks associated with eating mam-
mals (11,12). T. papuae and T. zimbabwensis are the most 
likely parasites causing this outbreak because of their abil-

ity to infect mammals and reptiles (13). The ELISA method 
has limited speciﬁ city because of cross-reactions with non-
Trichinella helminths (14). Moreover, because of similar 
antigen patterns among all Trichinella spp., the antigens 
prepared with 1 species can be used to detect speciﬁ c anti-
bodies in patients infected with any species (1). Therefore, 
although we detected strongly reactive antibodies to T. 
spiralis and T. pseudospiralis, we could not determine the 
etiologic Trichinella sp. in this outbreak without parasitic 
diagnosis.
A recent study demonstrated that the 53-kDa recombi-
nant proteins in larval ES products could provide species-
speciﬁ c antibody responses in Trichinella-infected mice 
(15). We assessed the absorbance at 414 nm with a 1:200-
diluted serum sample in our patients by using the 53-kDa 
recombinant proteins expressed from 5 Trichinella species 
(T. spiralis, T. britovi, T. nativa, T. pseudospiralis, and T. 
papuae). Our preliminary results showed that convales-
cent-phase serum specimens from 6 of the 8 case-patients 
reacted most strongly to the 53-kDa recombinant protein 
of T. papuae. Although application of this method in spe-
cies-speciﬁ c human diagnosis requires further studies, the 
data suggest our patients were likely to be infected with 
T. papuae. Because we have not yet determined how soft-
shelled turtles were infected by T. papuae in this outbreak, 
further investigation of the potential infectious source is 
warranted.
Persons in many parts of the world typically consume 
raw or uncooked reptile meat. Further investigations are ur-
gently needed to assess the epidemiology of reptile trichi-
nosis and the human risk for trichinosis from reptiles.

piric antimicrobial drugs such as 
linezolid (Pﬁ zer, Inc, New York,

from ECMO on hospital day (HD)

cardiovascular evaluation showed 
normal biventricular function and no 
coronary disease. She was discharged 
from hospital for rehabilitation on 
September 15, 2009 (HD 22), with an 
oxygen saturation of 98% on room air 
and is now fully recovered.
The use of ECMO is an estab-
lished option for patients with medi-
cally refractory acute and reversible 
cardiopulmonary failure (1–3) (Table). 
For isolated respiratory failure, veno–
veno support can be used by femoral 
vein to femoral vein or femoral vein to 
right internal jugular vein cannulation. 
With concomitant cardiogenic shock, 
veno–arterial cannulation may be re-
quired with cannulation of the right 
internal jugular or femoral vein for 
outﬂ ow, and for inﬂ ow, the femoral 
artery directly or the axillary artery by 
a surgically placed side graft. Central 
venous (right atrium) and arterial (as-
cending aorta) cannulation is an option 
but requires median sternotomy.

To the Editor: As the world strug-
gles with the challenges of inﬂ uenza A 
pandemic (H1N1) 2009, it is clear that 
treatment options for critically ill in-
fected patients are suboptimal because 
deaths continue to be reported in oth-
erwise young and healthy patients. Ex-
tracorporeal membrane oxygenation 
(ECMO) is an established therapeutic 
option for patients with medically re-
fractory cardiogenic or respiratory fail-
ure. We describe the successful use of 
ECMO in a patient with complicated 
pneumonia and inﬂ uenza A pandemic 
(H1N1) 2009 virus infection. 
Our patient, a 21-year-old woman 
who was 4 months postpartum, had 
poorly controlled insulin-dependent 
diabetes (hemoglobin A1C level 13.2 
mg/dL). She sought treatment at an-
other hospital after 3 days of respira-
tory symptoms, a productive cough af-
ter working in her garden, and a fever 
>103°F. Her condition rapidly dete-
riorated, and she required mechanical 
ventilation, vasoactive medications, 
and drotecogin-α (Xigris; Eli Lilly and 
Company, Indianapolis, IN, USA) for 
profound shock. 
The patient was then transferred 
to Ohio State University Medical 
Center on August 24, 2009; at admis-
sion she exhibited hypotension (83/43 
mm Hg) and tachycardia (159 bpm), 
despite having received high doses of 
vasoactive medications (norepineph-
rine 1.0 μg/kg/min, phenylephrine 2.0 
μg/kg/min). A transthoracic echocar-
diograph showed severe biventricular 
failure (ejection fraction 5%–10%); 
peak tropinin level was 6 mg/dL. Arte-
rial blood gas conﬁ rmed metabolic ac-
idosis (pH 7.12, partial carbon dioxide

limited success for complications of 
pandemic (H1N1) 2009 (5). Its broad-
er use in treating critically ill patients 
has been limited, however, because 
ECMO requires substantial institution-
al and multidisciplinary commitment 
for implementation and is typically 
only available at major medical centers 
offering cardiovascular surgery.
Although we cannot say speciﬁ -
cally why our patient survived, clearly, 
aggressive and comprehensive empiric 
treatment, physiologic support, and 
close multidisciplinary communication 
were vital to managing the condition of 
this critically ill patient. ECMO may 
have assisted in organ recovery and pa-
tient survival. However, further studies 
should be conducted to critically evalu-
ate ECMO in the armamentarium of 
therapeutic options for severe pandem-
ic (H1N1) 2009 respiratory failure.

type H1N1 (2). At the Hospital Central 
de San Isidro, a tertiary hospital of 160 
beds in the Province of Buenos Aires, 
initial clinical evaluation of patients 
with ILI symptoms included physical 
examination and, eventually, chest ra-
diograph and pulse oximetry. Because 
diagnostic resources were limited, pa-
tients with ILI were eligible to receive 
oseltamivir with no prior sampling for 
respiratory pathogens. A standardized 
form was used for prescription and 
data collection, including demographic 
data, history of inﬂ uenza vaccination, 
date symptoms began, and coexisting 
illnesses. From June 16 to July 5, a 
total of 2,135 patients with ILI were 
evaluated. The age of patients ranged 
from 14 to 82 years of age (median, 
35 years); 854 patients (40 %) were 
male. Because of lower respiratory 
disease, a total of 166 (8%) of 2,135 
patients were admitted to the internal 
medicine ward (n = 139) or to the in-
tensive care unit (n = 27). At admis-
sion, patients had >1 of the following: 
diffuse pulmonary inﬁ ltrates, room air 
oxygen saturation <95%, crackles on 
auscultation. Other clinical manifes-
tations were not statistically different 
from those already reported in patients 
with pandemic (H1N1) 2009 in the 
United States, including cough, fever, 
and sore throat (3). The most common 
radiology pattern was basal, and bi-
lateral interstitial inﬁ ltrates were con-
sistent with primary viral pneumonia. 
Notably, some patients had clinical 
radiologic dissociation characterized 
by cough and pulmonary inﬁ ltrates in 
the absence of fever. Median time of 
hospitalization was 36 hours (range 
1–25 days). No signiﬁ cant differences 
were observed between the groups 
of patients that were admitted versus 
outpatients in terms of age, sex, num-
ber of days from initiation of fever 
to ﬁ rst hospital visit, and history of 
inﬂ uenza vaccination. A total of 163 
(98%) of 166 patients admitted to the 
hospital during the observation pe-
riod were discharged with no further 
complications.

May 2009 in travelers returning from 
Mexico and the United States. In mid-
June, a sharp increase was reported 
in the number of patients with acute 
respiratory symptoms who were seek-
ing treatment in emergency rooms. By 
July 9th, the Argentinean Ministry of 
Health had conﬁ rmed 2,677 cases and 
82 deaths; most of those infected were 
residents of Buenos Aires and the sur-
rounding area (1). When the World 
Health Organization raised the pan-

Susceptibility of 
Poultry to Pandemic 
(H1N1) 2009 Virus
Patients admitted to the hospital 
with pulmonary inﬁ ltrates were em-
pirically treated with high dose oselta-
mivir (150 mg 2×/d) for 5 days, other 
antimicrobial drugs, and, eventually, 
steroids. In 2 patients, the respira-
tory disease progressed initially but 
they eventually recovered; 2 patients 
(1.2% of admissions to hospital) with 
acute respiratory failure died. Despite 
improvement in clinical symptoms 
at discharge, chest radiographs per-
formed on a limited number of pa-
tients showed no substantial changes 
at 72–96 h after admission.
Clinical manifestations of pan-
demic (H1N1) 2009 have not yet been 
fully characterized. We observed a 
mild to moderate lower respiratory 
disease in ≈8% of consecutive patients 
with ILI during the current pandemic 
in Argentina. A more severe respira-
tory disease was observed in Mexico 
during the current pandemic (4) In 
contrast, early reports indicated that 
pandemic (H1N1) 2009 disease might 
be similar in severity to seasonal inﬂ u-
enza (3). A lack of microbiologic con-
ﬁ rmation may bias our observation. 
Because pulmonary inﬁ ltrates are un-
common in previously healthy persons 
with ILI, a simultaneous circulation of 
other respiratory pathogens may ex-
plain our observation. Furthermore, 
early empirical use of antimicrobial 
drugs could overshadow clinical fea-
tures of bacterial pneumonia.
We observed an unexpectedly 
high rate of lower respiratory disease 
in adults with ILI during an outbreak 
of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 in Argenti-
na. This ﬁ nding suggests that a unique 
pattern of virulence, pulmonary tro-
pism, or both may characterize the 
current inﬂ uenza A (H1N1) infection, 
although we could not rule out co-in-
fection with other viral or bacterial re-
spiratory pathogens. Considering the 
evolving nature of inﬂ uenza viruses, 
the wide clinical spectrum of pan-
demic (H1N1) 2009 should be further 
investigated.
To the Editor: During April 
2009, cases of acute respiratory dis-
ease in humans caused by inﬂ uenza 
A pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus in 
Mexico were reported (1). By Au-
gust 21, 2009, a total of >182,166 
human cases, including 1,799 deaths, 
had been reported from 177 countries 
(www.who.int/csr/don/2009_08_21/
en/index.html). 
The origin of the new virus ap-
pears to be a reassortant event of a 
virus from swine in North America 
that contained the classic swine, hu-
man, and avian inﬂ uenza genes and a 
virus of unknown origin that contrib-
uted neuraminidase and matrix genes 
of swine in Europe. On May 2, 2009, 
the ﬁ rst nonhuman infections were de-
tected in a swine operation in Canada 
(www.who.int/csr/don/2009_06_24/
en/index.html).
Historically, human seasonal in-
ﬂ uenza A viruses have not been report-
ed to infect poultry, but clinical cases 
of respiratory disease or reduction in 
egg production have been reported for 
domestic turkeys after infection with 
subtypes H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2 
swine inﬂ uenza viruses and for mul-
tiple poultry species with subtype 
H1N1 avian inﬂ uenza virus (2–4). 
The presence of avian and swine inﬂ u-
enza virus genes in pandemic (H1N1) 
2009 virus increases the potential for 
infection in poultry after exposure to 
infected humans or swine.
To determine infectivity potential, 
3-week-old chickens (Gallus domes-
ticus) (n = 11), 2-week-old domestic 
ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) (n = 11), 
73-week-old reproductively active 
turkey hens (Meleagris gallopavo) (n 
= 9), 3-week-old turkey poults (n = 
11), and 5-week-old Japanese quail 
(Coturnix japonica) (n = 11) were 
intranasally inoculated with 106 mean 
chicken embryo infectious doses of 
A/Mexico/4108/2009(H1N1). 
Five 
uninfected chickens, ducks, turkey 
poults, and quail, and 3 uninfected 
turkey hens were contact exposed to 
intranasally inoculated birds to as-
sess transmission potential. Cloacal 
and oropharyngeal swabs were taken 
on 2, 4, 7, and 10 days postinocula-
tion (DPI) from all birds, and internal 
tissues were taken from 2 birds on 2, 
4 and 7 DPI for virus detection by 
quantitative real-time reverse tran-
scription–PCR (qRRT-PCR) assay

Infection with swine inﬂ uenza 
viruses in turkeys has been frequently 
reported, and experimental intrana-
sal inoculation studies using 5 such 
viruses have produced infection and 
disease with associated contact trans-
mission to uninfected turkeys (3,4,6). 
However, infection of chickens by 
swine inﬂ uenza viruses has been rare 
in the ﬁ eld, and experimental studies 
have shown limited respiratory repli-
cation after intranasal inoculation but 
no transmission (3,6–8). Experimental 
inoculation of ducks failed to produce 
infection or transmission (8).
Recently, subtype H3N2 swine 
inﬂ uenza A virus infection with respi-
ratory disease in Japanese quail has 
been reported in Canada, and such 
infections have been experimentally 
reproduced by intranasal inoculation 
(9,10). However, in our studies, pan-
demic (H1N1) 2009 virus was bio-
logically distinct from swine inﬂ uenza 
viruses, failing to produce infection in 
experimentally inoculated turkey hens 
or chickens, and only 1 serologically 
positive IN-inoculated domestic duck. 
In addition, Japanese quail were in-
fected by high dose IN exposure, but 
replication and shedding was limited 
to the respiratory tract, and the virus 
did not transmit to quail by contact, 
suggesting low potential of poultry in-
volvement as an ampliﬁ cation host for 
current pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus. 
Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus is un-
likely to produce sustained outbreaks 
in poultry unless the virus mutates or 
reassorts with existing avian inﬂ uenza 
viruses. Since the submission of this 
report, the virus has been detected in 
2 turkey ﬂ ocks in Chile (www.oie.
int/wahis,/public.php?page=single_
speciﬁ c for the inﬂ uenza virus matrix 
gene (5).
To improve sensitivity because 
of several primer mismatches, we 
updated the reverse primer to 3′-
CAGAGACTGGAAAGTGTCTTT
GCA-5′. Virus isolation in embryonat-
ing chicken eggs was used on a sub-
set of samples to verify qRRT-PCR 
results at 4 DPI. Serum samples were 
collected on 15 DPI for antibody test-
ing by hemagglutination inhibition. 
Shams were intranasally inoculated 
with culture media and sampled on 
4 and/or 7 DPI. We inoculated ten 4 
week-old chickens intravenously to 
determine pathotype by using the in-
travenous pathogenicity index (IVPI). 
All animal studies were conducted un-
der BioSafety Level 3 enhanced con-
ditions with approval by Institutional 
Animal Care and Use and BioSafety 
committees.
During the 15-day observation 
period, clinical signs did not develop 
in any of the birds; none of the birds 
died. An IVPI of 0.00 indicated the vi-
rus was not of high pathogenicity for 
chickens. No virus was detected by 
qRRT-PCR or isolated in chicken eggs 
from swabs or tissues from chickens, 
turkeys, or ducks. All chickens and 
turkeys were negative for antibodies to 
the virus on 15 DPI, but 1 intranasally 
inoculated duck had a hemagglutina-
tion inhibition (HI) antibody titer of 
16. Virus was detected in oropharyn-
geal swabs at 2 and 4 DPI from intra-
nasally (IN)–inoculated quail (Table), 
and these quail had antibodies against 
inﬂ uenza A at 15 DPI. The intranasally 
inoculated quail had heterophilic-to-
lymphocytic rhinitis, and inﬂ uenza 
virus was visualized by immunohis-
tochemical analysis of epithelium and 
macrophages within the mucosa of the 
nasal cavity; neither lesions nor anti-
gen were identiﬁ ed in other respira-
tory and nonrespiratory tissues. Virus 
was not isolated from contact-exposed 
quail (Table), and they lacked antibod-
ies on 15 DPI.

To the Editor: Oropouche virus 
(OROV) is an arbovirus, Orthobu-
nyavirus, transmitted among sloths, 
marsupials, primates, and birds by the 
mosquitoes Aedes serratus and Culex 
quinquefasciatus. Notably, this virus 
has adapted to an urban cycle involving 
man, with midges (Culicoides paraen-
sis) as the main vector (1). Oropouche 
fever is the second most frequent ar-
boviral disease in Brazil, surpassed 
only by dengue. OROV causes large, 
explosive outbreaks of acute febrile 
illness in cities and villages in the Am-
azon and central regions of Brazil. An 
estimated 500,000 cases of OROV in-
fection have occurred in Brazil in the 
past 48 years. In addition to outbreaks, 
OROV can also cause sporadic human 
infections (2).
The Tropical Medicine Founda-
tion of Amazonas State (TMF-AM) 
is a tertiary care center specializing 
in tropical and infectious diseases and 
is located in the city of Manaus. Syn-
dromic surveillance for acute febrile 
illness has been conducted by TMF-
AM since 1998.  During January 2007 
through November 2008, we obtained 
blood samples from 631 patients who 
had acute febrile illness for ≥5 days 
but who had negative results at ini-
tial screening for malaria (thick blood 
smear) and dengue (MAC-ELISA). 
Blood samples were tested for OROV 
immunoglobulin (Ig) M antibodies by 
an indirect enzyme immune assay us-
ing infected cells as antigen, as previ-
ously reported for dengue (3).
For the indirect enzyme immune 
assay using infected cells as antigen, 
C6/36 A. albopictus cells were grown 
in 96 well microplates; these cells 
were infected with OROV (BeAn 1991 
strain). After 4 days, the cells were 
ﬁ xed in the wells with 7% formalin 
buffered at pH 7.0. The microplate was 
blocked with 5% skim milk and, after 
washing the wells, 100 μL of serum 
diluted 1:400 was added into infected 
and uninfected wells. After incubation 
and washing the wells, a peroxidase-
conjugated goat anti-human IgM was 
added; ﬁ nally, the ABTS substrate 
(KPL, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD, USA) 
was added into the wells. The plates 
were incubated and read on a spec-
trophotometer at 405 nm. The cutoff 
for the test was determined to be the 
mean of optical densities read in all 
wells containing uninfected cells plus 
3 standard deviations.
Of the 631 patients in the study, 
128 (20.3%) had IgM antibodies to 
OROV. The age range was 2–81 years 
(mean 29.5 ± 14 years), and 77 (60.2%) 
were women or girls. Most of the cas-
es occurred November through March 
during the rainy season. In addition 
to fever, the patients had headache 
(93 [72.7%]), myalgia (90 [70.3%]), 
and arthralgia (74 [57.8%]). Rash was 
observed in 54 patients (42.2%), and 
hemorrhagic phenomena (petechiae, 
epistaxis, and gingival bleeding) were 
observed in 20 patients (15.5%). All 
patients recovered without sequelae 
and were not hospitalized.
Despite the knowledge of the oc-
currence of several arboviruses in the 
Amazon region, most cases of arbo-
viral diseases remain undiagnosed, 
probably because of their generally 
mild and self-limited clinical mani-
festations.  Patients usually recover 
completely after a couple of days. 
However, even more severe cases 
may remain undiagnosed, especially 
because of long distances to health 
care facilities, difﬁ culties in sample 
transportation, and lack of laboratory 
facilities capable of conducting the di-
agnostic assays. With regard to OROV 
infections, diagnosis of OROV may 
be easily confused with other acute 
febrile illness, including malaria and 
dengue, both of which are highly en-
demic in Manaus.
In the present study, an inhouse 
enzyme immune assay for IgM using 
infected cell culture as antigen was

Identical Strains of

found suitable for the diagnosis of 
OROV infections in the acute phase. 
Thus, a combination of a systematic 
surveillance for acute febrile illnesses 
and efﬁ cient laboratory diagnosis for 
OROV resulted in the discovery of an 
outbreak, which would probably have 
been overlooked if it had occurred in 
any region simultaneously with large 
dengue outbreaks or in the absence 
of laboratory diagnosis. The cases of 
OROV fever reported here likely rep-
resent a small portion of the cases; a 
much higher number of cases prob-
ably occurred in Manaus during the 
study period.
The clinical characteristics of 
most cases of OROV fever in this 
outbreak were similar to previously 
reported descriptions of the illness. 
Notably, however, 20 (15.5%) pa-
tients from Manaus had spontaneous 
hemorrhagic phenomena (petecchiae, 
epistaxis, and gingival bleeding) that 
had not previously been described in 
OROV fever (4–6). Moreover, symp-
toms of involvement of the central 
nervous system were not observed.
In recent years, the area of cir-
culation and the epidemic potential 
of OROV have increased, and this 
virus has emerged as a public health 
problem in Brazil and other countries 
in the Americas. Presently, OROV 
is the most common of the Brazilian 
zoonotic arboviruses infecting humans 
(7). Further evidence of the spread of 
OROV was its isolation in 2003 from 
a small primate, a marmoset (Cal-
lithrix), in the state of Minas Gerais in 
southeast Brazil, far from the Amazon 
region (8). Considering that midges 
(Culicoides paraensis) occur in most 
low altitude areas of the Americas, it 
is conceivable that environmental de-
struction and climate changes could 
result in OROV outbreaks in the large 
cities of Brazil, as well as in other parts 
of the Western Hemisphere (9).

To the Editor: On August 5, 
1994, a northern spotted owl, Strix 
occidentalis 
caurina, 
was 
found 
dead in Kittitas County, Washington, 
USA (1). A thorough investigation 
and necropsy identiﬁ ed the probable 
cause of death to be a spirochete in-
fection. The organisms were seen in 
sections of the bird’s liver with use of 
modiﬁ ed Steiner silver stain and mi-
croscopy. DNA was extracted from 
the infected liver, and PCR–DNA se-
quencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA 
(rRNA) locus identiﬁ ed the bacterium 
as a relapsing fever spirochete related 
most closely to Borrelia hermsii (1). 
The lack of additional data surround-
ing this case precluded Thomas et al. 
from concluding that this spirochete

vestigation (1) (provided by Alan G. 
Barbour). We successfully PCR am-
pliﬁ ed most of the 16S rDNA and the 
complete ﬂ aB, gyrB, glpQ, and vtp 
genes from the owl spirochete DNA 
and determined their sequences. The 
complete sequences of the ﬁ rst 4 loci 
from the owl and squirrel spirochetes 
were identical and differed from all 
other B. hermsii sequences. A phylo-
gram of the concatenated sequences 
totaling 5,188 bases demonstrated 
that the owl and pine squirrel spiro-
chetes were identical and were diver-
gent members of B. hermsii genomic 
group I (Figure).
Finding the same strain of B. 
hermsii, separated by ≈525 km, in a 
pine squirrel and a spotted owl demon-
strates a broader geographic distribu-
tion and host range for this spirochete 
than what could have been envisaged 
previously. The possible role of birds 
as hosts for the vector Ornithodoros 
hermsi ticks has been demonstrated 
elsewhere (4). Given the ecologic 
overlap of pine squirrels and conifer-
ous forest-dwelling birds, we believe 
that the previous ﬁ nding of the infect-
ed spotted owl is likely not an isolated 
event. Instead, it may represent a tick–
spirochete cycle for B. hermsii that 
includes a broader host range for this 
group of relapsing fever spirochetes 
than previously appreciated.
BSK-H medium after passage in the 
laboratory mouse; however, we ac-
quired DNA sequences from infected 
squirrel and mouse blood from PCR 
amplicons for 6 spirochete loci in-
cluding 16S rDNA, ﬂ aB, gyrB, glpQ, 
IGS, and vtp. Sequences for the loci 
were each aligned with homologous 
sequences from other borrelia in our 
collection, and each locus grouped 
the spirochete within the 2 genomic 
groups of B. hermsii described previ-
ously (4,6). The unique squirrel spiro-
chete differed from all other B. hermsii 
identiﬁ ed in our previous studies; deep 
branches in each phylogram grouped 
the spirochete more closely with B. 
hermsii genomic group I than with ge-
nomic group II (data not shown).
Next, we compared the sequenc-
es from the squirrel spirochete with 
those available in the National Cen-
ter for Biotechnology Information 
database 
(www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), 
including those sequences reported 
for the spirochete found in the spot-
ted owl (AY515269.1, AF116903.1,  
AF116904.1) (1,2). The 3 trimmed 
and aligned sequences for the 16S 
rDNA (1,290 bases), ﬂ aB (467 bas-
es), and IGS (665 bases) from the 
squirrel spirochete were identical 
to those of the owl spirochete; no 
base differences were found among 
the 2,422 bases compared. We also 
examined DNA extracted from the 
spotted owl’s liver during the ﬁ rst in-
infecting the owl was B. hermsii (1). 
Yet, in a subsequent analysis using the 
intergenic spacer region, the owl spi-
rochete was included with isolates of 
B. hermsii (2).
To investigate the distribution and 
prevalence of B. hermsii , during the 
summer of 2008, we began a study at 
Flathead Lake, Lake County, Montana, 
USA, where 9 persons have contract-
ed relapsing fever since 2002 (3–5). A 
blood smear from 1 pine squirrel (Ta-
miasciurus hudsonicus) captured July 
9 at Yellow Bay on the east shore of the 
lake (elevation 887 m; geographic co-
ordinates 47°52′35′′N, 114°01′54′′W) 
contained spirochetes detected when 
stained with Giemsa and examined 
by microscopy (600× brightﬁ eld with 
oil immersion). Whole blood from the 
squirrel contained live spirochetes vis-
ible by dark-ﬁ eld microscopy, and ≈50 
μL of this blood was injected intrap-
eritoneally into a laboratory mouse. 
The next day, a few spirochetes were 
observed in the peripheral blood of the 
mouse, and during the next 3 days, the 
density of spirochetes increased. We 
used intracardiac puncture to collect 
blood from the mouse for spirochete 
isolation in BSK-H medium (Sigma-
Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) and for 
analysis by PCR and DNA sequencing 
of multiple bacterial loci as described 
elsewhere (4,6).
 The spirochetes observed in 
the squirrel’s blood failed to grow in

TB in the liver, lungs, and mesenter-
ic lymph nodes. Five (0.36%) goats 
were conﬁ rmed positive by culture 
as described (2). Deletion typing (6) 
with the RD9 deletion was used to 
distinguish M. tuberculosis from other 
members of the MTC. Those isolates 
with a deletion in this region were fur-
ther investigated with primers speciﬁ c 
for RD4. This reaction distinguishes 
between M. bovis, M. caprae, and oth-
er members of the MTC. Spoligotyp-
ing was performed as described (7) to 
type an M. tuberculosis isolate from a 
goat after identiﬁ cation of this bacte-
rium by deletion typing.
We isolated 4 strains of M. bovis 
and 1 strain of M. tuberculosis from 
the goats (Table). Spoligotyping 
identiﬁ ed the M. tuberculosis isolate 
as belonging to the East African In-
dian (EAI)–5 family in the SpolDB4 
database. All M. bovis isolates were 
M. bovis bovis, not M. bovis caprae, 
according to their deletion typing 
proﬁ le (6). One M. bovis isolate was 
obtained from a male goat; the 3 re-
maining M. bovis isolates and the M. 
tuberculosis isolate were obtained 
from female goats.
Epidemiologic inferences can be 
made from the results of our study. 
First, M. bovis, which is naturally 
found in cattle, was isolated from 4 
slaughtered goats. Although M. bo-
vis caprae was the M. bovis variant 
most frequently isolated from goats in 
some areas (8), in our study, only M. 
bovis bovis was isolated. This ﬁ nd-
ing is consistent with results reported 
by Crawshaw et al. (9), and suggests 
transmission from cattle, rather than 
transmission from the goat reservoir. 
Second, because the infected goats 
were adult females, infection may be 
transmitted to their offspring. Third, M. 
tuberculosis was isolated from a goat. 
Its presence in this goat may have been 
caused by direct transmission from hu-
mans because this bacterium may be a 
natural pathogen of humans.
Transmission caused by close

To the Editor: Documentation 
of possible tuberculosis (TB) in goats 
in Nigeria was reported by Ojo (1) on 
the basis of gross lesions without cul-
ture conﬁ rmation. Livestock owners 
in Nigeria normally graze cattle and 
goats together, and this practice poses 
a high risk for transmission of bovine 
TB among these animals (1). This 
practice is especially a threat to goats 
in Nigeria because several reports 
have described bovine TB in cattle 
in Nigeria (2–5). However, reports of 
diagnosis of TB in goats in Nigeria 
are lacking.
Molecular epidemiologic tech-
niques such as deletion typing and 
spoligotyping have been used to char-
acterize members of the Mycobac-
terium tuberculosis complex (MTC) 
and to provide information on trans-
mission of mycobacterial diseases be-
tween animals and humans (6). How-
ever, because of limited resources and 
lack of expertise, these techniques are 
not commonly used in most develop-
ing nations such as Nigeria, where TB 
is endemic (3).
Because slaughterhouses provide 
excellent opportunities for detect-
ing diseases of economic and public 
health importance, we investigated the 
presence of mycobacteria in slaugh-
tered goats with lesions suggestive of 
TB. The investigation was conducted 
at the Bodija Municipal Abattoir in 
Ibadan in southwestern Nigeria over 
a period of 6 months. Slaughtered 
goats were obtained from local herds 
and herds in northern Nigeria. A total 
of 10,389 male and female goats of 2 
breeds (West African Dwarf and Red 
Sokoto) and 1–2 years of age were 
slaughtered; 1,387 were inspected for 
gross lesions of TB.
Of 1,387 animals screened, 62 
(4.47%) had lesions suggestive of

Streptococcus suis

with advanced TB may occur, given 
the endemic nature of TB in humans 
in Nigeria (10). TB cases caused by 
EAI strains have been found in hu-
mans in southwestern Nigeria (4; S.I. 
Cadmus et al., unpub. data), a ﬁ nding 
that supports zoonotic transmission of 
this organism from humans to goats. 
However, different lineages of M. tu-
berculosis may vary in host range, and 
EAI genotype strains may be adapted 
to human and animal hosts. Converse-
ly, human-to-animal transmission of 
M. tuberculosis has been reported in 
Nigeria relative to infection in cattle 
(3,4). Thus, conﬁ rmation of TB in 
goats supports the possibility of risk 
for TB transmission between humans 
and animals in Nigeria.
This study should be interpreted 
in the context of its limitations. Be-
cause the sources of the animals were 
unknown, we could not determine 
whether the organisms were imported 
from a neighboring country (3). In ad-
dition, we lacked information on the 
breed and condition of the animals. 
However, we have identiﬁ ed M. tu-
berculosis and TB in goats in Nigeria. 
Additional studies of other slaughter-
houses in Nigeria are needed to con-
ﬁ rm our results.

To the Editor: Streptococcus 
suis is a swine pathogen and zoonotic 
agent responsible for septicemia and 
meningitis (1). S. suis is in emergence 
in some Asian countries. Indeed, this 
pathogen has been described as the 
most and second-most common cause 
of adult meningitis in Vietnam and 
Thailand, respectively (2,3). Moreover, 
during an outbreak in People’s Repub-
lic of China in 2005, 39 of 215 patients 
died from S. suis diseases (4). On the 
other hand, only 2 human S. suis cases 
have been reported in the United States 
(5,6). Here, we describe a ﬁ rst case of 
human S. suis meningitis in Hawaii.
The patient, a 34-year-old Ton-
gan male with no medical history who 
worked as a coconut tree trimmer, 
was singing in his church choir when 
he developed an acute-onset, global 
headache and emesis. Upon hospital 
admission, he described a week of

about swine contact. He described 
slaughtering by hand several noncom-
mercially raised pigs over the preced-
ing several weeks for a church-related 
luau. The patient did not recall any 
clear incident of mucosal exposure 
to pig blood or secretions. The exact 
route of S. suis infection for humans 
is not known. However, most cases 
have been linked to accidental inocu-
lation through skin injuries (1). The 
patient did not wear gloves, masks, or 
any other protective equipment dur-
ing the prolonged process of butcher-
ing the pigs, and his exposure to pig 
blood, skin, and internal organs was 
extensive. He sustained multiple small 
cuts on his hands during butchering. 
No other church members who par-
ticipated in preparing pigs for the luau 
became ill.
The patient was treated with cef-
triaxone and a 4-day course of dex-
amathasone. His headache and menin-
gismus improved progressively, and he 
was discharged after 6 days to complete 
a 2-week course of intravenous ceftri-
axone. However, 1 day after discharge, 
the patient complained of headaches 
and mild-to-moderate bilateral hear-
ing loss. He was readmitted; a repeat 
lumbar puncture showed resolving 
CSF pleocytosis, and an MRI showed 
that his prior radiographic ﬁ ndings had 
normalized. The symptoms, attributed 
to residual meningeal/cerebral edema, 
resolved quickly after the reintroduc-
tion of steroids. Audiometric testing 
suggested mild sensorineural hearing 
loss in the right ear. The patient com-
pleted the remainder of his intravenous 
ceftriaxone course and was discharged 
on a 2-week course of amoxicillin and 
oral steroids.
He was again admitted 2 days 
after completing treatment, with dis-
abling dizziness. On exam he showed 
new torsional nystagmus, more pro-
nounced with left lateral gaze, consis-
tent with a right peripheral vestibul-
opathy. An MRI of the head was again 
normal. Oral dexamethasone promptly 
resolved his vestibulopathy, and the 
patient was discharged on a slow ste-
roid taper. After a month, dexametha-
sone was discontinued. The patient 
has been asymptomatic since, and his 
hearing loss has resolved fully.
antecedent nonspeciﬁ c symptoms for 
which he had taken nonsteroidal anti-
inﬂ ammatory drugs without relief.
On examination, he was afe-
brile, tired-appearing but alert, and 
with stable vital signs. He presented 
mild meningismus and photophobia; 
no rash was observed. Blood tests 
showed 27,600 leukocytes/μL with 
65% neutrophils; 168,000 platelets/
μL; hemoglobin 17.3 g/dL; and crea-
tinine 1.4 mg/dL. A computed tomog-
raphy scan of the head was read as 
showing substantial motion artifact 
and a possible cerebral mass. Nuclear 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
of the head showed no mass, but T2-
weighted images (postgadolinium) 
suggested both increased grey/white 
matter contrast consistent with dif-
fuse cortical edema, and vascular 
congestion/inﬂ ammation of the sulci.
Cerebrospinal ﬂ uid (CSF) ob-
tained from a lumbar puncture had 
2,770 leukocytes/μL with 94% neu-
trophils; glucose 30 mg/dL; and pro-
tein 230 mg/L. A Gram stain of the 
CSF showed numerous gram-positive 
cocci, mostly in pairs and short chains 
(Figure). Empiric intravenous therapy 
with dexamethasone, vancomycin, 
and ceftriaxone was administered for 
possible pneumococcal meningitis.
Blood cultures grew a Strepto-
coccus species, later identiﬁ ed by 
16S rRNA gene sequencing as being 
S. suis, sensitive to penicillin, vanco-
mycin, and ceftriaxone. The isolate 
was assigned to serotype 2 by the 
coagglutination test (7) and shown 
by Western blot to produce suilysin, 
extracellular protein factor and mu-
ramidase-released protein, which are 
virulence markers often associated 
with highly virulent strains of Eur-
asian, but not North American, origin 
(1,8). A strain of this phenotype was 
responsible for a previous US S. suis 
meningitis case, but the patient had 
been infected in the Philippines (5; 
unpub. data).
Upon identiﬁ cation of the S. suis 
isolate, the patient was questioned

The role of steroids in treating 
patients with S. suis infection remains 
unclear, although this case illustrates 
that the inﬂ ammation associated with 
this infection can be profound and 
can require prolonged steroid therapy. 
Since at least 2 cases of relapse have 
been reported after 2 and 4 weeks 
of treatment (1), prolonged therapy 
should be considered for infections 
caused by this pathogen. Hearing loss 
from S. suis meningitis occurs fre-
quently and can be irreversible (1). 
Hawaii’s swine industry is character-
ized by small herds and a high degree 
of concentration (9). This case of 
human S. suis meningitis in Hawaii 
emphasizes the need for these data 
to be generated and made available. 
Indeed, this bacterium is increasingly 
recognized as a signiﬁ cant zoonotic 
agent in Asia; although it remains a 
relatively rare cause of human infec-
tion elsewhere, persons in close oc-
cupational contact with pigs or pork 
products are at higher risk than others 
(1). Increasing awareness of this dis-
ease is expected to help counter hu-
man S. suis infections.

To the Editor: Chorioamnionitis 
is a common cause of maternal and 
neonatal illness and death (1), but cho-
rioamnionitis attributed to Staphylo-
coccus aureus, including methicillin-
resistant S. aureus (MRSA), is reported 
infrequently (2–5). In the context of 
the rising incidence of community-
associated MRSA (CA-MRSA) infec-
tions (6), we report an apparent case of 
CA-MRSA chorioamnionitis.
The patient, a 31-year-old woman 
with polycystic ovary syndrome and 
hypothyroidism, had 1 prior preg-
nancy but no viable offspring. After a 
clomiphene-assisted conception, rou-
tine ultrasound at 21 weeks’ gestation 
identiﬁ ed a shortened cervix (5 mm). 
The patient declined amniocentesis 
for cerclage and was treated with pel-
vic rest and vaginal progesterone. Five 
days later, she arrived at the emergency 
department with foul-smelling vaginal 
discharge. At this time, the patient was 
afebrile and hemodynamically stable, 
had no abdominal pain, and had a leu-
kocyte count of 9.5 × 103 cells/mm3.
Premature rupture of membranes 
was diagnosed, and the patient was 
admitted and administered intrave-
nous ampicillin and azithromycin. 
Nine days into treatment, at 23 weeks’ 
gestation, 210 hours after membrane 
rupture, a 415-g live-born girl was 
delivered spontaneously in footling 
breech with Apgar scores of 1 (1 min) 
and 5 (5 min). During admission, the 
mother was never febrile and did not 
complain of abdominal tenderness or 
chills. The highest leukocyte count 
was 12.4 × 103 cells/mm3. The mother 
was discharged the day after deliv-
ery without further complications. At 
6-week follow-up, she remained well, 
with no signs of infection.

ates an opportunity for this agent to 
cause ascending gestational infection. 
This ﬁ nding is meaningful because 
recommended empirical antimicro-
bial drug treatments may not cover 
CA-MRSA, increasing the likelihood 
of infectious complications (1). How-
ever, culture results when available 
can provide therapeutic guidance. 
We hope this report raises awareness 
of the possibility of CA-MRSA cho-
rioamnionitis and encourages reports 
from other authors so this entity can 
be better established, characterized, 
and monitored.

Pathologic examination of the pla-
centa demonstrated focal acute funisi-
tis, acute chorioamnionitis with fetal 
surface acute arteritis and acute deci-
duitis. Cultures from the maternal and 
fetal sides of the placenta grew pre-
dominantly MRSA and rare colonies 
of methicillin-susceptible S. aureus. 
The MRSA antimicrobial drug proﬁ le, 
including trimethoprim/sulfamethox-
azole and clindamycin susceptibility, 
was characteristic of CA-MRSA (6).
The neonate, who died on day 16, 
was culture-positive for CA-MRSA 
from blood, 2 umbilical swabs, and 
a tracheal aspirate. The antibiogram 
of these isolates was identical to the 
placental cultures, including absence 
of inducible clindamycin resistance. 
Postmortem 
examination 
showed 
hemorrhagic necrotizing pneumonia 
and gram-negative bacilli. Culture 
of lung tissue grew Escherichia coli. 
Isolates from the placenta and neonate 
were identiﬁ ed phenotypically, with-
out molecular testing.
Maternal complications of cho-
rioamnionitis include endometritis, 
bacteremia, hemorrhage, and cesarean 
delivery (1). Clinically, chorioamni-
onitis can be diagnosed by maternal 
fever (>38oC) and 2 of the following: 
maternal leukocytosis (>15 × 103cells/
mm3), maternal tachycardia (>100 
bpm), fetal tachycardia (>160 bpm), 
uterine tenderness, and foul-smelling 
amniotic ﬂ uid (1). This patient had 
none of these signs, except foul-smell-
ing amniotic ﬂ uid, and fetal tachycar-
dia was absent. In this case, chorioam-
nionitis was diagnosed by histology.
Amniotic ﬂ uid cultures from 
pregnancies complicated by chorio-
amnionitis have shown multiple or-
ganisms from the vaginal ﬂ ora, such 
as Streptococcus agalactiae, Gardner-
ella vaginalis, Mycoplasma hominis, 
Ureaplasma urealyticum, anaerobes, 
and E. coli (1). Chorioamnionitis as-
sociated with S. aureus is uncommon 
(2,3), and MRSA chorioamnionitis is 
rare (4,5). The ﬁ rst 2 reports of MRSA 
chorioamnionitis appeared in 1998 
(4) and 2002 (5). In both instances, 
the patients worked in the healthcare 
industry, and the authors considered 
the MRSA to have been nosocomial 
strains. The patient in our report was 
a restaurant manager, had no prior re-
corded hospital admissions, and was 
not previously known to be colonized 
by MRSA.
CA-MRSA strains are epide-
miologically and clonally unrelated 
to hospital-associated MRSA (HA-
MRSA) strains and can be differ-
entiated by the presence of staphy-
lococcal cassette chromosome mec 
type IV and the absence of multidrug 
resistance seen with HA-MRSA (6). 
Recently, the incidence of CA-MR-
SA infections increased in commu-
nity settings, including outbreaks in 
settings in which CA-MRSA is en-
demic, with manifestations ranging 
from skin and soft tissue infections 
to necrotizing pneumonia (6). Geni-
tal colonization with MRSA recently 
has been reported with a frequency of 
0.5%–3.5% in pregnant women (7,8). 
In 1 study, most (93%) of these iso-
lates were CA-MRSA (7).
Eckhardt et al. described a pa-
tient with chorioamnionitis in whom 
CA-MRSA bacteremia developed (9). 
However, this descriptor was used to 
specify multidrug-resistant MRSA 
not acquired in a hospital. Moreover, 
neither placental nor amniotic ﬂ uid 
cultures were described. Laibl et al. 
reported 2 patients with CA-MRSA 
infections in whom chorioamnionitis 
developed (10). Again, placental and 
amniotic ﬂ uid culture results were 
not reported, nor was chorioamni-
onitis listed as an infection caused by 
CA-MRSA in their cohort. However, 
these latter 2 patients might repre-
sent additional cases of CA-MRSA 
chorioamnionitis.
Although the incidence of CA-
MRSA infections continues to in-
crease, CA-MRSA chorioamnionitis 
appears to remain rare. Nevertheless,

nization among pregnant women cre-

Methicillin-
Resistant 
Staphylococcus 
aureus in Marine 
Mammals 
To the Editor: Methicillin-resis-
tant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) 
is emerging as an important cause of 
illness and death in animals and has 
been found in an impressive variety 
of species. However, to date, only 2 
studies have reported the isolation of 
MRSA from marine mammals, 1 seal 
(1) and 3 bottlenose dolphins (2). We 
describe an investigation that was con-
ducted after MRSA was isolated from 
a dolphin at a marine park in North 
America.
In November 2006, a 20-year-
old, male, captive, bottlenose dolphin, 
suspected of having pneumonia, was 
treated empirically with ciproﬂ oxacin 
and itraconazole. Despite treatment, 
the dolphin died in December 2006. A 
necropsy was performed, and a culture 
swab specimen of the blowhole was 
submitted for bacteriologic examina-
tion; MRSA was then isolated. The 
clinical relevance of this ﬁ nding was 
unclear. Pulsed-ﬁ eld gel electropho-
resis (PFGE) was conducted (3), and 
results indicated that the MRSA strain 
isolated was the Canadian epidemic 
MRSA (CMRSA)2 (USA100) strain, 
the predominant hospital- and com-
munity-associated MRSA strain found 
in persons in Canada (4). To determine 
the extent of MRSA colonization in 
this marine park, blowhole swab spec-
imens were collected from dolphins, 
orcas, and beluga whales, and nasal 
swab specimens were collected from 
walruses, sea lions, harbor seals, gray 
seals, and park personnel, excluding 4 
employees in January 2007. Selective 
culture for MRSA was performed, and 
strains were typed with PFGE (3) and 
spa typing (5). All MRSA strains were 
investigated for the Panton-Valentine 
leukocidin (PVL) toxin genes (6).
In January 2007, MRSA was not 
isolated from personnel (0/22), sea 
lions (0/12), harbor seals (0/2), gray 
seals (0/2), orcas (0/4), or beluga 
whales (0/23); it was isolated from dol-
phins (2/6, 33.3%) and a walrus (1/6, 
16.7%). To reduce the risk for MRSA 
transmission among the marine mam-
mals and to personnel, the following 
steps were recommended: colonized 
animals were isolated, contact with 
colonized animals was restricted, all 
park personnel were required to wear 
gloves and masks when handling 
colonized animals, and routine hand 
hygiene was emphasized. Colonized 
walruses were isolated in a separate 
facility until May 2007. Because of 
space limitations, colonized dolphins 
could not be isolated. Although the 
park instituted a strict policy that re-
quired personnel to wear gloves and 
masks, this policy ceased during the 
summer months due to the park’s ex-
hibition schedule.
Because we knew from our ob-
servations of other animal species that 
natural decolonization with MRSA is 
common, as well as lacking informa-
tion about antimicrobial drug efﬁ cacy 
for MRSA decolonization in marine 
mammals, and had concerns regarding 
the emergence of further antimicrobial 
drug resistance, we recommended that 
no attempt be made to decolonize the 
animals with antimicrobial agents. Af-
ter these recommendations were made 
and implemented, follow-up testing 
for MRSA colonization was performed 
on the dolphins and walruses through-
out 2007 and 2008 (Table). In Octo-
ber 2007, testing conducted on all sea 
lions, harbor seals, gray seals, orcas,

Parachlamydia and 
Rhabdochlamydia 
in Premature 
Neonates
DOI: 10.3201/eid1512.090220
References
To the Editor: New members 
have recently been recognized in the 
order Chlamydiales (1). The family 
Rhabdochlamydiaceae includes R. por-
cellionis (a parasite of Porcellio scab-
er) and R. crassiﬁ cans (a pathogen of 
the cockroach Blatta orientalis) (2,3); 
their pathogenic role in humans has not 
yet been investigated. Parachlamydia 
acanthamoebae and Protochlamydia 
naegleriophila belong to the family 
Parachlamydiaceae (1,4). Increasing 
evidence indicates that these obligate 
intracellular bacteria infecting free-
living amebae may cause respiratory 
diseases in humans (1). Recent ﬁ ndings 
also suggest a role for Parachlamydia 
in miscarriage, stillbirth, and preterm 
labor (5–7). Whether these bacteria 
may contaminate the newborns of in-
fected mothers is unknown.
The aims of this study were to 
1) develop a real-time PCR for de-
tecting Rhabdochlamydia spp. and 2) 
and beluga whales showed that none 
of these animals were colonized with 
MRSA. Overall, MRSA was isolated 
on >1 occasions from 5 dolphins (n = 
6, 83.3%) and 3 walruses (n = 6, 50%) 
(Table). All strains were indistinguish-
able on PFGE and were consistent 
with the CMRSA2 (USA100) strain. 
They were also spa type t002 and did 
not possess the PVL toxin genes.
This report of MRSA shows 
colonization in several dolphins and 
walruses, with apparent transmis-
sion between species. The direction 
of transmission cannot be determined 
because of the sampling method; how-
ever, a human origin is suspected be-
cause the clone that was isolated is a 
predominant human clone. The failure 
to identify a concurrently colonized 
person does not preclude a human 
source. Since the time MRSA was in-
troduced into the facility is unknown, 
the source of infection may have been 
decolonized by the time of sampling 
or was not sampled. Furthermore, 
park visitors occasionally have con-
tact with these animals so the origin 
could have been from the general pub-
lic. Whether colonization of multiple 
animals was due to repeated instances 
of human-to-animal transmission or 
whether animal-to-animal transmis-
sion may have occurred is not clear. 
For the dolphins, the second scenario 
is most likely, considering the social 
nature of these animals and the in-
ability to isolate colonized dolphins. 
These factors may have resulted in the 
circulation of MRSA among these ani-
mals. Although no water samples were 
obtained for testing, waterborne trans-
mission cannot be dismissed.
Colonization 
was 
eliminated 
without antimicrobial agents; how-
ever, long-term (15 months) MRSA 
colonization was found in 1 dolphin. 
With patience and continued use of 
infection control measures, MRSA 
was apparently eradicated from this 
facility without the need for active 
decolonization. This study shows the

apply this PCR, and those previously 
described for Parachlamydia and Pro-
tochlamydia (4,8), to respiratory sam-

parts of the 16S rRNA encoding gene, 
to speciﬁ cally amplify Rhabdochla-
mydia spp. The 5′-FAM probe (Euro-
gentec, Seraing, Belgium) contained 
locked nucleic acids (underlined) to

ibility were excellent (online Technical 
Appendix).
This PCR and those previously 
described for Parachlamydia and Pro-
tochlamydia (4,8) were retrospectively 
applied to 39 respiratory samples from 
29 neonates admitted in the neonatol-
ogy unit of our institution (median 1 
sample per patient, range 1–4 sample). 
All but 1 patient had a gestational 
age at birth <36 weeks (median 28.6,

improve speciﬁ city. Reactions were 
performed with 0.2 μM of each primer, 
0.1 μM of probe, and iTaq Supermix 
(Bio-Rad, Rheinach, Switzerland). 
PCR products were detected with ABI 
Prism 7000 (Applied Biosystems, 
Rotkreuz, Switzerland). Inhibition, 
negative PCR mixture, and extraction 
controls were systematically tested.
To enable quantiﬁ cation, a plasmid 
containing the target gene was con-
structed as described (4,9). The analyti-
cal sensitivity of the real-time PCR for 
Rhabdochlamydia spp. was <10 copies 
DNA/μL. No cross-ampliﬁ cation was 
observed when the analytical speciﬁ city 
was tested with human, amebal (Acan-

Parachlamydia in women experienc-
ing miscarriage (5,6), and DNA of this 
bacterium has been detected in the am-
niotic ﬂ uid of a woman with premature 
delivery (7). Whether neonatal infec-
tion results from a systemic infection 
during pregnancy or an inoculation at 
delivery is unknown. Because of the 
retrospective design of the study, no 
samples from the mothers were avail-
able for additional molecular or sero-
logic analyses. Hospital water supplies 
are an important reservoir of free-liv-
ing amebae and may represent another 
mode of acquisition because patients 
undergoing mechanical ventilation are 
exposed to aerosolized particles (10). 
Simultaneous detection of Parachla-
mydia and Rhabdochlamydia in 2 pa-
tients with initial negative results and 
their simultaneous detection in 1 neo-
nate supports the latter hypothesis.
In conclusion, Parachlamydia 
and Rhabdochlamydia DNA were 
detected in respiratory secretions of 
premature newborns with more severe 
conditions at birth, more mechanical 
ventilation requirements, and a trend 
toward a higher mortality rate. The 
pathogenic role of these Chlamydia-
related bacteria in neonates deserves 
further investigations.

distress syndrome was present in 25 
(86%) of these 29 neonates. Samples 
had been drawn a median of 14 days 
(range 1–229 days) after birth, when 
clinically indicated. Results of PCR for 
Parachlamydia, Protochlamydia, and 
Rhabdochlamydia were positive for 9 
(31%), 0 (0%), and 4 (14%) neonates, 
respectively. Positive results were ob-
tained on the ﬁ rst sample drawn after 
birth for all but 2 neonates (initial nega-
tive results). One patient had positive 
PCR results for Parachlamydia and 
Rhabdochlamydia. These 12 newborns 
with positive PCR results for Parachla-
mydia and/or Rhabdochlamydia were 
compared with the 17 who had nega-
tive PCR results (Table).
Newborns with a Chlamydia-relat-
ed organism documented in the respira-
tory tract had a signiﬁ cantly worse pri-
mary adaptation score (Apgar). These 
patients experienced more resuscitation 
maneuvers at birth. Durations of inva-
sive mechanical ventilation and hospi-
tal stay were also longer among them. 
Three newborns died, compared with 
no deaths among the 17 with negative 
PCR results (p = 0.06). Pneumonia 
was documented in 5 of the 12 patients 
with positive Parachlamydia and/or 
Rhabdochlamydia PCR results but was 
concomitant to PCR positivity for only 
3 of them. An alternative etiology was 
documented in all 3 (online Technical 
Appendix).
Parachlamydia and Rhabdochla-
mydia have thus been detected in a 
population of premature neonates. Most 
of these patients had severe respiratory 
distress syndrome, and the role of these 
bacteria as a causal agent of pneumonia 
could not be clearly assessed. The lon-
ger duration of mechanical ventilation 
for newborns with positive PCR results 
may suggest an occult superinfection 
with a Chlamydia-related bacterium 
contributing to the severity of the initial 
respiratory disease.
Our results also raise a ques-
tion about the mode of acquisition of 
these microorganisms. A recent study 
reported a higher seroprevalence of

Porcine Kobuvirus 
in Piglets, Thailand 
of the genus Kobuvirus, and named 
porcine kobuvirus (7,9).
Currently, 2 reports have de-
scribed the epidemiologic feature of 
porcine kobuvirus in healthy piglets. 
Thirty-nine (65%) of 60 stool samples 
collected from pigs in Hungary were 
positive for porcine kobuvirus by re-
verse transcription–PCR (RT-PCR) 
(9). Another report from China found 
that the prevalence of porcine kobuvi-
rus was 30% (97 of 322 piglets) (8). 
These ﬁ ndings suggested that porcine 
kobuvirus infections are common in 
piglets. However, whether this agent 
is associated with particular diseases, 
including gastroenteritis, in piglets 
was not clear.
We conducted an epidemiologic 
survey of porcine kobuvirus and report 
the detection of this virus in the stool 
specimens of piglets with diarrhea. 
Sequence and phylogenetic analyses 
of the porcine kobuvirus strains were 
carried out to determine their evolu-
tionary relationships with kobuvirus 
strains previously reported.
A total of 98 stool specimens were 
collected from piglets with diarrhea 
from 6 farms in Chiang Mai Province, 
Thailand, during 2001–2003. Age of 
the piglets ranged from 7 to 49 days 
old. Porcine kobuvirus was detected 
in fecal specimens by RT-PCR (9). 
The representative strains of porcine 
kobuvirus detected in our study were 
analyzed further by direct sequenc-
ing of their PCR amplicons (216 bp) 
by using BigDye Terminator Cycle 
Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, 
Foster City, CA, USA). Sequences of 
these fragments were compared with 
those of reference strains available in 
the NCBI GenBank database by using 
BLAST server (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.
nih.gov/Blast.cgi). Phylogenetic and 
molecular evolutionary analyses were 
conducted by using MEGA 4 (10). 
Nucleotide sequences of porcine ko-
buvirus strains described in this study 
were deposited in GenBank under ac-
cession nos. GQ152093–GQ152122.
To the Editor: To date, the ge-
nus Kobuvirus has consisted of 2 of-
ﬁ cially recognized species, Aichi virus 
and Bovine Kobuvirus (1). Aichi virus 
has been shown to be associated with 
acute gastroenteritis in humans (2–4), 
and bovine kobuvirus has been detect-
ed only in cattle (5,6). Most recently, 
a third candidate species of Kobuvirus 
has been described in pigs by 2 dif-
ferent groups of investigators from 
Hungary and the People’s Republic of 
China (7,8). This new candidate spe-
cies was serendipitously recognized in 
stool specimens from pigs when PCR 
products (≈1,100 bp) were ampliﬁ ed 
by using a primer pair for the detec-
tion of caliciviruses (7).
Nucleotide sequences of these 
nonspeciﬁ c PCR products were simi-
lar to those of the U-1 bovine kobuvi-
rus and Aichi virus A846/88 reference 
strains; sequence identities ranged 
from 73% to 79% at the nucleotide 
level and from 69% to 70% at the 
amino acid (7). The representative 
strain of a new candidate species of 
porcine kobuvirus, S-1-HUN (Por-
cine kobuvirus/swine/S-1-HUN/2007/
Hungary), has been analyzed to deter-
mine its complete genome sequence 
and genetic organization (9). The 
RNA genome of the S-1-HUN strain 
comprises 8,210 nt, with a genome 
organization analogous to that of pi-
cornaviruses. Therefore, this strain is 
tentatively classiﬁ ed as a new species 
Prevalence of porcine kobuvirus 
was exceptionally high in piglets with 
diarrhea, 99% (97 of 98 specimens). 
Thirty representative strains of por-
cine kobuvirus detected in this study 
were randomly selected, sequenced, 
and analyzed to determine their evolu-
tionary relationships with other kobu-
virus reference strains. The partial 3D 
region among all 30 porcine kobuvi-
rus strains was highly conserved, with 
nucleotide sequence identities >90%. 
In addition, our strains were most 
closely related to 2 porcine kobuvi-
rus reference strains (S-1-HUN and 
Swine/2007/CHN) available in Gen-
Bank, with the nucleotide sequence 
identity ranging from 91.5% to 96.3%. 
Phylogenetic analysis of partial 3D 
nucleotide sequences of our porcine 
kobuvirus strains, together with pub-
lished sequences of porcine kobuvirus 
reference strains (and those of Aichi 
virus and bovine kobuvirus), is shown 
in the Figure. The phylogenetic tree 
conﬁ rmed that all strains we identi-
ﬁ ed belonged to the porcine kobuvi-
rus species and formed a tight cluster 
in a monophyletic branch with the 
other 2 porcine kobuvirus reference 
strains (S-1-HUN and Swine/2007/
CHN). These strains are also distantly 
related to standard strains of Aichi vi-
rus and bovine kobuvirus. Recently, 
18 sequences of partial 3D region of 
the porcine kobuvirus strains detect-
ed in China have been deposited in 
GenBank. Unfortunately, the speciﬁ c 
position of PCR ampliﬁ cation of the 
strains found in China was different 
from that of our strains (8). Therefore, 
the relationship between these strains 
could not be analyzed.
Porcine kobuviruses have previ-
ously been reported only in healthy 
pigs (7–9). In our study, the excep-
tionally high prevalence of porcine 
kobuviruses (99%) has been observed 
in piglets with acute gastroenteritis; 
those samples were negative for rotavi-
rus infection as determined previously 
by RT-PCR. However, associations of 
this agent with enteric diseases in pigs

remains unclear because no data were 
available that tested for porcine kobu-
virus in pigs without gastroenteritis 
from the farms in the same area. In ad-
dition, infection with other pathogens 
that may cause diarrhea in pigs, such as 
bacteria or other porcine caliciviruses, 
needs to be ruled out. Further extensive 
epidemiologic surveillance and com-
prehensive characterization of porcine

help clarify the distribution, heteroge-

Rickettsia slovaca 
in Dermacentor 
marginatus ticks, 
Germany 
Palatinate. The patient reported a tick 
bite; the tick was identiﬁ ed as Der-
macentor spp. Fever, lymphadenopa-
thy of submandibular lymph nodes, 
and exanthema at the site of the tick 
bite developed 7 days later. Serologic 
examinations by using an immuno-
ﬂ uorescent test (Focus Diagnostics, 
Cypress, CA, USA) showed antibody 
titers of 64 for immunoglobulin (Ig) 
M and 1,024 for IgG against rickett-
siae of the spotted fever group. These 
results indicated an acute rickettsial 
infection. Because of strong cross-
reactivity among all species in the 
spotted fever group, we cannot dif-
ferentiate between antibodies against 
R. slovaca and other species in this 
group.
However, another immunoﬂ uo-
rescent test for typhus group rick-
ettsiae showed negative results, con-
ﬁ rming that the patient was infected 
with spotted fever group rickettsiae. 
Results of PCRs speciﬁ c for gltA 
and rOmpA of the patient’s tick were 
positive. We identiﬁ ed R. slovaca by 
sequencing the rOmpA gene. The se-
quence obtained showed 100% simi-
larity with sequences in ticks from 
Aschaffenburg. Clinical symptoms, 
serologic results, and detection of R. 
slovaca in the tick from the patient 
strongly indicate that the patient had 
tick-borne lymphadenopathy caused 
by R. slovaca.
The high prevalence of R. raoultii 
in Dermacentor spp. ticks is of con-
cern because this species can also 
cause tick-borne lymphadenopathy, 
although R. raoultii is less pathogenic 
than R. slovaca (8). Tick-borne lymph-
adenopathy should be considered in 
the differential diagnosis of tick-borne 
diseases. The extent of the distribution 
of R. slovaca and R. raoultii in Ger-
many remains to be elucidated.
This study was supported by the 
Landesstiftung 
Baden-Wuerttemberg, 
Germany, and the Grimminger Stiftung für 
Anthropozoonosenforschung, Germany.
To the Editor: Dermacentor spp. 
ticks are found in many countries in 
Europe, and are vectors for several 
pathogens, including Francisella tu-
larensis, Coxiella burnetii, Rickettsia 
spp., and Babesia canis (1,2). Be-
cause Dermacentor marginatus ticks 
require warm dry habitats, these ticks 
are found in only a few areas in south-
ern Germany, mainly in the Rhine and 
Main valleys (3). However, these ticks 
may spread northwards because of in-
creasing temperatures. In contrast, D. 
reticulatus ticks are present through-
out Germany.
Fourteen Rickettsia spp. are cur-
rently identiﬁ ed as human pathogens. 
The severity of human diseases differs 
among these species, ranging from 
mild to lethal illness (4). On the basis 
of serologic and genotypical charac-
teristics, rickettsiae are divided into ty-
phus and spotted fever groups. Within 
each group, antigenic differences are 
small, resulting in cross-reactivity that 
complicates differentiation of Rickett-
sia spp. by serologic methods. There-
fore, PCR of eschar biopsy samples is 
a useful tool for diagnosis of rickett-
sial diseases (5).
Little information exists regard-
ing the prevalence of Rickettsia spp. 
in D. marginatus and D. reticulatus 
ticks in Germany. R. raoultii was re-
cently detected in 23% of D. reticula-
tus ticks (6). In 1977, Rehacek et al. 
identiﬁ ed R. slovaca in 12% of Der-
macentor spp. ticks from southern 
Baden-Wuerttemberg (7). Since then, 
this pathogen has not been detected in 
Germany. R. slovaca, a member of the 
spotted fever group, causes tick-borne 
lymphadenopathy, a relatively mild 
rickettsiosis (8). We report detection 
of R. slovaca in 5 of 666 Dermacen-
tor spp. ticks from southern Germany. 
Moreover, we identiﬁ ed a case of 
tick-borne lymphadenopathy from 
Rhineland-Palatinate.
We collected 666 adult Derma-
centor spp. ticks by blanket-dragging; 
26 were collected along the Main Riv-
er near Aschaffenburg (Bavaria), and 
640 from the Rhine Valley near Lör-
rach (Baden-Wuerttemberg). Ticks 
were homogenized, and the DNA 
was isolated by using the Maxwell 
16 Instrument (Promega, Madison, 
WI, USA). For detection of rickett-
siae, a TaqMan real-time PCR with 
the LightCycler system (Roche Di-
agnostics, Mannheim, Germany) was 
performed according to Wölfel et al. 
(9). A primer pair ampliﬁ ed a 70-bp 
fragment of the citrate synthase (gltA) 
gene. All positive samples were also 
tested with a PCR speciﬁ c for the out-
er membrane protein A (rOmpA) gene 
(10). This ampliﬁ cation yielded an 
rOmpA fragment of 532 bp. Ampliﬁ ed 
products were analyzed by agarose gel 
electrophoresis.
For identiﬁ cation of Rickettsia 
spp., ampliﬁ cation products of the 
rOmpA PCR were sequenced by using 
ﬂ uorescence-labeled 
dideoxynucle-
otide technology (Applied Biosys-
tems, Darmstadt, Germany). Separa-
tion of sequenced fragments and data 
collection were performed by using 
an ABI PRISM 310 Genetic Analyzer 
(Applied Biosystems). All obtained se-
quences were analyzed and compared 
by using BLAST (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov/BLAST).
Rickettsia spp. was detected by 
both PCR methods in 31% of 666 
Dermacentor spp. ticks examined. Se-
quencing of part of the rOmpA gene 
showed that sequences of 5 samples 
(0.75%) from Aschaffenburg were 
R. slovaca, showing 100% similarity 
with a sequence deposited in GenBank 
(accession no. U43808). Only D. mar-
ginatus ticks from Aschaffenburg 
were infected with R. slovaca, and 202 
ticks from Lörrach were infected with 
R. raoultii.
We also identiﬁ ed a case of R. slo-
vaca infection in southern Rhineland-

In Filoviruses: A Compendium of 
40 Years of Epidemiological, Clinical, 
and Laboratory Studies, Jens Kuhn 
presents a complete review of every 
paper published on the subject, as well 
as hundreds of unpublished reports. In 
addition, most of the world’s known 
experts on ﬁ loviruses contributed per-
sonal data and anecdotes. A CD-ROM 
with a searchable list of all quoted ref-
erences (≈4,500) is a useful addition 
to the book.
The author details the history of 
all Marburg and Ebola outbreaks dur-
ing the 40 years from the discovery of 
Marburg in 1967 to the latest Marburg 
outbreak in 2007 in Uganda, includ-
ing difﬁ cult-to-ﬁ nd information. The 
clinical and pathologic presentations 
of Ebola and Marburg diseases in 
human and animal models contain a 
substantial number of black and white 
and color illustrations. With the range 
of the Ebola and Marburg viruses still 
unknown and the search for the animal 
reservoirs ongoing, antibody serosur-
veys in humans and animals have been 
conducted in most countries in Africa 
and in the Philippines after the Ebola 
Reston outbreaks; Kuhn dedicates a 
long chapter to this subject. All animal 
species tested are presented in tables 
but, more interestingly, also indexed at 
the end of the book. This information 
is particularly valuable for ecologists 
and epidemiologists searching for the 
reservoir of ﬁ loviruses.
Kuhn explains the structure and 
replication of the ﬁ loviruses, with the 
actual role of each gene of the virus 
from entry into the target cells to pro-
duction of infectious virus. He lists di-
agnosis techniques and experimental 
treatments of the Marburg and Ebola 
diseases, from the traditional healers 
to the molecular antisenses RNA ap-

ANOTHER DIMENSION
A Groundhog, a Novel Bartonella 
Sequence, and My Father’s Death
Edward B. Breitschwerdt, Ricardo G. Maggi, Maria Belen Cadenas, 
and Pedro Paulo Vissotto de Paiva Diniz
D
uring the summer of 2007, migratory joint pain de-
veloped in my (E.B.B.) 86-year-old father, previously 
an ironworker, farmer, and World War II veteran. Because 
of occasional tick attachments, a Borrelia burgdorferi 
ELISA was performed; antibodies were not detected, and 
no treatment was instituted. In the fall, subtle memory loss 
developed, and he fell twice a few weeks apart. Dad jok-
ingly blamed the falls and the memory loss on “old timer’s 
disease.” Subsequently, episodes of subtle confusion and 
more frequent memory loss generated family concern as 
to what the future might hold. On December 15, he broke 
his left femur during a fall while climbing 2 stairs to enter 
our home. Despite having successfully climbed those stairs 
thousands of times in the past, he would never climb those 
or any other stairs again.
Retrospectively obvious, a pattern of insidious ill-
ness characterized by joint pain, memory loss, and inco-
ordination, not recognizable by my father or other family 
members, had begun before that summer. Medically stable 
historical problems included coronary artery disease, ath-
erosclerosis, carotid artery occlusion, hypertension, and 
atrial ﬁ brillation. During the previous year, a normocytic, 
normochromic, nonregenerative anemia persisted. Despite 
normal serum iron, total iron binding capacity, ferritin, and 
vitamin B12 values, anemia was attributed to intestinal 
blood loss. When examined in May 2007, before anesthe-
sia for endoscopy, mood and affect were appropriate, recent 
and remote memory were intact, insight and judgment were 
good. A hiatal hernia, mild antral gastritis, and duodenitis 
were visualized.

Initial Hospitalization
When my father was hospitalized December 15, 2007, 
with a broken femur, a resting pill roll tremor and cogwheel 
rigidity were suggestive of Parkinson disease. Preoperative 
neurologic consultation identiﬁ ed severe confusion, inatten-
tion, and an inability to answer questions. Short-term mem-
ory and problem-solving abilities were decreased. There 
was mild ptosis of the right eye, normal cranial nerves, 
mild asterixis, and hand weakness. Laboratory abnormali-
ties included anemia, hypercreatinemia, an elevated aspar-
tate aminotransferase level, and hyperglobulinemia. Due to 
the severity of the femoral fracture, the femoral head was 
excised and replaced with a bipolar femoral prosthesis.
Postoperatively, poor mentation was considered a se-
quela of general anesthesia and peri-operative analgesics. 
For more than a week, dementia persisted. He did not rec-
ognize family members and had near constant hallucino-
genic activities, including agitation, tying knots, sawing 
motions, and constantly pulling covers, bed clothes, and 
ﬂ uid lines. Severe hematuria developed after he pulled an 
inﬂ ated Foley catheter from his urethra. Concurrent gas-
trointestinal bleeding of undetermined cause necessitated 
multiple blood transfusions. Other complications included 
difﬁ culty swallowing and paralytic ileus. Repeat abdomi-
nal radiographs, in conjunction with stool softeners and 
laxatives, failed to alleviate gastrointestinal complications. 
Eventually, he refused food and became severely bloated. 
Endoscopy performed on December 26 identiﬁ ed severe 
necrotizing esophagitis, multiple plaques, and a stricture 
attributed to Candida albicans and herpes zoster. C. albi-
cans esophagitis is known to accompany HIV infection, 
leukemia, or an unidentiﬁ ed source of immune suppres-
sion (1,2). Shingles, caused by herpes zoster, occurred dur-
ing the previous Thanksgiving and can be associated with

proved after starting treatment with ﬂ uconazole, acyclo-
vir, and symptomatic medications for erosive esophagitis. 
However, confusion, lack of orientation, hyponatremia, hy-
pokalemia, and hyperglycemia remained problematic until 
discharge to a physical therapy center on December 31.
Translational Research and the 
Practice of Medicine
Because I direct the Intracellular Pathogens Research 
Laboratory (IPRL) at the North Carolina State Univer-
sity College of Veterinary Medicine, aseptically obtained 
blood and CSF samples were kindly provided for testing. 
Results of PCR (5,6) speciﬁ c for Anaplasma, Ehrlichia, 
and Rickettsia species were negative. Bartonella 16S–23S 
intergenic spacer primers (7) repeatedly generated ampli-
cons of different sizes from blood and CSF, respectively. 
Compared with GenBank sequences, the blood amplicon 
was most similar (434/465bp) to Candidatus Bartonella 
volans (strain FSq-1, EU294521) isolated from a south-
ern ﬂ ying squirrel (Glaucomys volans) and Candidatus 
Bartonella durdenii (391/422bp) ampliﬁ ed from Orcho-
peas howardi (GenBank accession no. DQ 336386), a ﬂ ea 
found on eastern US gray squirrels (Scinrus carolinensis), 
and a Bartonella sp. (446/492bp, EF125214) identiﬁ ed in 
ground squirrels (Spermophilus danricus) in the People’s 
Republic of China. The novel rodent Bartonella sequence 
obtained from my father’s blood had an 18-bp insert at 
positions 2047 or 334 in EU294521 and DQ336386, re-
spectively. Previously, our laboratory had never worked 
with rodent Bartonella species and had never ampliﬁ ed a 
300-bp internal transcribed spacer region amplicon from 
>3,000 animal or human blood samples. After several un-
successful cloning attempts, the CSF amplicon was most 
similar (393/394 bp) to B. henselae (NC-005956). Blood 
and CSF, cultured by using Bartonella α Proteobacte-
ria growth medium (BAPGM) (8), did not result in the 
growth of a Bartonella species.
Second Hospitalization
During the next week, strength and mental capacities 
improved rapidly and discharge to the home environment 
was scheduled for January 9. On that morning and while 
driving to Maryland to build entry ramps, I was informed 
by cell phone that my father fell out of a chair and became 
nonverbal and that a stroke was suspected. For me, the 
roller coaster illness ultimately leading to his death would 
take an unbelievable turn of events. Upon his transfer to 
the neurology service, encephalopathy, asterixis, Parkinso-
nian-type tremor, hypoactive reﬂ exes, pinpoint and mini-
mally reactive pupils, and cogwheel rigidity were found. 
Verbal communication was absent, but he would grimace 
with pain whenever extremities were manipulated. An ur-
gent computed tomography scan did not identify intracra-
nial abnormalities.
When I was a boy, my father used the expression 
“something is ﬁ shy in Denmark” to imply that something 
was astray. Based upon historical events, I suspected some-
thing was being missed. Laboratory ﬁ ndings included 
anemia (hemocrit 34%), a normal leukogram (leukocytes 
9,100 cells/μL, 2% band neutrophils), mild hypokalemia, 
hypoalbuminemia, hyperglycemia, increased serum alka-
line phosphatase level, erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 
79, and hypergammaglobulinemia. Thoracic radiographs 
identiﬁ ed mild bilateral pleural effusion. Because an un-
deﬁ ned infectious source of immunosuppression seemed 
plausible, and fever (maximum temperature 38.6°C) oc-
curred 24 hours after neurologic decompensation an in-
fectious etiology was pursued. Nasal methicillin-resistant 
Staphylococcus aureus, blood, urine, and cerebrospinal 
ﬂ uid (CSF) cultures were negative. CSF results, including 
those for special stains, were unremarkable. Serologic re-
sults for Treponema pallidum, Borrelia burgdorferi, Rick-
ettsia rickettsii, Bartonella henselae, Bartonella quintana, 
and HIV were negative. Results of CSF herpes simplex 
PCR and a test for T. pallidum antibodies were negative. 
On January 11, results of magnetic resonance imaging 
and magnetic resonance angiography were interpreted as a 
left posterior stroke with no active bleeding. Initial treat-
ment included intravenous acyclovir, ﬂ uconazole, vanco-
mycin, ceftriaxone, ampicillin, and dexamethasone.
Clinicians and Scientists Working Together
After Bartonella PCR results became available, treat-
ment with piperacillin and tazobactam were continued for 
3 weeks, until discharge. Levetiracetam was added to the 
patient’s treatment because a generalized seizure occurred 
shortly after antimicrobial drugs were given. On January 
18, severe dependent edema of the right elbow resulted 
in ﬂ uid leakage through intact skin. For 3 weeks, Dad re-
mained semicomatose, disoriented, agitated, and enceph-
alopathic. Hallucinations continued, accompanied by fre-
quent involuntary motor movements. Diabetes mellitus and 
a large decubital ulcer on the right heel developed. During 
the fourth week, mentation improved, and he could rise and 
stand for brief periods. On January 28, he was discharged 
to a rehabilitation facility, with instructions to receive 
doxycycline and rifampin 2×/d for 13 days. Blood samples, 
obtained aseptically before discharge, were again submit-
ted to the IPRL. After BAPGM pre-enrichment and subcul-
ture, B. vinsonii subsp. berkhofﬁ i genotype II was isolated, 
and sequential serologic testing identiﬁ ed a rising titer to

B. vinsonii subsp. berkhofﬁ i but did not detect B. henselae 
antibodies (Table). After a brief, emotionally traumatic stay 
at the rehabilitation facility, Dad returned home to be cared 
for by 4 sons, his wife of 60 years, and other family mem-
bers. Each week a different son slept by his bed, which was 
relocated to the family living room.
Lorazepam was administered to control the agitation 
and restlessness. The warfarin dose was increased and 
heparinization initiated for a potential cerebrovascular 
accident. Due to the prior documentation of Bartonella 
infection, intravenous doxycycline, rifampin, and gen-
tamicin were administered, and total parenteral nutrition 
was instituted. Again, shortly after initiation of antimi-
crobial drugs, a seizure occurred. Bartonella spp. were 
not ampliﬁ ed or isolated from a 1-mL blood sample ob-
tained 4 days after initiation of treatment with antimicro-
bial drugs. During the next 3 weeks, while intravenous 
antimicrobial drugs were administered, our father again 
remained encephalopathic, with frequent hallucinations, 
severe agitation, and near-constant mental confusion. On 
March 14, intravenous methylprednisolone for potential 
immune-mediated vasculitis elicited no improvement in 
mental status. Similar to the previous treatment course, 
improvement in mental status, coherent communication, 
and renewed ability to recognize family members oc-
curred during the fourth hospitalization week.
Home Again at Last
During the next 3 weeks, there was substantial and pro-
gressive improvement in physical capabilities and a return 
of normal mental capabilities, including exceptional short- 
and long-term memory. Appetite normalized, and despite 
severe atrophy, muscle strength increased so he could stand, 
walk with assistance, and, although a daily struggle, access 
the bathroom. A February 10 blood sample obtained while 
he was receiving oral antimicrobial drugs was Bartonella 
PCR negative, and no bacteria were isolated in BAPGM. 
During this precious 3 weeks, our father joked, laughed, 
and vividly recalled wartime friends and other experiences. 
On March 1, 2008, he opened Christmas presents with our 
family. I should have been there.
A Battle Lost
On April 4, Dad was discharged to our home and oral 
antimicrobial drugs (doxycycline and rifampin) were dis-
pensed. Despite all efforts by medical professionals, mem-
bers of our family, and our tough 86-year-old father, pro-
tracted illness and prolonged hospitalizations had resulted 
in mental and physical debilitation, severe muscle wasting, 
and profound weakness. More important, he had lost his 
desire to live. After discharge, there was minimal neuro-
logic improvement. Before the  availability of April 4 IPRL 
test results, he began to refuse all medications. The identi-
cal rodent Bartonella DNA sequence was again ampliﬁ ed 
from his blood, but no bacteria were isolated. 
Four weeks later my father died, on Friday, May 2, 
at 5 PM, around quitting time for an old iron worker. My 
mother and youngest brother were at his side. After his 
Third and Final Hospitalization
On March 4, ≈2 weeks after the course of oral antibi-
otics was completed, agitation and disorientation returned, 
and mental status deteriorated. Within 24 hours, Dad was 
hospitalized, where ﬁ ne motor tremors of the right hand 
and wrist, asymmetric edema involving the right leg, and 
edema of the penis and scrotum were noted. He was afebrile 
and nonverbal and could not follow simple commands. He-
matocrit was 30.2%, platelet count 557,000 cells/μL, and 
leukocyte count 7,800 cells/μL with a normal differential 
count. Serum biochemical abnormalities included hyper-
glycemia (glucose 218 mg/dL), hyperglobulinemia (3.6 
g/dL), and increased alkaline phosphatase activity (169 
IU/L). Urinalysis abnormalities included proteinuria with 
occasional hyaline casts.

death, blood culture results from another sample obtained 
by the hospice nurse on April 28, 2008, became available. 
B. vinsonii subsp. berkhofﬁ i genotype II was ampliﬁ ed and 
sequenced from the enrichment BAPGM blood culture. As 
direct extraction of DNA from blood was negative, growth 
of viable bacteria in liquid culture was implicated (8,9).
cultures were optimally obtained and sequentially tested to 
conﬁ rm therapeutic elimination. 
Elimination of Bartonella spp. by antimicrobial drugs 
in immunocompetent patients may be more difﬁ cult to 
achieve than is currently appreciated (16). Although co-
infection with B. henselae and B. vinsonii subsp. berk-
hofﬁ i has been previously reported, DNA of 3 Bartonella 
spp. was detected in our father. Based on repeatable PCR 
testing, a small quantity of B. henselae DNA was in the 
January CSF sample. Because PCR amplicon contamina-
tion was never detected in any negative control, laboratory 
error is considered unlikely. Although the BAPGM enrich-
ment approach has improved molecular detection and iso-
lation of some Bartonella spp. from human patient samples 
(9,16–18), a rodent Bartonella sp. isolate was not obtained. 
Unfortunately, 8 weeks can be required from inoculation of 
BAPGM until a subculture agar plate isolate is character-
ized by DNA sequencing. Therefore, IPRL test results were 
often not available to Dad’s physicians in a timely manner.
Age, Bartonella spp., and Immune Suppression?
Suspicion of an undetermined source of immune sup-
pression and recent tick exposures were primary factors 
motivating testing in the IPRL. Previously, B. vinsonii 
subsp. berkhofﬁ i was shown to induce immunosuppression 
in experimentally infected dogs (19,20). In retrospect, oc-
cult infection with Bartonella spp. may have contributed 
to shingles at Thanksgiving and necrotizing C. albicans 
esophagitis after hospitalization for the fractured femur. 
Recently, B. quintana lipopolysaccharide was found to have 
antiinﬂ ammatory properties (21). Immune suppressive fac-
tors may facilitate persistent intravascular Bartonella in-
fection without inducing obvious infection indicators, such 
as fever, tachycardia, leukocytosis, and CSF pleocytosis. 
Fever was documented once and mild neutrophilia for 3 
of 48 blood counts. Thrombocytosis, previously associated 
with B. henselae (22), was documented 14 times.
Groundhogs, Fleas, and the Genus Bartonella
Following our father’s death, I recalled a small, 0.5-cm, 
raised, ﬁ rm lesion within his right eyebrow that developed 
during the summer of 2007 and would spontaneously hurt 
or burn, causing him to rub or squeeze the lesion. The mass 
disappeared after he began taking antimicrobial drugs in 
2008. Retrospectively, I suspected a rodent ﬂ ea bite above 
the eye had transmitted a novel Bartonella species, which 
we sequenced from his blood after each hospitalization. 
All known Bartonella spp. have preferential animal reser-
voir hosts, and each uses arthropods or animal bites and 
scratches as the primary modes of transmission (10–12). 
Dad would occasionally capture mice, rats, skunks, and 
groundhogs in the barns. Groundhogs were transported in 
the car trunk to a distant location for release, potentially 
leaving behind ﬂ eas. Therefore, 3 Candidatus Bartonella 
spp. isolates were provided by Dr. William Nicholson, a 
colleague at the Centers for Disease Control and Preven-
tion in Atlanta. After sequencing, the 16S–23S intergenic 
spacer region of a ground squirrel (Candidatus Bartonella 
durdenii), a ﬂ ying squirrel (Candidatus Bartonella volans), 
and a groundhog (Candidatus Bartonella monaxi) isolate, 
the most similar GenBank sequence was Candidatus Bar-
tonella volans. There was no perfect match with these 3 iso-
lates. However, sequences from Dad’s blood clustered with 
a squirrel Bartonella subgroup. This observation supports 
the presence of a novel Bartonella species on the eastern 
shore of Maryland, an as yet undeﬁ ned animal reservoir, 
and an unknown arthropod vector.
Regardless of the mode(s) of transmission, repeated 
molecular documentation of a novel rodent Bartonella sp. 
and B. vinsonii subsp. berkhofﬁ i supports the unexpected 
failure of 2 intensive courses of intravenous and oral anti-
microbial drugs to eliminate these fastidious, intravascular 
bacteria. During the ﬁ rst two hospitalization periods, there 
was similar and progressive improvement in neurologic 
signs and mental capabilities that began during the fourth 
week of antimicrobial drug administration. Pre-enrichment 
BAPGM growth of B. vinsonii subsp. berkhofﬁ i from blood 
obtained 4 days before death supports persistence of viable 
organisms. Recently, antimicrobial drug resistance genes 
have been characterized in B. bacilliformis, B. henselae, 
and B. quintana by in vitro serial passage (13–15). Retro-
spectively, the relapse in encephalopathic signs might have 
been avoided if antimicrobial drugs were continued for a 
larger interval after discharge from hospital 2, and blood 
Ecologic Complexity of Bartonella spp.
Because of my father’s long-standing atherosclerosis 
and because BAPGM will grow a spectrum of seemingly 
difﬁ cult to isolate bacteria (8,23), pre-enrichment blood 
cultures and Bartonella internal transcribed spacer  region 
PCR had been performed in September 2005 and August 
2006 (Table). Bartonella spp. were not ampliﬁ ed or iso-
lated, which suggests infection occurred after the summer 
of 2006. Transmission of B. henselae, B. vinsonii subsp. 
berkhofﬁ i, and B. alsatica can occur as a result of a scratch 
from a cat, a dog, or a wild rabbit, respectively (17,24–26). 
Cats are the primary reservoir for B. henselae, whereas 
dogs and coyotes are the only reported reservoir hosts for 
B. vinsonii subsp. berkhofﬁ i genotype II in North America 
(27). Recently, B. vinsonii subsp. berkhofﬁ i genotype II was

henselae (9,16,17).
isolated by BAPGM blood culture from a cat with recur-
rent osteomyelitis (E.B. Breitschwerdt, unpub. data), which 
suggests that a bacteremic cat might facilitate transmission 
of this subspecies. My parents had an old (≈21 years of 
age) exclusively outdoor barn cat that would occasional-
ly scratch. The cat could not be tested because it died in 
2007. B. henselae and B. clarridgeae have been transmit-
ted experimentally by transfusion to cats (24). Because B. 
vinsonii subsp. berkhofﬁ i seroconversion occurred during 
hospitalization, transfusion-associated transmission is also 
possible. The exact timing and mode of transmission of B. 
henselae, B. vinsonii subsp. berkhofﬁ i, and the rodent Bar-
tonella sp. to our father cannot be established. However, his 
illness serves to illustrate the medical and ecologic com-
plexity of this genus.
My Father and “One Medicine”
In recent years, there has been renewed interest in the 
concept of “One Medicine” (36). I hope that lessons from 
my father’s death can reinforce the importance of “One 
Medicine.” However, as in the past, rhetoric may not result 
in needed increases in resource allocation to enhance edu-
cational, research, service, and public health capabilities 
of the veterinary profession (37). In the context of vector-
borne infectious diseases, zoonotic diseases, food safety, 
zoologic medicine, and environmental medicine and eco-
system health, to name a few areas, veterinarians continue 
to make major contributions that ensure and enhance the 
daily health of animals and humans. Because of a research 
focus in comparative infectious diseases and knowledge of 
the biologic, immunologic, and pathophysiologic behavior 
of Bartonella spp. in a spectrum of animal species, a vet-
erinary research laboratory was able to assist with the man-
agement of my father’s illness.
As is often true of research at the bedside and the lab-
oratory bench, new lessons and challenges arose from the 
collective efforts of doctors, nurses, veterinarians, research 
scientists, and others attempting to heal my father. I and my 
family remain sincerely grateful to the many doctors, nurses, 
and other caregivers who contributed to the management of 
my father’s surgical and medical problems. Because of the 
severe encephalopathic and combative nature of his behav-
ior, this was frequently not an easy or pleasant task. Dur-
ing his illness, I was struck by several items: 1) most nurses 
are absolutely amazing, caring, and dedicated profession-
als; 2) in human medicine, unlike veterinary medicine, no 
physician claimed or accepted the responsibility to be my 
father’s doctor; and 3) for many reasons, I found the human 
healthcare system to be frayed, if not broken. Whether blame 
lies with the insurance companies, our litigious society, the 
proﬁ t-based motivations of hospital administration, the in-
creased complexity of medical technology, or the medical 
education of physicians, it really does not matter. As my fa-
ther would say, “It is no way to do business.” I have taught 
internal medicine at a College of Veterinary Medicine for 32 
years. During that time, every sick animal on our medical 
service had at least 2 doctors (1 being a student), who were 
directly responsible for the animal’s care, for frequent com-
munications with the owner, and for communications with 
the referring veterinarian. In our increasingly complex hos-
pital environments, every patient needs a personal advocate 
or designated doctor to represent his or her interests.
Occult Infection and Chronic Illness
Reconstructing the history of a chronic illness is al-
ways difﬁ cult and remains an unexacting science due to 
known, unknown, and undetermined factors that inﬂ uence 
disease expression over time. Experimental studies that 
used rodent models have emphasized the ability of Bar-
tonella spp. to invade erythrocytes and vascular endothe-
lial cells (28). In vitro studies indicate that B. henselae can 
infect macrophages, microgial cells, dendritic cells, and 
CD34+ progenitor cells (29). B. henselae and B. vinsonii 
subsp. berkhofﬁ i have been ampliﬁ ed from dog lymph node 
aspiration samples (30). Thus in a given patient, Bartonella 
organisms likely infect a substantial number of cellular 
targets. B. henselae infection induces chronic arthritis in a 
subset of cat scratch disease (CSD) patients, and atypical 
CSD manifestations are more likely to develop in elderly 
patients (31,32). In the context of arthritis, B. henselae and 
B. vinsonii subsp. berkhofﬁ i were repeatedly isolated from 
joint ﬂ uid from a dog in which repeated antimicrobial drug 
therapy was not successful (33). Although a spectrum of 
acute and generally self-limiting neurologic manifestations 
have been historically described in CSD patients, B. hense-
lae and B. vinsonii subsp. berkhofﬁ i were only recently iso-
lated from patients with chronic neurologic and neurocog-
nitive abnormalities (16).
We propose that the initial arthritic signs, short-term 
memory loss, and incoordination were premonitory signs 
of Bartonella spp. infection, and that persistent infection 
contributed to localized edema, nonregenerative anemia, 
thrombocytosis, hyperglobulinemia, and a protracted de-
bilitating illness accompanied by hallucinations, agitation, 
seizures, and death. Agitation, disorientation, and combat-
ive behavior have been reported in association with CSD 
and physicians have implicated Bartonella spp. as con-
tributors to agitation and treatment-resistant depression 
(34,35). Memory loss and a spectrum of neurocognitive 
complaints have also been reported in immunocompetent

oversimpliﬁ cation of the processes that end a person’s life. 
My father and our family were substantially affected dur-
ing his illness. Each day, from initial hospitalization until 
his death, there was at least 1 family member at his side. 
In the eyes of family and friends, my father was a great 
man in so many respects. He was a loving husband, a car-
ing father, diligent worker, and a friend and supporter to 
many persons. Potentially, his illness illustrates a complex 
interaction between intravascular Bartonella infection and 
complex disease expression, provides documentation for 
an as yet uncharacterized zoonotic rodent Bartonella sp., 
and offers disconcerting evidence supporting antimicrobial 
drug ineffectiveness and clinical evidence supporting the 
concept that persistent infection with >1 Bartonella spp. 
may lead to immunosuppression and opportunistic infec-
tions with organisms such as herpes zoster and C. albicans. 
As in his life, Dad would want this story to beneﬁ t others 
after his death. We hope that it does.

ABOUT THE COVER
Rosa Bonheur (1822–1899) Plowing in Nivernais (1850) Oil on canvas (133.4 cm × 259.1 cm) SN433 Collection of the John and Mable

“I think I could turn and live with animals”
—Walt Whitman
Polyxeni Potter
“I 
wed art. It is my husband―my world―my life-
dream―the air I breathe,” said Rosa Bonheur, ex-
plaining her life choices. “Art is absorbent―a tyrant. It de-
mands heart, brain, soul, body, the entireness of its votary.” 
A native of Bordeaux, France, Bonheur was betrothed to 
art early in life, born into a family of artists. They moved 
to Paris when she was still a young child. Precocious and 
headstrong, she had to be coaxed to learn how to read by 
her mother, who had her select and draw an animal for each 
letter of the alphabet. Bonheur later attributed her love of 
drawing animals to this early practice.
During her early days in Paris when the family lived in 
an apartment, she kept a small menagerie of ducks, rabbits, 
squirrels, and a sheep that had to be carried up and down 
the stairs regularly. Expelled from traditional schools for 
rebelliousness by age 12 and refusing to apprentice with 
a seamstress, another conventional option, she was turned 
over to her father Raimond Bonheur, a painter, sculptor, 
and educator, for instruction. She showed herself a dili-
gent and conscientious art student and soon began copying

masterpieces at the Louvre. She assisted him with painting 
commissions and excelled as sculptor. She started visiting 
Paris abattoirs and the École nationale vétérinaire d’Alfort 
to learn animal anatomy by dissecting carcasses. “Oh! 
You’ve got to be devoted to art to live in pools of blood, 
surrounded by butchers.”
She also attended horse fairs and farmers’ markets to 
observe animals’ emotions and behavior. During these out-
ings, “I was forced to recognize that the clothing of my 
sex was a constant bother. That is why I decided to solicit 
the authorization to wear men’s clothing from the prefect 
of police. But the suit I wear is my work attire and noth-
ing else.” Despite her protestations, Bonheur’s independent 
thinking, original approach to societal restrictions, and bo-
hemian lifestyle created an aura of notoriety about her that 
at times eclipsed her artistic accomplishments.
She met and became friends with Étienne Geoffroy 
Saint-Hilaire and his son, Isidore, renowned anatomists and 
zoologists. Her sympathetic portrayal of animals was in-
ﬂ uenced by their studies in natural history, particularly the 
father’s unity of composition principle. He believed that 
all organisms shared the same underlying design and that 
diversity in external form was simple variation. If birds and 
reptiles are built on a single plan, “an accident that befell

ABOUT THE COVER
one of the reptiles … could develop in every part of the 
body the conditions of the ornithological type.”
Bonheur’s style was part of the realist movement of 
the mid-1800s, led by Gustave Courbet and Jean-François 
Millet. In this style, which relied on direct observation and 
meticulous draftsmanship, naturalism was aligned with 
social causes and the labor movement. Despite prevailing 
trends, which favored rural life, the plight of peasants, and 
the ills of growing industrialization, she chose animals as 
her subjects. Even in rural scenes, her focus was on them. 
Her afﬁ nity to animals and her devotion to showing them 
in their natural environment established her as the foremost 
animalière of her century, one of the best of all time.
Although she was aware of the impressionists, Bon-
heur did not adopt their style. For inspiration she turned in-
stead to the Parthenon friezes and the romantic paintings of 
horses by Théodore Géricault and Eugène Delacroix. She 
was also inﬂ uenced by her friend, the acclaimed English 
animal painter Edward Landseer.
Her work attracted early attention. She began exhibit-
ing in the Salon at age 19 and continued to exhibit there 
successfully over many years. She stopped showing sculp-
ture when she became aware of her brother Isidore’s talent 
in that art. She “did not want to hinder [his] artistic career.” 
Her painting Cows and Bulls of the Cantal received a gold 
medal at the Salon. After this success she received a com-
mission from the government to create a painting of ani-
mals at work in the ﬁ elds. The work, Plowing in Nivernais, 
was very well received.
When her father died, she succeeded him as director of 
the art school for girls where he had worked. At that time 
she also established a studio with friend and fellow artist 
Nathalie Micas and began to work on massive paintings 
of horses. One of these, The Horse Fair, became a sensa-
tion and attracted the attention of Britain’s Queen Victoria. 
Bonheur’s fame was far-reaching. She received the Cross 
of San Carlos of Mexico; membership in the Académie des 
Beaux-Arts of Antwerp, Belgium; the Commander’s Cross 
of the Royal Order of Isabella from Spain’s Alphonso XII; 
and the French Legion of Honor. She handled fame grace-
fully and wore the medals.
As her commercial success increased, she was able 
to move to a chateau outside Paris near the forest of Fon-
tainebleau. On these spacious grounds, she created a small 
zoo, with ponies, deer, monkeys, cattle, and other ani-
mals that populated her future work. “One of her pets was 
a young lion whom she allowed to run about and often 
romped with.”
Bonheur’s fascination with the New World and the 
American West began with Buffalo Bill’s Wild West ex-
travaganza, a combination of circus and historical reenact-
ment, during its European tour through France. She trav-
eled to the United States and painted American themes and 
a famous portrait of Buffalo Bill Cody, who became her 
friend. Her interest in the United States led to her long con-
nection with Anna Klumpke, an American artist, who after 
Bonheur’s death, found hundreds of paintings and drawings 
unseen by anyone in her friend’s studio and pulled together 
the artist’s (auto)biography.
Plowing in Nivernais, on this month’s cover, is a copy 
by Bonheur of the original government commission, made 
a year later and likely inspired by The Devil’s Pool, a novel 
by George Sand (1804–1876). This story, about the dis-
placement of peasants by industrialization, contained the 
lines, “But what caught my attention was a truly beautiful 
sight, a noble subject for a painter. At the far end of the ﬂ at 
plow land, a handsome young man was driving a magniﬁ -
cent team [of] oxen.” Bonheur lived in Nivernais, in central 
France, for weeks, observing the animals and the land, the 
people at work, the agricultural tools. Her depiction was so 
accurate that the region was immediately identiﬁ ed when 
the painting was unveiled.
“Oxen that rattle the yoke and chain or halt in the leafy 
shade, what is that you express in your eyes?” wondered 
Walt Whitman in his poem Song of Myself, “It seems to me 
more than all the print I have read in my life.” In Bonheur’s 
own “poem,” the massive beasts crisscross the good earth, 
plowing uphill. Slow and solid, they dominate a landscape 
vast as the sky, tails whisking, mucus glistening. The peas-
ants are in the sidelines. Small and unimposing, they follow 
or step next to them, light-footed, like dancers. The man 
toward the front holds a thin stick above his head, exert-
ing dominance, choreographing the animals’ movements. 
He is their colleague, a member of the herd, who grooms 
and feeds them and lives with them. The animal in the lead 
squints ahead, one that follows looks directly at us. Indus-
trialization has not yet arrived in this agrarian corner.
Nineteenth-century concerns about the spread of ur-
banization have only grown in our times. The percentage of 
residents in urban areas is projected to increase from 50% 
in 2008 to 70% in 2025. But along with displacement of 
agriculture, other fears cloud the horizon. Crowded urban 
areas have become uniquely vulnerable to public health 
crises, not least of them pandemic (H1N1) 2009. Recent 
outbreaks in Mexico City and New York demonstrate that 
surveillance efforts and management of public health com-
munication and response demand exceptional alertness and 
coordination.
And the animals? “[T]hey are so placid and self 
contan’d, / I stand and look at them long and long,” wrote 
Whitman when he offered to “turn and live with” them. For 
the poet, they held as much fascination as for Bonheur, who 
ﬁ rst brought them into her apartment and later established 
them in her own zoo at Fontainebleau, shunning portraiture 
and trendy interiors to paint them exclusively. He was at-
tracted to their non-humanness, “They do not sweat and

whine about their condition, / They do not lie awake in the 
dark and weep for their sins.” Furthermore, “Not one is dis-
satisﬁ ed, not one is demented with the mania of owning 
things, / Not one kneels to another, nor to his kind that lived 
thousands of years ago, / Not one is respectable or unhappy 
over the earth.”
Bonheur understood animals. Her unconventional spir-
it was drawn to their wildness. “I too am not a bit tamed, I 
too am untranslatable, / I sound my barbaric yawp over the 
roofs of the world.” But, like the poet, she did not know 
all we share with them. Her furry friends in the apartment 
or the chateau―rodents, rabbits, goats, deer, cattle, lions-
and some that she did not collect, appear in the pages of 
this issue. For they share with us not just living space but 
countless infections.
How could the artist have known the litany of zoonoses 
that continue to complicate our relationship with animals: 
highly pathogenic inﬂ uenza A virus (H5N1) in backyard

raccoons, coyotes, and red foxes; Ehrlichia chaffeensis in 
Sika Deer; Mycobacterium bovis and M. tuberculosis from 
goats. We have learned to live and work with animals. Now 
if we could also choreograph the microbes we all share ….

Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 15, No. 12, December 2009
Emerging Infectious Diseases is a peer-reviewed journal established expressly to promote the recognition of new and 
reemerging infectious diseases around the world and improve the understanding of factors involved in disease emergence, prevention, and elimination. 
The journal is intended for professionals in infectious diseases and related sciences. We welcome contributions from infectious disease specialists in 
academia, industry, clinical practice, and public health, as well as from specialists in economics, social sciences, and other disciplines. Manuscripts in all 
categories should explain the contents in public health terms. For information on manuscript categories and suitability of proposed articles see below and 
visit www.cdc.gov/eid/ncidod/ EID/instruct.htm.
Emerging Infectious Diseases is published in English. To expedite publication, we post articles online ahead of print. Partial translations of the journal 
are available in Japanese (print only), Chinese, French, and Spanish (www.cdc. gov/ncidod/EID/trans.htm).
Instructions to Authors
MANUSCRIPT PREPARATION. For word processing, use MS Word. List the fol-
lowing information in this order: title page, article summary line, keywords, ab-
stract, text, acknowledgments, biographical sketch, references, tables, ﬁ gure 
legends, appendixes, and ﬁ gures. Each ﬁ gure should be in a separate ﬁ le. 
Synopses. Articles should be under 3,500 words and should include ref-
erences, not to exceed 40. Use of subheadings in the main body of the text 
is recommended. Photographs and illustrations are encouraged. Provide a 
short abstract (150 words), a one-sentence summary of the conclusions,  
and a brief biographical sketch. This section comprises concise reviews of 
infectious diseases or closely related topics. Preference is given to reviews 
of new and emerging diseases; however, timely updates of other diseases or 
topics are also welcome. If detailed methods are included, a separate section 
on experimental procedures should immediately follow the body of the text. 
Title Page. Give complete information about each author (i.e., full name, 
graduate degree(s), afﬁ liation, and the name of the institution in which the 
work was done). Clearly identify the corresponding author and provide that 
author’s mailing address (include phone number, fax number, and email ad-
dress). Include separate word counts for abstract and text. 
Keywords. Include up to 10 keywords; use terms listed in Medical Subject 
Headings Index Medicus.
Research Studies. Articles should be under 3,500 words and should in-
clude references, not to exceed 40. Use of subheadings in the main body 
of the text is recommended. Photographs and illustrations are encouraged. 
Provide a short abstract (150 words), a one-sentence summary, and a brief 
biographical sketch. Report laboratory and epidemiologic results within a 
public health perspective. Explain the value of the research in public health 
terms and place the ﬁ ndings in a larger perspective (i.e., “Here is what we 
found, and here is what the ﬁ ndings mean”).
Text. Double-space everything, including the title page, abstract, refer-
ences, tables, and ﬁ gure legends. Indent paragraphs; leave no extra space 
between paragraphs. After a period, leave only one space before beginning 
the next sentence. Use 12-point Times New Roman font and format with 
ragged right margins (left align). Italicize (rather than underline) scientiﬁ c 
names when needed. 
Biographical Sketch. Include a short biographical sketch of the ﬁ rst au-
thor—both authors if only two. Include afﬁ liations and the author’s primary 
research interests. 
Policy and Historical Reviews. Articles should be under 3,500 words 
and should include references, not to exceed 40. Use of subheadings in the 
main body of the text is recommended. Photographs and illustrations are 
encouraged. Provide a short abstract (150 words), a one-sentence summary 
of the conclusions, and a brief biographical sketch. Articles in this section 
include public health policy or historical reports that are based on research 
and analysis of emerging disease issues.
References. Follow Uniform Requirements (www.icmje.org/index.html). 
Do not use endnotes for references. Place reference numbers in parenthe-
ses, not superscripts. Number citations in order of appearance (including in 
text, ﬁ gures, and tables). Cite personal communications, unpublished data, 
and manuscripts in preparation or submitted for publication in parentheses in 
text. Consult List of Journals Indexed in Index Medicus for accepted journal 
abbreviations; if a journal is not listed, spell out the journal title. List the ﬁ rst 
six authors followed by “et al.” Do not cite references in the abstract.
Dispatches. Articles should be no more than 1,200 words and need not 
be divided into sections. If subheadings are used, they should be general, 
e.g., “The Study” and “Conclusions.” Provide a brief abstract (50 words); ref-
erences (not to exceed 15); ﬁ gures or illustrations (not to exceed 2); tables 
(not to exceed 2); and a brief biographical sketch. Dispatches are updates 
on infectious disease trends and research. The articles include descriptions 
of new methods for detecting, characterizing, or subtyping new or reemerg-
ing pathogens. Developments in antimicrobial drugs, vaccines, or infectious 
disease prevention or elimination programs are appropriate. Case reports 
are also welcome. 
Tables. Provide tables within the manuscript ﬁ le, not as separate ﬁ les. Use 
the MS Word table tool, no columns, tabs, spaces, or other programs. Footnote 
any use of boldface. Tables should be no wider than 17 cm. Condense or di-
vide larger tables. Extensive tables may be made available online only.  
Commentaries. Thoughtful discussions (500–1,000 words) of current 
topics. Commentaries may contain references but no ﬁ gures or tables.
Another Dimension. Thoughtful essays, short stories, or poems on philo-
sophical issues related to science, medical practice, and human health. Top-
ics may include science and the human condition, the unanticipated side of 
epidemic investigations, or how people perceive and cope with infection and 
illness. This section is intended to evoke compassion for human suffering 
and to expand the science reader’s literary scope. Manuscripts are selected 
for publication as much for their content (the experiences they describe) as 
for their literary merit.
Figures. Provide ﬁ gures as separate ﬁ les, not embedded in MS Word. 
Use Arial font for text content. Place keys within ﬁ gure area. Provide foot-
notes and other information (e.g., source/copyright data, explanation of bold-
face) in ﬁ gure legend. Submit ﬁ gures with text content in native, editable, PC 
ﬁ le formats (e.g., MS Excel/PowerPoint). Submit image ﬁ les (e.g., electro-
micrographs) without text content as high-resolution (300 dpi/ppi minimum) 
TIFF or JPG ﬁ les. Submit separate ﬁ les for multiple ﬁ gure panels (e.g., A, B, 
C). EPS ﬁ les are admissible but should be saved with fonts embedded (not 
converted to lines). No PNG or BMP ﬁ les are admissible. For additional guid-
ance, contact fue7@cdc.gov or 404-639-1250.
MANUSCRIPT SUBMISSION. Include a cover letter indicating the proposed 
category of the article (e.g., Research, Dispatch) and verifying that the ﬁ nal 
manuscript has been seen and approved by all authors. Complete provided 
Authors Checklist. To submit a manuscript, access Manuscript Central from 
the Emerging Infectious Diseases web page (www.cdc.gov/eid).
Letters. Letters commenting on recent articles as well as letters reporting 
cases, outbreaks, or original research are welcome. Letters commenting on 
articles should contain no more than 300 words and 5 references; they are 
more likely to be published if submitted within 4 weeks of the original article’s 
publication. Letters reporting cases, outbreaks, or original research should 
contain no more than 800 words and 10 references. They may have 1 ﬁ gure 
or table and should not be divided into sections. All letters should contain 
material not previously published and include a word count.
Types of Articles
Books, Other Media. Reviews (250–500 words) of new books or other 
media on emerging disease issues are welcome. Name, publisher, number 
of pages, other pertinent details should be included.
Announcements. We welcome brief announcements (50–150 words) of 
timely events of interest to our readers. (Announcements may be posted 
online only, depending on the event date.) 
Conference Summaries. Summaries of emerging infectious disease 
conference activities are published online only. Summaries, which should 
contain 500–1,000 words, should focus on content rather than process and 
may provide illustrations, references, and links to full reports of conference 
activities.
Perspectives. Articles should be under 3,500 words and should include 
references, not to exceed 40. Use of subheadings in the main body of the 
text is recommended. Photographs and illustrations are encouraged. Pro-
vide a short abstract (150 words), a one-sentence summary of the conclu-
sions, and a brief biographical sketch. Articles in this section should provide 
insightful analysis and commentary about new and reemerging infectious 
diseases and related issues. Perspectives may also address factors known 
to inﬂ uence the emergence of diseases, including microbial adaptation and 
change, human demographics and behavior, technology and industry, eco-
nomic development and land use, international travel and commerce, and 
the breakdown of public health measures. If detailed methods are included, 
a separate section on experimental procedures should immediately follow 
the body of the text.
