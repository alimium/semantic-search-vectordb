September 11, 2015 
subjected to an external visual examination and retested and 
marked in accordance with the UE procedure described herein  
and DWC January 25, 2005 application for special permit on 
file with the Office of Hazardous Materials Safety Approvals 
and Permits Division (OHMSAPD).   
 
Additionally, DOT cylinders made of aluminum alloy 6351 must 
be examined by the eddy current (EE) procedure described 
herein and DWC January 25, 2005 application for special permit 
on file with OHMSAPD. A cylinder that has been exposed to fire 
or to excessive heat may not be retested under the terms of 
this special permit. 
 
b. Equipment and Performance.   
 
(1) Ultrasonic System - The ultrasonic equipment 
performance must conform to the DWC’s February 1, 2005 
application on file with OHMSAPD and as prescribed in 
this special permit. The UE equipment incorporates a 
single-channel or a multi-channel immersion system 
arranged to perform straight and angle beam 
examinations. The ultrasonic pulses must enter into the 
cylinder wall in both longitudinal, both 
circumferential directions and normal to the cylinder 
wall to ensure 100 percent coverage of the cylinder 
wall. The system must be set-up to perform longitudinal 
ultrasonic angle beams from the cylinder shoulder down 
to the cylinder base area and from the cylinder base up 
to the cylinder shoulder. Also the system must be set-
up to perform circumferential ultrasonic angle beams in 
both clockwise and counterclockwise rotation around the 
cylinder. All defects (such as isolated pits, line 
corrosion, sidewall defects (e.g. cracks, folds) and 
line corrosion must be detected. The transducer or 
cylinder must be arranged so that the ultrasonic beams 
enter into the cylinder wall and measure thickness and 
detect the sidewall flaws. The immersion UE system must 
have a high speed board to digitize and capture each A-
scan during examination of the cylinder. Gain control 
accuracy must be checked for a new Ultrasonic System 
with equipment that is calibrated in accordance with 
industry standards for checking gain linearity accuracy 
as published in the ASTM-E317 standard. Search units of 
2.25 to 10 MHz nominal frequency and 1/4" to a 1" 
diameter must be used during ultrasonic examination. A 
manual contact shear or longitudinal search unit may be 
used for confirmation and sizing of an indicated 
defect. If manual UE is used, it must be performed  
 
Continuation of DOT-SP 14149 (20th Rev.)

under direct supervision of a Senior Review 
Technologist by a minimum Level II operator and in 
accordance with American Society of Testing Materials 
(ASTM) practice E 213. 
 
(2) Eddy Current Equipment - Equipment, such as Visual 
Plus or Visual Eddy, must be capable of detecting the 
notches on the standard reference ring.  
 
c. Standard References 
 
(1) 
UE Reference Cylinder - A cylinder or a cylinder 
section must be used as a standard reference and must 
have similar acoustic properties, surface finish and 
metallurgical condition as the cylinders under test.   
The standard reference, (reference cylinder) must have a 
known minimum design wall thickness (tm) which is less 
than or equal to the cylinder under test. The standard 
reference cylinder for cylinders less than or equal to 6-
inches in diameter must have the same nominal diameter as 
the cylinder being tested with a tolerance of +0%/-30%.   
 
Cylinders greater than 6-inches in diameter must conform 
to the allowable size ranges shown in the following

prepared to include the following artificial defects: 
 
 
 
 
(i)  The artificial defect for area corrosion will 
be 0.70 square inch (in2) and the remaining wall 
thickness must be at least the design minimum wall 
for a cylinder being tested. 
 
(ii)  The artificial defect for isolated pits in 
cylinders less than or equal to 4 inches in diameter 
consisting of an internal flat bottom hole (FBH) of 
1/8 inch diameter and 1/3tm in depth. 
 
(iii)  The artificial defect for isolated pits in 
cylinders greater than 4 inches in diameter 
consisting of an internal FBH of 1/4 inch diameter 
and 1/3tm in depth. 
 
(iv)  The artificial defect for line corrosion 
consisting of two circumferential (one internal and 
one external) and two longitudinal(one internal and 
one external) notches. These notches shall be 
electro discharge machine (EDM), measuring 0.10 tm in 
depth, 1 inch in length and less than or equal to 
0.010 inch width. 
 
(3)  A certification statement signed by a DWC senior 
review technologist (SRT) must be available for all 
standard references at each site where retesting is 
performed. The certification statement must include a 
standard reference drawing for each size of cylinder. A 
standard reference drawing must include dimensions and 
the locations of each simulated defect.

must be produced to represent one or more DOT 3AL 
cylinders. The reference ring must include artificial 
notches that simulate neck crack (SLC). The size of 
artificial notch (depth and length) must be obtained 
from the EE equipment manufacturer. A certification 
statement signed by a DWC senior review technologist 
(SRT) must be available for all EE reference rings at 
each site where retesting is performed. The 
certification statement must include a standard 
reference drawing for each reference ring. The standard

d. System Standardization (Calibration) 
 
(1)  Ultrasonic Examination (UE) System Standardization. 
Prior to retesting each specific cylinder design and 
type, the UE system must be standardized for testing by 
using a standard reference. The standard reference must 
be similar (material of construction, size, wall 
thickness, etc.) to the identified cylinders to be 
tested. Standardization of the UE system must be 
performed by using a relevant reference cylinder that is 
described in paragraph 7.c. of this special permit. The 
standardization of the UE system is as follows:   
 
(i)  A reference cylinder with an artificial defect 
made to represent area corrosion must be placed in 
the UE system. The UE system must be standardized to 
indicate rejection for an area equal or greater than 
the machined surface for the cylinder (0.70 in2). 
Where the wall thickness is reduced below tm, a 
straight ultrasound beam must be used to measure the 
wall thickness of the machined area. 
 
(ii)  A reference cylinder with a FBH made to 
represent an isolated pit must be placed in the UE 
system. The FBH must be detected by a minimum of two 
shear wave beams that strike the FBH from opposite 
sides (e.g. the first shear wave direction is from 
top to bottom of the cylinder and the second 
shear wave direction is from the bottom to top).  
The UE gain must be increased until the signal from 
FBH is maximized at 80 percent of the screen height. 
 
(iii)  A reference cylinder with circumferential 
notches made to represent line corrosion must be 
placed in the UE system. Each internal and external 
notch must be detected by a minimum of one shear 
wave beam. The UE gain must be increased until the 
signal from each notch is maximized at 80 percent of 
the screen height. 
 
(iv)  A reference cylinder with longitudinal notches 
to represent a longitudinal sidewall crack (LSC) 
must be placed in the UE system. Each internal and 
external notch must be detected by a minimum of two 
shear wave beams that strike the LSC from opposite 
directions (e.g. the first shear wave direction is 
clockwise and second shear wave direction is 
 
Continuation of DOT-SP 14149 (20th Rev.) 
Page 7 
 
September 11, 2015 
counterclockwise). The UE gain must be increased 
until the signal from the notch is maximized at 80 
percent of the screen height.  
  
(2) Eddy Current Examination (EE) Equipment 
Standardization - The EE equipment must be standardized 
for each type of DOT 3AL cylinder, using the standard 
reference ring that includes simulated neck crack 
notch. The EE system is considered standardized when 
the probe is threaded into the mid-length of 
standardization ring and the sensitivity adjusted to 
produce a spike that crossed the gate (2 screen high) 
as it passes over the simulated neck crack notch.   
The details of the equipment standardization for each 
type of DOT 3AL cylinder must be obtained from the 
manufacturer’s instruction manual included as part of 
this standardization procedure. 
 
e.  Test Procedures. 
 
(1) During the test, each cylinder must be examined by 
the standardized (calibrated) UE system using a relevant 
set-up that is described in paragraph 7.d. of this 
special permit. 
 
(2) 
For each cylinder tested, all 5 scan passes must 
be performed as they are described in paragraph 7.d. 
 
(3)  A UE system that is set-up to perform a 5 pass 
scan may perform a 3 pass scan if the longitudinal and 
circumferential (clockwise) angle beam scans do not 
detect a rejectable flaw. 
  
(4)  A copy of the operating test procedure (as 
authorized in writing by the AAHMS) for performing UE, EE 
and enhanced visual inspection of cylinder necks under 
the terms of this special permit must be at each facility 
performing ultrasonic examination. At a minimum, this 
procedure must include: 
 
(i)  A description of the test set-up; test 
parameters; transducer model number, frequency, and 
size; transducer assembly used; system 
standardization procedures and threshold gain used 
during the test; and other pertinent information.  
 
Continuation of DOT-SP 14149 (20th Rev.)

September 11, 2015 
 
(ii) Requirement for the equipment standardization 
to be performed at the end of the test interval 
(cal-out), after 200 cylinders or four hours, which 
ever occurs first. This cal-out can be considered 
the cal-in for the next interval during continuous 
operation. Cylinders examined during the interval 
between cal-in and cal-out must be quarantined until 
an acceptable cal-out has been performed. An 
acceptable cal-out occurs when the calibration 
cylinder is examined and all required features are 
revealed without changing examination settings. If 
an acceptable cal-out does not occur, if any 
equipment that affects the UE results are replaced 
or altered (such as a search unit or coaxial cable 
etc.) or when a loss of power occurs, all cylinders 
examined since the last successful calibration must 
be re-examined. Additionally, standardization of 
test equipment shall be performed when any of the 
following occurs: the beginning of each work shift; 
when the cylinder under test has dimensions that 
exceed the allowable ranges of the reference 
cylinder; when there is a change of operator(s); if 
any equipment that affects the UE results are 
replaced or altered (such as a search unit or 
coaxial cable etc.) or when a loss of power occurs; 
and at the end of each work shift. 
 
 
 
 
(5)  A written copy of the most recent approved operating 
 
 
test procedures must be provided to a DOT representative 
 
 
when requested. Any change to the written procedures or 
 
 
in UE or EE equipment (software or hardware), other than 
 
 
as supplied by the original equipment manufacturer, must 
 
 
be submitted to and approved by AAHMS prior to  
 
 
 
implementation. 
 
 
(6)  The equipment may not allow testing of a cylinder 
unless the system has been properly standardized 
(calibrated). 
 
(7)  The rotational speed of a reference cylinder must be 
such that all simulated defects are adequately detected, 
measured and recorded. 
 
(8)  The rotational speed of the cylinder under UE must 
not exceed the rotational speed used during the 
standardization. 
 
 
Continuation of DOT-SP 14149 (20th Rev.) 
Page 9 
 
September 11, 2015 
(9)  The pulse rate must be adjusted to ensure a minimum 
of 10% over-lapped for each helix. 
 
(10) The area of ultrasonic examination (UE) coverage 
must be 100% of the cylindrical section. The coverage 
must extend at least three inches into the sidewall-to-
base transition taper. 
 
(11) The area of eddy current and enhanced visual 
examination coverage must be 100% of the threaded neck of 
the cylinder. 
  
(12)  The external surface of the cylinder to be examined 
must be free of loose material such as scale and dirt. 
 
f.  Acceptance/Rejection Criteria 
 
(1)  UE Acceptance/Rejection Criteria.  A cylinder must 
be rejected based on any of the following: 
 
(i)  The wall thickness is less than the design 
minimum wall thickness for the area described in 
the standardization section herein, paragraph 7.d. 
 
(ii)  If any of the flaws such as the isolated 
pit, circumferential line corrosion or 
longitudinal sidewall crack (LSC) which meet the 
rejection criteria and produce a signal with an 
amplitude which crosses the reference threshold 
set in the standardization section (paragraph 
7.d.). 
 
(2)  EE and Enhanced Visual Examination 
Acceptance/Rejection Criteria of the Neck Crack 
(Sustain Load Crack). 
 
(i) 
EE Reject Criteria - One-quarter screen 
height indications on two consecutive revolutions 
of the probe at approximately the same bore 
location are cause for visual follow up inspection 
for final disposition. 
 
(ii) Enhanced Visual Examination/Verification -
Enhanced visual inspection shall be performed 
before and after eddy current examination or when 
required by eddy current examination. The 
inspection is performed with the use of 
supplemental tools, which typically include an 
 
Continuation of DOT-SP 14149 (20th Rev.) 
Page 10 
 
September 11, 2015 
inspection light and mirror. The light is a high 
intensity type and the mirror a 2-inch diameter 2X 
dental mirror. 
 
(A)  Visual Examination Reject Criteria 
 
(1)  Neck Cracks:  Cylinders with neck 
cracks must be condemned. Repair of neck 
cracks is not allowed. 
 
(2)  Folds:  Condemn all cylinders with 
folds that enter into more than one 
continuous full neck thread. 
 
(3)  Valleys:  Cylinders with one or 
more valleys are acceptable for use, 
provided the valley(s) does not enter 
into the minimum number of required 
threads. Seven full threads for tapered 
threads and six full threads for 
straight threads. 
 
(4)  Threads:  Cylinders must be 
condemned if seven continuous full 
threads for tapered threads or six 
continuous full threads for straight 
threads are not present. A thread shall 
be considered full if its root and crest 
display no significant visual difference 
to that of the uppermost cylinder 
thread. Threads that do not meet this 
criteria are considered to be incomplete 
or a partial thread.  
 
(5)  Tool Stop Mark:  A neck with a tool 
stop mark is to be distinguished from a 
crack. Cylinders with tool stop marks 
are acceptable for use. 
 
g. Rejected cylinders:  When a cylinder is rejected, the 
retester must stamp a series of X’s over the DOT specification 
number and marked service pressure, or stamp “CONDEMNED” on 
the shoulder, top head, or neck using a steel stamp, and must 
notify the cylinder owner, in writing, that the cylinder is 
rejected and may not be filled with hazardous material for 
transportation in commerce.   
 
Continuation of DOT-SP 14149 (20th Rev.) 
Page 11 
 
September 11, 2015 
 
(1)  Alternatively, at the direction of the owner, the 
retester may render the cylinder incapable of holding 
pressure. 
 
(2)  If a condemned cylinder contains hazardous materials 
and the testing facility does not have the capability of 
safely removing the hazardous material, the retester must 
stamp the cylinder “CONDEMNED” and affix conspicuous 
labels on the cylinder(s) stating: “UE REJECTED DOT-SP 
14149. RETURNING TO ORIGIN FOR PROPER DISPOSITION”. The 
retester may only offer the condemned cylinders for 
transportation by a motor vehicle operated by a private 
carrier to a facility, identified to, and acknowledged in 
writing with OHMSAPD that is capable of safely removing 
the hazardous material. A current copy of this special 
permit must accompany each shipment of condemned 
cylinders transported for the disposal of hazardous 
material. 
 
h.  Marking. 
Each cylinder passing requalification under the 
provisions of this special permit must be marked as prescribed 
in accordance with § 180.213. In addition, each cylinder must 
be marked UE, in characters not less than 1/4" high for a 
cylinder with a diameter equal to or greater than 4 inches and 
1/8" high for a cylinder with a diameter less than 4 inches. 
DOT 3AL cylinders that were manufactured from AA 6351 and 
examined by eddy current examination must be marked with UE/EE 
in characters described herein. The UE/EE may be replaced by 
UEEE for cylinders with a diameter less than 4 inches. The 
marking must be at a location close to the retester's marking. 
 
i.
