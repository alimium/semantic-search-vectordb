Attachment A – August, 2009 
  
 
The following direction and procedures will be used to establish and charge to wildland fire, 
severity and support job codes in FY 2010: 
Incident job codes will have the region/unit override of the incident host unit.  Incidents that 
qualify for a unique incident job code are as follows and will be established in the FireCode 
system:   
 
 Wildfire incidents 300 acres or more  
 Type 1 or Type 2 IMT is ordered 
 Type 3 organization is used  
 
 
P codes will be established only for direct suppression expenditures through the FireCode 
system.   Base salary will be charged to wildland fire suppression (WFSU) for all employees 
assigned to fire incidents.  
Each land based unit will have one code for ABCD fires.   These codes will be the same as in 
2009, and will be reestablished by ASC for 2010. (see spreadsheet at 
http://www.fs.fed.us/fire/ibp/cost_accounting/cost_accounting.html ) All ABCD codes will be 
used with the region/unit override.  The ABCD code format will be P#XXXX (where # is the 
region number and XXXX is created by the FireCode system).  The ABCD codes will be used 
for the following: 
 Initial response to wildfires. 
 False alarms (including FS response to DOI false alarms) 
 Extended response to wildfires under 300 acres (except as noted above) 
 
Each land based unit will have one code for fire support.  These codes will be used for salary and 
other project support charges by dispatch centers, local caches, and unit employees providing 
general fire support that have traditionally been charged to ABCD Misc.  Support codes will be 
used when an employee is working on multiple fires with different P codes and time cannot 
reasonably be separated out.  If personnel are working on actual support to ongoing ABCD fires, 
they should charge to the ABCD code.  These codes will be the same as 2009 and will be 
reestablished by ASC for 2010.   
P-codes generated from the National Interagency Coordination Center (NICC) will use “W” as 
the second digit in the code.    
The following non-land based units will have a support code for all salary charges:   The ASC, 
National Caches, GACCs, NICC, NIFC, ROs and the WO. When converting from WFPR work 
to WFSU fire support, salary charges will be made to this support code.  Employees at these

Directors                                                                                                                                            
units will charge to a P or F code when they are specifically assigned to an incident or supporting 
only one incident and can identify time in minimum four hours blocks.  WFSU fire support 
codes for non-land based units will change in 2010 from a “WFSU” code to a pre-established 
code generated from Firecode with a WG prefix (WG#### where # is the generated Firecode). 
Each Region will have one P code for staging and/or transporting unassigned resources.  The 
code of the requesting Region will be used on resource orders. Use of this code will be short 
term in nature and be limited to times when resources are being ordered for active fire incidents, 
but the location of the resource assignment is not known. These codes will be pre-established and 
will use the region/unit override in the following format: P#XXXX, where the XXXX is created 
by the FireCode system.  
Units are asked to limit the number of additional codes created in the FireCode system.  While it 
is understood there are situations where the established codes are not adequate for specific needs, 
units should adequately describe the purpose of the code in the FireCode name field. 
The following information is provided to update the appropriate use of incident and severity 
codes for the FY 2010 season. 
P-codes:   
Costs for responses for all size class A, B, C, and D wildfires for each forest will 
be collected under one P-code per Forest, except as noted below.  Format is 
P#XXXX (where # is region and XXXX is created by the FireCode system), 
region/unit override will be used.  Established codes will be posted to the Forest 
Service Incident Business website:   
http://www.fs.fed.us/fire/ibp/cost_accounting/cost_accounting.html. 
 
Do not issue a unique P-code for wildfires under 300 acres unless you are certain 
it meets at least one of the following criteria: 
 Human caused 
 Trespass  
 Expected reimbursement 
 Cost share 
 Type 1, 2, or 3 Incident Management Team assigned 
 
Charge to the ABCD code until such time as you have determined one of the 
above criteria exists.  All wildfires that are size class E, F, or G will be issued a 
unique P-code with the region/unit override. 
 
 
P-codes for 
DOI Fires: 
All Department of Interior (DOI) fire codes will be issued by dispatch personnel 
or a DOI representative through the FireCode system.  Fire codes will pass to the 
FS Financial system only if the fire code is flagged in the FireCode system with 
a value of “Y” for FS Assist. FS Assist should not be checked unless there is 
certainty that there will be Forest Service resources responding. These codes 
allow FS resources to charge to a FireCode in support of DOI fires and will be 
assigned the appropriate letter (D=BLM, A=BIA, P=NPS, R=FWS) after the P.   
An override of 1502 will be used for all DOI fires. 
 
Regional Foresters, Station Directors, Area Director, ITTF Director, Deputy Chiefs and WO     
Directors                                                                                                                                            
H-codes: 
Use H-codes for approved BAER projects.  One H-code will be established for 
each Region to track assessment expenditures for BAER teams.  The H-codes will 
be established in the format:  H#BAER (where # is the Region number).  A 
Regional override will be used. 
 
These unique codes will enhance the ability of each Region to monitor annual 
assessment costs and simplify the process of establishing codes in time-critical 
situations.  It also provides for the transaction code (in accordance with Public 
Law 106-558) to be used for overtime rate equal to one and one-half times the 
hourly rate, which is appropriate for individuals involved in the preparation of a 
BAER plan.  The overtime provisions apply only until the initial BAER plan is 
submitted for approval.  (See FSM 2523.) 
 
Each unit is responsible for contacting the ASC Incident Finance at 
asc_ipc@fs.fed.us  to request H-codes for BAER plan implementation, once the 
plan is approved.  The H-code should mirror the P-code, including the region/unit 
override.  If the P-code was a non FS jurisdictional incident and reflected a 
region/unit override of 1502, the H-code will reflect the region/unit override of 
the requesting unit. 
 
AD Support: A WFSUAD code for AD (Casual) training and Work Capacity Test will be 
issued for each Region.  These codes are to be used for allowable expenditures for 
suppression funds.  A Regional override will be used. 
 
Exclusive Use 
Aviation  
Contracts: 
Each region will be assigned a code for Exclusive Use contract availability as 
designated in the FY 2010 Program Direction.  These codes will be pre-
established code generated from Firecode with a WA prefix (WA#### where # is 
the generated Firecode) with Region/Unit override. 
National aviation contracts will also be assigned a unique code for availability 
payments. 
  
S-codes:   
Each Forest will have two S-codes for severity.  One code for Washington Office 
approved severity and a second code for Regional Office approved severity. 
National severity codes will be established in the format: S#9999 and the 
Regional codes in the format: S#1111.  Region/Unit overrides will be used.  
Please note that OMB is closely monitoring FS use of severity and funding levels 
are being controlled through the apportionment process.  Regions should insure 
that severity funds have been approved prior to charging to severity job codes.

S-codes for  
DOI Severity: Assistance to Department of the Interior severity authorizations will be tracked 
separately.  S-codes will be established to be used by individuals assisting a DOI 
Bureau under a severity request.  Use the following S-codes on all related 
timesheets and travel vouchers.  Do not use the individual severity codes 
established by DOI in the FireCode system as they will not be compatible with 
our systems.

FS Support of  
Non-Federal 
Fires: 
States will not be utilizing the FireCode system to establish codes for non-federal 
fires.  When federal resources respond and provide support to non-federal fires, 
the FS or DOI will create a fire code.  The agency that receives the request 
initially, and fills an order, is responsible for generating the fire code.  These 
codes will be established with PN as the first two characters and the remaining 
four characters/digits will be generated by the FireCode system.  These codes will 
have an override of 1502. 
 
Non-Wildland Federal 
Fire Departments/ 
Agencies: 
Non-wildland Federal fire departments and agencies, including but not limited to 
DOD and Tennessee Valley Authority, will not be utilizing the FireCode system 
to establish codes for their federal fires.  When federal resources respond and 
provide support to Federal non-wildland fire departments or agencies, the FS or  
                        DOI will retrieve a fire code.  The agency that receives the request initially, and 
fills an order, is responsible for generating the fire code.  These codes will be 
established with PF as the first two characters and the remaining four 
characters/digits will be generated by the FireCode system.  Use override 1502. 
 
F-codes for 
FEMA Activations: 
Non-Fire FEMA Incident: A unique F-code will be established for each Mission 
Assignment received from FEMA for ESF4 non-fire activation. ASC-IF will not 
pre-establish these codes in FFIS, however a protocol has been provided in the 
attached spreadsheet for use on non-fire FEMA responses.  FEMA codes will use 
 
Regional Foresters, Station Directors, Area Director, ITTF Director, Deputy Chiefs and WO     
Directors                                                                                                                                            
the region/unit override in the following format:  F#0000 where # is the Region in 
which the response is taking place.  ASC-Incident Finance shall be notified by the 
Region or National Office, as soon as a job code has been assigned so that it can 
be established for use in FFIS.  ASC-IF must also be provided a copy of the 
Mission Assignment (MA). 
 
Fire ESF4 Incident: Utilize FireCode for ESF4 wildland fire activations.  ESF4 
Fire Mission Assignments are the only MAs where multiple job codes can be 
assigned. The majority of FEMA ESF4 fires will start out with a PN**** or 
P#**** Firecode. When the fire is assigned to ESF4, the P code will change to a 
F#**** where # is the Region number, and **** is the same Firecode as the P 
code. For example PNLMNO would change to F#LMNO. In situations where the 
fire did not start out as a state PN code, assign a Firecode with a prefix of F#.  
This will provide consistency with the current job code process for wildfire and 
will maintain the integrity of the fire costs for the specific fire.  Each fire covered 
by the MA will have a unique F code.  ASC-IF will be notified, as soon as a job 
code has been assigned or converted from a P# so that it can be established for use 
in FFIS.  ASC-IF must also be provided a copy of the Mission Assignment. 
 
 
Base salary of all employees on assignment to a declared emergency will be paid 
from the Emergency Operations (WFSU) account.    
Non-Fire  
Emergency  
Job Codes: 
Upon execution of an interagency reimbursable agreement the Unit should request 
a unique reimbursable job code with the appropriate reimbursable program and 
fund.  Contact ASC-Incident Finance to create the code prior to incurring any 
expenses.  Do not create a fire code in the FireCode system for non fire 
emergencies.    
   
Fire codes are processed into FFIS as they are created in the FireCode system.  The job code 
cycles in FFIS do not run on Friday and Saturday night.  Therefore, incident job codes passed to 
FFIS on Friday and Saturday nights will not be available for use (in Paycheck and other systems) 
until after processing on Sunday night.
