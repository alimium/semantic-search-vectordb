WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Representative Mike Quigley (IL-05) honored Holocaust
Remembrance Day, which began at sundown yesterday and continues until sundown this
evening.
  
“During this Holocaust Remembrance Day, we must never forget what happened during one of
the darkest chapters of history,” said Rep. Quigley. “The memory does not dissipate with time,
not for me, and certainly not for the hundreds of thousands who suffered and lost loved ones
during the Holocaust.  It is a solemn reminder of the history Jewish people carry each day and
why our commitment to the state of Israel is so important.”
  
During a trip to Poland in January , Rep. Quigley, along with Senator Mark Kirk (IL), visited the
Auschwitz-Birkenau Memorial and Museum in Poland, where he laid a wreath in front of the
execution wall.
