Actual on-dates and off-dates are dependant on range readiness and when allowable use standards 
are met.  The Forest Service may approve changes to the grazing rotation in consultation with 
you, to address range condition and situations that may occur due to forage condition or weather 
related circumstances. 
 
2. 
Grazing Management 
 
It is strongly suggested that livestock be moved before utilization standards are met.  If allowable 
use levels are met early in the scheduled pasture, cattle will be rotated into the next pasture or off 
the Forest This should prevent non-compliance of standards, allowing for time to clean the unit of 
stragglers. 
 
Monitoring will be conducted to measure utilization of riparian and upland vegetation throughout 
the grazing year. 
 
The following illustrates last year’s rotation:

Cattle are to be completely removed from a pasture by the off date. I will allow you two weeks 
prior to the off date to begin moving cattle into the next pasture.  If two weeks is not adequate, you 
must request additional time from this office.  Please notify this office when you begin to move 
cattle and when a pasture rotation is complete. 
 
Permittees with livestock in rested units, grazing units outside the season of use, and grazing areas 
not authorized in advance, will be non-compliant with the terms and conditions of their Term 
Grazing Permit.  Appropriate action, including billing at the unauthorized use rate, may be taken. 
 
3. 
Gila National Forest Management Direction 
 
Your Term Grazing Permit includes the specific maximum allowable utilization levels applicable to 
your allotment.  Allowable use is calculated at a point-in-time.  To comply with standards in the Gila 
National Forest Plan, livestock must be moved to another unit or remove them from National Forest 
System lands regardless of the time remaining in the grazing season before utilization standards are met. 
 
You are responsible for tracking and complying with your permitted forage use levels.  For your 
convenience, the South Wahoo C&H Allotment maximum allowable forage utilization levels are listed 
below: 
 
South Wahoo C&H Allotment:  
 
The following utilization standards will be applied on the South Wahoo Allotment: 
 
• Up to 30% allowable use on all key areas. 
 
Range Improvements 
 
Range improvements must be maintained to standard before cattle are allowed into a pasture.  It is the 
permittee’s responsibility to ensure that range improvements remain functional.  This includes boundary 
fences in pastures not currently being grazed.  Routine maintenance of existing improvements does not 
require written clearance; however, construction/reconstruction of new improvements must be 
authorized in writing from this office. 
 
2006 Improvement Planned: 
 
• We apologize that we were unable to complete the work on the two dirt tanks that we 
began last year. At our annual validation meeting we discussed that cleaning out the Bear 
Tank would be our first priority for grazing year 2006 and we will try and accomplish 
that work this spring.  Completed ⁭ Not Completed ⁭ 
 
2009 Improvements Planned (Work or Supplies Needed from 2006 and New Projects)

____________________________________________________________________________________
When improvements have been maintained, please call the Black Range Ranger Station and 
report that maintenance has been completed.  If verification is not received from the permittee, 
2 
inspections will be made.  During that inspection, if we find maintenance has not been completed, 
and livestock are grazing an area unscheduled for use at the time, they will be considered 
unauthorized.  Permittees may be billed for unauthorized use and/or permit action taken for 
maintenance.   
 
All water developments must provide access and escape to and from water for all types of wildlife.  
Please contact the Kameron or Shane for assistance. 
 
1. Monitoring 
 
Key areas for monitoring are identified as riparian areas and transect cluster locations.  Additional key 
areas may be identified during the season based on routine monitoring. 
 
The idea of a key area is to find a site that is representative of a larger area in which cattle obtain the 
majority of their required forage resources.  Key area monitoring will avoid areas directly adjacent to 
permanent water sources, cattle trails, roads, and fence lines.   
 
Upland areas will be monitored for use on perennial grass species. 
 
District personnel will contact the permittees to coordinate site visits to monitor key areas.  Permittee 
participation is encouraged.  Forage utilization estimates will be consistent with the Forest Service 
Range Analysis Handbook methodology, and may also include FS Regional stubble-height standards, as 
well as other techniques generally accepted in the field of range management.   
 
2. Special Management Instructions 
 
he following restrictions will be implemented so that management remains in compliance with the 
Endangered Species Act.  The instructions below relate to threatened, endangered, and proposed to be 
listed species as well as range/watershed conditions. 
 
• There are no documentations that identify any protected and restricted Mexican Spotted Owl 
habitat on the South Wahoo Allotment, therefore there are no restrictions regarding the Mexican 
Spotted Owl. 
• Stock tanks must be surveyed for possible aquatic habitat before earth-disturbing maintenance is 
authorized. 
• The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service listed the Chiricahua leopard frog as a threatened species in 
2002. We have completed grazing consultation on your allotment regarding the effects of 
livestock grazing on the Chiricahua leopard frog. We determined that livestock grazing will 
either have no effect or will not adversely affect the Chiricahua leopard frog. As a result of this 
determination, there were no changes required of your grazing permit. The U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service concurred with this determination. Therefore, consultation has been completed. 
A copy of this consultation is on file with your local Ranger District.  
The Endangered Species Act requires that actions funded or carried out by the federal government go 
through the consultation process to insure these actions do not jeopardize the continued existence of a 
listed species. Please notify this office of any planned earth disturbing activities involving riparian 
areas, dirt tanks, or other sources of open water.

3. Other Instructions 
 
On yearlong ranges, calves under six months of age on January 1st will be counted against the 
authorized numbers.  By April 1st, these calves must be removed from the Forest or counted 
against the authorized numbers. 
 
The permittee must obtain permission from this office, before conducting earth- disturbing activities on 
the National Forest.  The Forest Service will arrange inspections of project areas and will prepare 
appropriate environmental and cultural documents before earth-disturbing activities proceed.  These 
activities include road/earthen tank maintenance, as well as construction/reconstruction of trails, roads, 
earthen tanks, etc.  Do not conduct any earth-disturbing activities using heavy equipment on the Forest 
without written clearance from this office.   
 
Salt must be located at least ¼ mile from water, and preferably on ridges and/or areas of low use.  Do 
not place salt blocks in the same location as the previous year, and locate blocks on hard ground not 
susceptible to erosion. Supplemental feeding, other than mineral or supplement block, is not authorized 
on the National Forest.  
 
Accurate records of your operation will aid in planning and determining the effectiveness of the grazing 
system.  Please maintain reasonably accurate records of cattle numbers throughout the grazing season.   
 
The Annual Operating Instructions are a part of the Term Grazing Permit as provided for in Part 1, 
Section 3.  These instructions comply with the standards and guidelines found in the Forest Plan, 
including the 1996 Forest Plan Amendment.  They also comply with the Endangered Species Act found 
in the Biological Assessment for the South Wahoo Allotment.  Any additional information collected 
during the year may be incorporated into the Annual Operating Instructions.    
These instructions are not subject to administrative review, pursuant to 36 CFR 251. 
Your compliance with these instructions is essential for the proper management of National Forest 
System lands.  Failure to comply with the terms and conditions of your permit and these instructions 
may result in issuance of a notice of noncompliance with the terms of your grazing permit.  If needed 
during the grazing season, changes can be made in these instructions, provided the changes are first 
approved and documented by the District Ranger or other authorized Forest Service officer. 
 
We look forward to working with you and solicit your cooperation and involvement in bringing about 
sound range and livestock management practices that will enhance all of the allotment's resources.  If 
you have any ideas or suggestions that will improve the management of this allotment, we would like to 
hear from you.
