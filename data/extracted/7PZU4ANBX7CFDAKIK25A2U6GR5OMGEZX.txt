Wasatch Front Imagery Update
Posted by Rick Kelson - 2009/04/21 16:42
_____________________________________
The majority of the Salt Lake County 12.5cm imagery was collected today. Mapcon will be moving north to collect the
other 12.5cm areas over the next few days. I looks as if weather may become a factor again by the end of the week. The
flights will resume again after the weather clears.

_*Image Acquisition:*_�
All project areas have been flown and the data has been reduced to 6629 �
individual RGB files that are stored in an uncompressed straight TIFF �
format. The associated ABGPS/IMU data has been delivered to you. This �
portion of the project has been invoiced and payment has been received.�
�
_*Metadata:*_�
Attached is a draft document as an example of the files to be delivered. �
I have indicated by highlighting the fields which require your input �
(yellow) and those that will change based upon the individual ortho tile �
attributes (cyan). We await your review and feedback.�
�
_*Aerial Triangulation/Orthophoto Production:�
*_The Salt Lake County block (1535 images) has been run and we are �
waiting for additional source imagery (2006 12.5 cm) to extend the �
existing control network. Delivery of the orthophoto tiles for this �
block should occur within 3 weeks of receipt of the above mentioned images.�
�
The Northern 12.cm block (2203 images) is in the initial AT process. �
Weber County has provided you with authorization to release the 2006 �
imagery. Weber County also placed additional survey control targets for �
the Upper Ogden Valley area, but we have not received the control list �
as of today. Davis County has indicated that release of the 2006 imagery �
should be forthcoming. We anticipate delivery of the orthophoto tiles �
for this block by the first week of August.�
�
The Wasatch Front 25 cm imagery (1517 images) would follow the �
completion of the 12.5 cm imagery with an expected delivery by the end �
of August.�
�
The control for the Dugway 25 cm imagery (1374 images) has been �
completed and I will deliver the source data to you next week. This area �
will use separate production resources from the Wasatch Front area and �
we anticipate completion prior to the end of August.

The Salt Lake County 12.5 cm block (1535 images) is complete.  Delivery �
of the orthophoto tiles occurred on August 8th.  Two of the 2000 M tiles �
from this block will be re-delivered as four1000 M tiles.  These tiles �
along with the relevant support data (metadata files, index sheet and �
shape file) will be delivered by August 27th.  Attached is a preliminary �
AT report.�
�
The AT process for the Northern 12.5 cm block (2205 images) is �
complete.  A preliminary AT report will be delivered by August 27th.  We �
estimate delivery of the orthophoto for this block tiles by September 10th.�

The AT is underway for the Dugway 25 cm imagery (1374 images).  We �
anticipate completion of this and the orthophoto process by September 4th.�
�
The AT process for the Wasatch Front 25 cm imagery (1517 images) is also �
in production.  Delivery of these orthophoto tiles and the re-sampled �
12.5 cm to 25 cm tiles will occur by September 30th.�

It is our intention to provide a single formal Aerial Triangulation �
report for entire project and deliver the same by the end of September.
