Members of Congress Question FDA Proposal Designed to Create Liability Shield for Drug and Device Co
    
Today Representatives Henry A. Waxman, John D. Dingell, Frank Pallone, Jr., Rosa L.
DeLauro, and Edward Markey, and Senators Edward M. Kennedy, Patrick J. Leahy, and
Christopher J. Dodd, questioned the basis for a new Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
proposal that was apparently designed to shield pharmaceutical and device companies from
liability for injuries sustained by American consumers as a result of unsafe products.
  
“We are concerned that the intent of this proposal is to protect companies in the pharmaceutical
and device industry from being held liable for marketing products they know are unsafe,” said
the members in a letter to FDA Commissioner von Eschenbach. “Such a policy change comes
at the expense of consumers and violates the mission of the FDA.”
  
FDA’s proposed rule would amend the regulations that permit companies to promptly update
their drug and device labels with new safety information without waiting for FDA approval. 
These regulations serve the vitally important public health function of ensuring that patients and
healthcare providers are made aware of safety risks associated with their medical products at
the earliest possible moment.
  
Given that FDA failed to identify a public health basis for why this lengthy proposal was
necessary at this point in time, the letter’s authors ask FDA to answer questions justifying the
expenditure of the agency’s limited resources on this effort.
