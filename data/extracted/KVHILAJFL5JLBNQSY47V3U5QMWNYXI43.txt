each engine family in the trading pro-
gram: 
(1) The engine family; 
(2) The actual quarterly and cumu-
lative applicable production/sales vol-
ume; 
(3) The values required to calculate 
credits as given in § 89.207; 
(4) The resulting type and number of 
credits generated/required; 
(5) How and where credit surpluses 
are dispersed; and 
(6) How and through what means 
credit deficits are met. 
(d) The manufacturer must retain all 
records required to be maintained 
under this section for a period of eight 
years from the due date for the end-of- 
model-year report. Records may be re-
tained as hard copy or reduced to 
microfilm, ADP diskettes, and so forth, 
depending 
on 
the 
manufacturer’s 
record retention procedure; provided, 
that in every case all information con-
tained in the hard copy is retained. 
(e) Nothing in this section limits the 
Administrator’s discretion in requiring 
the manufacturer to retain additional 
records or submit information not spe-
cifically required by this section. 
(f) Pursuant to a request made by the 
Administrator, the manufacturer must 
submit to the Administrator the infor-
mation that the manufacturer is re-
quired to retain. 
(g) EPA may void ab initio under 
§ 89.126(c) a certificate of conformity 
for an engine family for which the 
manufacturer 
fails 
to 
retain 
the 
records required in this section or to 
provide such information to the Ad-
ministrator upon request.

§ 89.211
End-of-year and final reports. 
(a) End-of-year and final reports 
must indicate the engine family, the 
actual applicable production/sales vol-
ume, the values required to calculate 
credits as given in § 89.207, and the 
number of credits generated/required. 
Manufacturers must also submit how 
and where credit surpluses were dis-
persed (or are to be banked) and/or how 
and through what means credit deficits 
were met. Copies of contracts related 
to credit trading must be included or 
supplied by the broker, if applicable. 
The report shall include a calculation 
of credit balances to show that the 
summation of the manufacturer’s use 
of credits results in a credit balance 
equal to or greater than zero, except as 
allowed under § 89.203(c)(3)(ii). Manufac-
turers participating under the program 
described in § 89.203(c)(3)(ii) shall in-
clude the NMHC + NOX credit balance 
and the PM credit balance as of Decem-
ber 31 of that calendar year. 
(b) The applicable production/sales 
volume for end-of-year and final re-
ports must be based on the location of 
the point of first retail sale (for exam-
ple, retail customer, dealer, secondary 
manufacturer) also called the final 
product purchase location. 
(c)(1) End-of-year reports must be 
submitted within 90 days of the end of 
the model year to: Director, Engine 
Programs and Compliance Division 
(6405-J), U.S. Environmental Protec-
tion Agency, 401 M St., SW., Wash-
ington, DC 20460. 
(2) Final reports must be submitted 
within 270 days of the end of the model 
year to: Director, Engine Programs and 
Compliance Division (6405-J), U.S. En-
vironmental Protection Agency, 401 M 
St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. 
(d) Failure by a manufacturer par-
ticipating in the averaging, banking, or 
trading program to submit any end-of- 
year or final reports in the specified 
time for all engines is a violation of 
sections 203(a)(1) and 213 of the Clean 
Air Act for each engine. 
(e) A manufacturer generating cred-
its for deposit only who fails to submit 
end-of-year reports in the applicable 
specified time period (90 days after the 
end of the model year) may not use the 
credits until such reports are received 
and reviewed by EPA. Use of projected 
credits pending EPA review is not per-
mitted in these circumstances. 
(f) Errors discovered by EPA or the 
manufacturer in the end-of-year report, 
including errors in credit calculation, 
may be corrected in the final report up 
to 270 days from the end of the model 
year. 
(g) If EPA or the manufacturer deter-
mines that a reporting error occurred 
on an end-of-year or final report pre-
viously submitted to EPA under this 
section, the manufacturer’s credits and

(h) of this section. Erroneous negative 
credit balances may be adjusted by 
EPA. 
(h) If within 270 days of the end of the 
model year, EPA review determines a 
reporting error in the manufacturer’s 
favor (that is, resulting in an increased 
credit balance) or if the manufacturer 
discovers such an error within 270 days 
of the end of the model year, the cred-
its shall be restored for use by the 
manufacturer.

Subpart D—Emission Test 
Equipment Provisions 
[59 FR 31335, June 17, 1994. Redesignated at 63 
FR 56995, Oct. 23, 1998] 
§ 89.301
Scope; applicability. 
(a) This subpart describes the equip-
ment required in order to perform ex-
haust emission tests on new nonroad 
compression-ignition engines subject 
to the provisions of subpart B of part 
89. 
(b) Exhaust gases, either raw or di-
lute, are sampled while the test engine 
is operated using an 8-mode test cycle 
on an engine dynamometer. The ex-
haust gases receive specific component 
analysis determining concentration of 
pollutant, exhaust volume, the fuel 
flow, and the power output during each 
mode. Emission is reported as grams 
per kilowatt hour (g/kw-hr). See sub-
part E of this part for a complete de-
scription of the test procedure. 
(c) General equipment and calibra-
tion requirements are given in § 89.304 
through 89.324. Sections 89.325 through 
§ 89.304
Equipment required for gas-
eous emissions; overview. 
(a) All engines subject to this subpart 
are tested for exhaust emissions. En-
gines are operated on dynamometers 
meeting the specification given in 
§ 89.306. 
(b) The exhaust is tested for gaseous 
emissions using a raw gas sampling 
system as described in § 89.412 or a con-
stant volume sampling (CVS) system 
as described in § 89.419. Both systems 
require analyzers (see paragraph (c) of 
this section) specific to the pollutant 
being measured. 
(c) Analyzers used are a non-disper-
sive infrared (NDIR) absorption type 
for carbon monoxide and carbon diox-
ide analysis; a heated flame ionization 
(HFID) type for hydrocarbon analysis; 
and 
a 
chemiluminescent 
detector
