Course Number
FHWA-NHI-310108
Course Title
Federal Lands 101
During these times of economic expansion and growth, there are dramatic workforce changes taking place. With the 
passage of TEA-21, the program for Federal Lands Highway (FLH) nearly doubled and there is the prospect that it will 
again increase under pending transportation reauthorization. Due to this change, coupled with the increasing demand 
by our partners and customers for more technical assistance, FLH needs to develop the knowledge of their new/mid-
career hires in the area of FLH operations and regulations.
Therefore, the overall course goal is to provide FLH employees with an overview of how FLH operates in order to 
administer programs, deliver projects, develop and transfer technology, and provide external training.
Outcomes
Upon completion of the course, participants will be able to:
•  Identify the role and authorities of FLH within the FHWA and its interactions with Federal-aid divisions
• Describe unique aspects of FLH customers and programs
• Describe how FLH delivers projects
• Describe how FLH conducts business, including processes and resources
Target Audience
New hires to FLH in all positions and grades and Federal-aid (particularly new employees) and Federal Lands 
Management Agency employees upon request.
