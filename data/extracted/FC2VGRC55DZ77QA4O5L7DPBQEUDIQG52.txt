TALC AND PYROPHYLLITE
By Robert L. Virta
Domestic survey data and tables were prepared by Christopher H. Lindsay, statistical assistant, and the world production
table was prepared by Glenn J. Wallace, international data coordinator.
presented in table 1; the remainder was estimated from reported
prior-year data adjusted according to industry trends.
Pyrophyllite.—Standard Industrial Minerals Inc. operated
one mine in California, and Piedmont Minerals Co. and
Standard Mineral Co. Inc. operated three mines in North
Carolina.  Production of pyrophyllite decreased from that of
1998.
Domestic production data were acquired through a voluntary
USGS survey of the three U.S. companies that mine
pyrophyllite.  All responded to the survey.
Consumption
The mineral talc is a hydrous magnesium silicate.  A massive
talcose rock is called steatite, and an impure massive variety is
known as soapstone.  Talc is used commercially because of its
fragrance retention, luster, purity, softness, and whiteness. 
Other commercially important properties of talc are its
chemical inertness, high dielectric strength, high thermal
conductivity, low electrical conductivity, and oil and grease
adsorption.  Major markets for talc are ceramics, paint, paper,
and plastics.
Pyrophyllite is a hydrous aluminum silicate with a structure
similar to talc.  Such properties as chemical inertness, high
dielectric strength, high melting point, and low electrical
conductivity make it useful for ceramic and refractory
applications.
Legislation and Government Programs
In 1999, the U.S. Department of Defense authorized the
disposal of 907 metric tons (t) of block and lump talc from the
National Defense Stockpile, which is the entire uncommitted
inventory in that category; 2 t was sold.
Production
Talc.—In 1999, 9 companies operating 13 mines in 6 States
produced soapstone, steatite, and talc.  All but one operation
were open pit mines.  The producers were, in decreasing order
of production, Luzenac America Inc., Barrett’s Minerals Inc.,
Dal Minerals Co., Gouverneur Talc Co., Milwhite Inc.,
Suzorite Mineral Products Inc. (Zemex Corp.), Unimin Texas
Co. L.P. (formerly United Clays Inc. of Texas), Steatite of
Southern Oregon, and NuTECH Minerals Inc.  Barrett’s
Minerals, Dal Minerals, Gouverneur Talc, and Luzenac
America were the largest domestic producers, accounting for
more than 80% of the tonnage.
In 1999, U.S. mine production was 925,000 t valued at $26.1
million, compared with 971,000 t valued at $27.3 million in
1998 (tables 1 and 2).  Production increased slightly in New
York; decreased in California, Montana, Texas, and Vermont;
and remained unchanged in Oregon.  Montana led all States in
the tonnage and value of talc produced, followed by Texas,
Vermont, New York, Oregon, and California.  Mines that
operated in Montana, New York, Texas, and Vermont
accounted for nearly all the domestic talc production.
Domestic production data were obtained through a voluntary
U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) survey of U.S. mining
companies.  Survey forms were sent to 10 companies with
responses accounting for approximately 80% of the data
Talc.—Approximately 881,000 t of talc valued at $102
million was sold or used in 1999, an increase from 870,000 t
valued at $109 million in 1998.  Sales or use of talc increased
in Montana and Texas; decreased in California, New York, and
Vermont; and remained essentially unchanged in Oregon.  Of
the 881,000 t of talc sold or used, producers reported that
771,000 t was sold for domestic use and approximately 110,000
t was exported.
Domestic markets included, in decreasing order of
consumption, ceramics (pottery, sanitaryware, tiles, etc.),
paper, paint, plastics, roofing, cosmetics, rubber, insecticides,
and refractories (table 3).  Domestic sales of talc did not change
significantly between 1998 and 1999.
About 73,000 t of talc was reported under the “Other”
category by respondents in 1999.  Of this amount, 55,600 t was
used in animal feed additives, automobile body fillers, caulks,
joint compounds, paint and putties, sculpture media, tile
flooring, and vinyl sheet flooring.  The remainder of the
“Other” category (17,400 t) was used in applications that were
not identified by respondents.
Most of the imported talc was not included in the domestic
end-use data listed in table 3.  More than 80% of the imported
talc was purchased by mineral brokers who do not participate in
the USGS canvass.  An estimate of the end-use breakdown
based on countries of origin, ports of entry, importing
companies, and regional end-use patterns is ceramics and
refractories, 15,000 t; cosmetics, 8,000 t; paint, 31,000 t; paper,
12,000 t; plastics, 80,000 t; rubber, 9,000 t; and unknown,
23,000 t.
Pyrophyllite.—Domestic consumption of pyrophyllite
decreased from that of 1998.  Pyrophyllite was used, in
decreasing order of consumption, in ceramics, refractories,
paint, plastics, insecticides, and rubber.  Sales increased for
paint and plastics applications and decreased for the others. 
Ceramic and refractory uses accounted for 61% of domestic

pyrophyllite sales.
Domestic consumption data for talc and pyrophyllite were
developed by the USGS from a voluntary survey of U.S. mills. 
Survey forms were sent to 11 companies operating 16 mills in 8
States for talc and 3 companies operating 3 mills in 2 States for
pyrophyllite.  Approximately 87% of the talc data presented in
table 3 was reported by the companies; the remainder was
estimated from reported prior-year data adjusted according to
industry trends.  All the pyrophyllite producers responded to
the consumption survey.
Prices
all talc imports (table 6).  Some of the talc imported from Japan
was likely to have been transshipments from other Southeast
Asian countries or Australia.
Approximately 50% (103,000 t) of talc imported into the
United States came through the port district of New Orleans,
LA, almost all unmilled.  Of this amount, 6,700 t was imported
from Australia; 86,700 t from China; 68 t from France; 8,990 t
from Hong Kong; and 244 t from Italy.  The second leading
port district was Detroit, MI, with 25,400 t (principally from
Canada); followed by Boston, MA, with 21,000 t (principally
from France); and Buffalo, NY, with 12,400 t (principally from
Canada).  The remaining imports were scattered among the
many other port districts.
World Review
Talc prices varied depending on the quality and the degree
and method of processing.  The unit value of crude talc was
estimated to be $28 per metric ton.  More than 80% of the
crude ore value included in table 1 was estimated because most
producers do not sell crude talc and could not provide a crude
ore value.  The average reported unit value of processed talc
was $116 per ton.  The average unit values of crude and
processed pyrophyllite increased slightly in 1999.
The average unit value for exports of unmilled talc was $114
per ton, and that of milled talc was $195 per ton.  The average
unit value for imports was $83 per ton for unground talc, $161
per ton for ground talc, and $932 per ton for cut or sawed talc.
Bidding for export licenses on 250,000 t of Chinese talc took
place in March 1999.  Licenses, in general, increased about $8
per ton to $20 per ton.  Industry experts believe that much of
the increase in licensing costs could be absorbed through cost
reductions by Chinese talc producers (Mineral PriceWatch,
1999).
Approximate prices for talc ranged from $83 to $371 per ton
(table 4; Industrial Minerals, 1999d).  Quoted prices should be
used only as a guideline because actual prices depend on the
terms of the contract between seller and buyer.
Foreign Trade
Talc exports increased slightly in tonnage, to 147,000 t, and
5% in value, to $27.2 million.  Canada was the leading
importer of U.S. talc, followed by Mexico, Belgium, Japan,
Venezuela (7,220 t), and Taiwan (4,560 t) (table 5).  Since
1990, data reported by domestic producers concerning exports
to Mexico gradually have diverged from the Bureau of the
Census data.  On the basis of industry data, exports to Mexico
are estimated to be more than three times those reported by the
Bureau of the Census.
Talc imports reported by the Bureau of the Census increased
by 26% in tonnage, to 208,000 t, and increased by 52% in
value, to $35.3 million.  Such a large tonnage increase probably
could not be absorbed by current talc markets and it is likely
that much was processed and stockpiled for future sales.  Cut
and sawed talc, which has a unit value of $932 per ton,
contributed disproportionately to the large increase in the
import value compared with import values for unmilled and
milled talc.  Canada, China, France, and Japan supplied 89% of 
China remained the world’s leading producer of talc,
followed by the United States, Brazil, India, Finland, and
France.  The Republic of Korea was the largest producer of
pyrophyllite, followed by Japan and Brazil.  China, Japan, the
Republic of Korea, and the United States produced 69% of the
world’s talc and pyrophyllite (table 7).
Australia.—WMC Resources Ltd. announced plans to build
an $11 million mill with a capacity of 35,000 to 40,000 metric
tons per year (t/yr) at either its Three Springs or Kwinana site. 
The mill will permit WMC to use talc from its Three Springs
mine for higher value applications.  The paper and paint
markets in Australia and Southeast Asia are being served by the
company’s Amsterdam plant (Industrial Minerals, 1999e).
Canada.—Highwood Resources Ltd. acquired a talc mine
and mill from Canada Talc Ltd.  The mine and mill are located
in Madoc, Ontario.  Highwood Resources is beginning
underground development at the mine to improve access to
higher grade ore.  The company also is upgrading the mill
facilities (Industrial Minerals, 1999b).
Trinity Resources and Energy Ltd. began preparing its
pyrophyllite mine and mill, which have been idle since 1995,
for operation.  In 1998, the company acquired the mine and
mill, located in Newfoundland, from Armstrong World
Industries Canada Ltd.  The purchase included the mine, mill,
1 million tons of reserves, and ceramic- and mixed-grade
stocks.  The company expects to be fully operational in 2000
and intends to diversify from ceramics into pigment and filler
markets, such as paint, plastic, and roofing (North American
Minerals News, 1999).
Italy.—Luzenac Val Chisone SpA opened an underground
mine in Rodoretto.  The deposit contains high-purity, white,
macrocrystalline ore.  Luzenac anticipates that production will
be 60,000 t/yr.  The talc will be sold for polymer, cosmetic,
pharmaceutical, and coating applications (Industrial Minerals,
1999c).
Mexico.—Luzenac Europe acquired 51% ownership of
Sierra Talc de Mexico, SA de CV.  Sierra Talc is a toll
grinding operation with an average output of 40,000 t/yr.  It has
mines in Guerrero and Puebla and mills in Monterrey and
Mexico City.  The company mines about 10% of its feed

Markets for talc should be stable and even slightly increasing
for the next few years.  Major markets for talc, such as
ceramics, paint, paper, and plastics, are projected to grow
slowly through 2003 as a result of the strong U.S. economy. 
The plastics market should continue to offer the greatest growth
potential for talc, and imports will play a larger role in the U.S.
talc market.  No major changes are anticipated in pyrophyllite
markets, and consumption probably will not change
significantly for the next few years.
