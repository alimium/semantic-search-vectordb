time is necessary to develop factual in-
formation that the OCC determines is
necessary to consider the application;
or
(iii) The OCC determines that other
extenuating circumstances exist.
(3) Applicant response. The OCC may
give the applicant an opportunity to
respond to comments received.
§ 5.11
Hearings and other meetings.
data, supplementary information, and
information submitted by interested
persons, to the extent that those docu-
ments have not been afforded confiden-
tial treatment. Applicants and other
interested persons may request that
confidential treatment be afforded in-
formation submitted to the OCC pursu-
ant to paragraph (c) of this section.
(c) Confidential treatment. The appli-
cant or an interested person submit-
ting information may request that spe-
cific information be treated as con-
fidential under the Freedom of Infor-
mation Act, 5 U.S.C. 552 (see 12 CFR
4.12(b)). A submitter should draft its re-
quest for confidential treatment nar-
rowly to extend only to those portions
of a document it considers to be con-
fidential. If a submitter requests con-
fidential treatment for information
that the OCC does not consider to be
confidential, the OCC may include that
information in the public file after pro-
viding notice to the submitter. More-
over, at its own initiative, the OCC
may determine that certain informa-
tion should be treated as confidential
and withhold that information from
the public file. A person requesting in-
formation withheld from the public file
should submit the request to the Dis-
closure Officer, Communications Divi-
sion, under the procedures described in
12 CFR part 4, subpart B. That request
may be subject to the predisclosure no-
tice procedures of 12 CFR 4.16.
(a) Hearing requests. Prior to the end
of the comment period, any person may
submit to the appropriate district of-
fice a written request for a hearing on
a filing. The request must describe the
nature of the issues or facts to be pre-
sented and the reasons why written
submissions would be insufficient to
make an adequate presentation of
those issues or facts to the OCC. A per-
son requesting a hearing shall simulta-
neously submit a copy of the request to
the applicant.
(b) Action on a hearing request. The
OCC may grant or deny a request for a
hearing and may limit the issues to
those it deems relevant or material.
The OCC generally grants a hearing re-
quest only if the OCC determines that
written submissions would be insuffi-
cient or that a hearing would otherwise
benefit the decisionmaking process.
The OCC also may order a hearing if it
concludes that a hearing would be in
the public interest.
(c) Denial of a hearing request. If the
OCC denies a hearing request, it shall
notify the person requesting the hear-
ing of the reason for the denial.
(d) OCC procedures prior to the hear-
ing—(1) Notice of Hearing. The OCC
issues a Notice of Hearing if it grants a
request for a hearing or orders a hear-
ing because it is in the public interest.
The OCC sends a copy of the Notice of
Hearing to the applicant, to the person
requesting the hearing, and anyone
else requesting a copy. The Notice of
Hearing states the subject and date of
the filing, the time and place of the
hearing, and the issues to be addressed.
(2) Presiding officer. The OCC appoints
a presiding officer to conduct the hear-
ing. The presiding officer is responsible
for all procedural questions not gov-
erned by this section.
§ 5.10
Comments.
(a) Submission of comments. During the
comment period, any person may sub-
mit written comments on a filing to
the appropriate district office.
(b) Comment period—(1) General. Un-
less otherwise stated, the comment pe-
riod is 30 days after publication of the
public notice required by § 5.8(a).
(2) Extension. The OCC may extend
the comment period if:
(i) The applicant fails to file all re-
quired publicly available information
on a timely basis to permit review by
interested persons or makes a request
for confidential treatment not granted
by the OCC that delays the public
availability of that information;
(ii) Any person requesting an exten-
sion 
of 
time

onstrates to the OCC that additional
