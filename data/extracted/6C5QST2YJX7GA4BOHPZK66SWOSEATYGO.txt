December 1, 2009: Congressman Wittman Statement on President's Afghanistan Decision  
WASHINGTON, D.C. - This evening, Congressman Rob Wittman released the following
statement regarding the President's decision on the way ahead in Afghanistan.        
 
  
"I'm pleased that the President has come to a decision on the future strategy of our forces in
Afghanistan and I fully support the deployment of additional troops and resources to aid in the
fight against extremists. However, I am concerned with the mention of any sort of hard and fast
time table. This simply sends the wrong message to the civilian population and provides a time
clock for al-Qaeda and the Taliban to wait for our departure. We need to remember that the
reason we went to Afghanistan was to eliminate al-Qaeda and provide freedom to an oppressed
nation, and we should not leave until that job is finished. I have full faith and confidence in our
military leadership and our troops that they will successfully complete this mission and I call on
the President, Congress, and our Allies to provide them the tools to get the job done."
  
  
 
  
Congressman Rob Wittman represents the First District of Virginia. He was elected to his first
full term in November 2008 and serves on the Natural Resources Committee and the Armed
Services Committee where he is the Ranking Member of the Oversight and Investigations
Subcommittee.
