Title: Regulations Governing the

OMB Control Number: 0581–0128. 
Summary of Collection: The 
Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 (60 
Stat. 1087–1091, as amended; 7 U.S.C. 
1621–1627) (AMA) directs and 
authorizes the Department to develop 
standards of quality, grades, grading 
programs, and services to enable a more 
orderly marketing of agricultural 
products so trading may be facilitated 
and so consumers may be able to obtain 
products graded and identified under 
USDA programs. The Agricultural 
Marketing Service (AMS) carries out 
regulations, which provide a voluntary 
program for grading shell eggs on the 
basis of U.S. standards, grades, and 
weight classes. In addition, the shell egg 
industry and users of the products have 
requested that other types of voluntary 
services be developed and provided 
under these regulations. This program is 
voluntary where respondents would 
need to request or apply for the specific 
service they wish. 
Need and Use of the Information: 
Only authorized representatives of the 
USDA used the information collected. 
The information is used to administer, 
conduct and carry out the grading 
services requested by the respondents. If 
the information were not collected, the 
agency would not be able to provide the 
voluntary grading service authorized 
and requested by congress, provide the 
types of services requested by industry, 
administer the program, ensure properly 
grade-labeled products, calculate the 
cost of the service or collect for the cost 
furnishing service. 
Description of Respondents: Business 
or other for profit; Federal Government; 
State, Local or Tribal Government. 
Number of Respondents: 623. 
Frequency of Responses: Reporting: 
On occasion; semi-annually; monthly; 
annually; other (daily). 
Total Burden Hours: 5,630.
