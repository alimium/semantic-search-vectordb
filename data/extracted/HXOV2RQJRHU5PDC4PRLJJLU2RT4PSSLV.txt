Nonstandard Terms
FFEL and DL – Loan Period
�  The minimum loan period is generally the lesser of
    the academic year or program.  May be greater than
    an academic year.
�  If the terms are substantially equal, the loan period
    may be a term.
�  A loan period may not exceed 12 calendar months.
28
Nonstandard Terms
FFEL and DL – Delivery
�  If terms are substantially equal in length, delivery
    is in substantially equal amounts by payment
    period, i. e., by term.
�  If a loan period is one payment period, there must
    be at least two deliveries of loan proceeds.
    Second delivery is after the calendar midpoint
    between the loan period’s first and last scheduled
    days of class.
29
Nonstandard Terms
FFEL and DL – Delivery
�  If terms are not substantially equal in length,
   delivery is not by payment period.
�  Delivery of the second half of the loan proceeds
    after the later of--
6 The calendar midpoint between the first and last
     scheduled days of the loan period; or
