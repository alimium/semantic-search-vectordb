Supplemental Security Income
The Social Security program—Old-Age, Survivors, 
and Disability Insurance (OASDI)—provides monthly 
benefits to workers and their families when the worker 
retires, dies, or becomes disabled. The amount of the 
worker’s retirement insurance (old-age) or disability 
benefit is based on the worker’s level of earnings in 
employment or self-employment covered by the Social 
Security program. Monthly benefits are payable to 
retired workers at age 62 (with reduced benefits) or to 
disabled workers at any age. The benefit amount for an 
auxiliary or survivor beneficiary is based on a percent-
age of the worker’s benefit. Auxiliary and survivor 
beneficiaries must generally meet an age, disability, or 
child care requirement.
