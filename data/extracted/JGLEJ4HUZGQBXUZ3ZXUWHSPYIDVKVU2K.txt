Civil Motion Practice
A.
REQUIREMENT TO SEEK CONCURRENCE: 
The Court requires adherence to E.D. Mich. LR 7.1(a). Requirements for discovery motions
are set forth under the Discovery section of these Practice Guidelines.
B.
BRIEFS AND BRIEFING SCHEDULE ON MOTIONS: 
The Court adheres to E.D. Mich. LR 5.1 and 7.1 regarding format and form of motions and
briefs, and the type of briefs required and permitted. In addition, all briefs must contain an
index of exhibits, and the Court suggests a table of contents for briefs over ten pages.
Deviations from the length and/or timing of briefs under these Rules must be by leave of
Court. Failure to file timely briefs may result in those briefs being stricken, and untimely reply
briefs may not be considered. Tendering of courtesy copies is addressed separately below.
C.
HEARINGS/ORAL ARGUMENT ON MOTIONS: 
Except in pro se prisoner cases, the Court generally hears oral argument on civil motions.
Upon filing or referral, the Court will notify the parties of the date and time of a hearing.
However, pursuant to E.D. Mich. LR 7.1(f), the Court may cancel a scheduled hearing or
decide the matter without a hearing where the issues can be decided on the briefs.
D.
COURTESY COPIES: 
If a motion, response or reply (including exhibits) totals more than 20 pages, a courtesy copy
of the motion and exhibits shall be provided to the Courtâ€™s chambers, either by hand delivery
or by mail within five days of the date it was electronically filed. Exhibits on the courtesy copy
must be separated by tabs, and relevant portions of exhibits must be highlighted. The courtesy
copy should be a filed copy containing the electronic date stamp on the top. 
E.
ORDERS: 
Generally, the Court prepares its own orders. However, if a motion is resolved prior to hearing
or decision, the Court may require the parties to prepare and file a stipulation and proposed
order.
