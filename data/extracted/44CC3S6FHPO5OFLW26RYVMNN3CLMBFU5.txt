How are funds for school-
based 
service-learning 
programs 
distributed? 
(a) Of the amounts appropriated to

tribes and U.S. Territories to be allot-
ted in accordance with their respective 
needs. 
(b) The Corporation will use the re-
mainder of the funds appropriated as

poration may make grants on a com-
petitive basis to States, Indian tribes, 
or grantmaking entities. 
(2) Allotments to States. 
(i) From 37.5 percent of the remain-
der, the Corporation will allot to each

ratio to 37.5 percent of the remainder 
as the number of school-age youth in 
the State bears to the total number of 
school-age youth of all States. 
(ii) From 37.5 percent of the remain-
der, the Corporation will allot to each 
State an amount that bears the same 
ratio to 37.5 percent of the remainder

sions of paragraph (b)(2) of this section, 
no State will receive an allotment that 
is less than the allotment the State re-
ceived for fiscal year 1993 from the 
Commission on National and Commu-
nity Service. If the amount of funds 
made available in a fiscal year is insuf-
ficient to make those allotments, the 
Corporation will make additional funds
