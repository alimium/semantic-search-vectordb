The process p¯p → γ + jet+ X is studied using 1.0 fb−1 of data collected by the D0 detector at the
Fermilab Tevatron p¯p collider at a center-of-mass energy √s =1.96 TeV. Photons are reconstructed in
the central rapidity region |yγ|<1.0 with transverse momenta in the range 30<pγ
T <400 GeV while
jets are reconstructed in either the central |yjet|< 0.8 or forward 1.5< |yjet|< 2.5 rapidity intervals
with pjet
T > 15 GeV. The diﬀerential cross section d3σ/dpγ
T dyγdyjet is measured as a function of pγ
T
in four regions, diﬀering by the relative orientations of the photon and the jet in rapidity. Ratios
between the diﬀerential cross sections in each region are also presented. Next-to-leading order QCD
predictions using diﬀerent parameterizations of parton distribution functions and theoretical scale
4
choices are compared to the data. The predictions do not simultaneously describe the measured
normalization and pγ
T dependence of the cross section in the four measured regions.

The production of a photon with associated jets in
the ﬁnal state is a powerful probe of the dynamics of
hard QCD interactions [1–6]. Diﬀerent angular conﬁg-
urations between the photon and the jets can be used
to extend inclusive photon production measurements [7–
10] and simultaneously test the underlying dynamics of
QCD hard-scattering subprocesses in diﬀerent regions of
parton momentum fraction x and large hard-scattering
scales Q2.
In this Letter, we present an analysis of photon plus
jets production in p¯p collisions at a center-of-mass en-
ergy √s =1.96 TeV in which the most-energetic (leading)
photon is produced centrally with a rapidity |yγ| < 1.0
[11]. The cross section as a function of photon transverse
momentum pγ
T is measured diﬀerentially for four sepa-
rate angular conﬁgurations of the highest pT (leading)
jet and the leading photon rapidities. The leading jet is
required to be in either the central (|yjet|<0.8) or forward
(1.5<|yjet|<2.5) rapidity intervals, with pjet
T > 15 GeV,
and the four angular conﬁgurations studied are: central
jets with yγ·yjet > 0 and with yγ·yjet < 0, and forward jets
with yγ·yjet > 0 and with yγ·yjet < 0. The total x and Q2
x1 ≲ 0.024, 0.110 ≲ x2 ≲ 0.300 for yγ ·yjet > 0 and
0.097 ≲ x1 ≲ 0.264, 0.022 ≲ x2 ≲ 0.059 for yγ ·yjet < 0).
Here x1,2 are deﬁned using the leading order approxima-
tion x1,2 = (pγ
T /√s)(e±yγ + e±yjet) [1–6].
The data presented here correspond to an integrated
luminosity of 1.01 ± 0.06 fb−1 [22] collected using the D0
detector at the Fermilab Tevatron p¯p collider operating
at a center-of-mass energy √s =1.96 TeV. A detailed
description of the D0 detector can be found in [23] and
only an overview of the detector components relevant to
this analysis is given here.
Photon
candidates
are
formed
from
clusters
of
calorimeter cells in the central part of the liquid-argon
and uranium calorimeter. The central calorimeter cov-
ers the pseudorapidity range |η| < 1.1 and two end
calorimeters cover 1.5 < |η| < 4.2 [24].
The electro-
magnetic (EM) section of the central calorimeter con-
tains four longitudinal layers of 2, 2, 7, and 10 radiation
lengths, and is ﬁnely-segmented transversely into cells of
size ∆η × ∆φ = 0.1 × 0.1 (0.05 × 0.05 in the third EM
layer), providing good angular resolution for photons and
electrons. The position and width of the Z boson mass
peak, reconstructed from Z → e+e− events, are used
to determine the EM calorimeter calibration factors and
the EM energy resolution [25]. The central section of the
calorimeter surrounds a central preshower detector, with
three concentric cylindrical layers of scintillator strips,
and a tracking system consisting of silicon microstrip and

FIG. 1: The fraction of events, estimated using the pythia

region covered by the measurement is 0.007 ≲ x ≲ 0.8
and 900 ≤ Q2 ≡ (pγ
T )2 ≤ 1.6 × 105 GeV2, extending
the kinematic reach of previous photon plus jet measure-
ments [12–18]. Ratios between the diﬀerential cross sec-
tions in the four studied angular conﬁgurations are also
presented. The measurements are compared to the cor-
responding theoretical predictions.
Isolated ﬁnal-state photons produced in p¯p → γ +jet+
X events are expected to mainly originate “directly” from
QCD Compton-like qg → qγ scattering or q¯q → gγ an-
nihilation subprocesses. In Fig. 1 the expected contri-
bution, estimated using pythia [19] Monte Carlo (MC)
event generator with the CTEQ6.5M parton distribution
function (PDF) set [20], of the Compton-like partonic
scattering process to the total associated production of
a photon and a jet is shown for each of the four mea-
sured rapidity intervals. The parton distribution func-
tions entering into the theoretical predictions have sub-
stantial uncertainties, particularly for the gluon contri-
butions at small x, large x and large Q2 [20, 21]. The
measurement intervals probe diﬀerent regions of parton
momentum-fraction space of the two initial interacting
partons, x1,2. For example at pγ
T = 40 GeV, in events
with a central leading jet, the yγ ·yjet > 0 region covers
adjacent x1 and x2 intervals (0.016 ≲ x1 ≲ 0.040 and
0.040 ≲ x2 ≲ 0.100), while for events with yγ ·yjet < 0,
the x1 and x2 intervals are similar (0.029 ≲ x1 ≲ 0.074,
0.027 ≲ x2 ≲ 0.065). In events with a forward leading
jet, intervals of small and large x are covered (0.009 ≲

scintillating ﬁber trackers located within a 2 T solenoidal
magnetic ﬁeld.
The D0 tracking system is used to select events which
contain a primary collision vertex, reconstructed with at
least three tracks, within 50 cm of the center of the de-
tector along the beam axis. The eﬃciency of the vertex
requirement varies as a function of instantaneous lumi-
nosity from 92% to 96%.
Photon candidates with rapidity |yγ| < 1.0 are selected
from clusters of calorimeter cells within a cone of radius
R ≡
�
(∆η)2 + (∆φ)2 = 0.4 deﬁned around a seed tower
[23]. The ﬁnal cluster energy is then re-calculated from
the inner cone with R = 0.2. The data are selected us-
ing a combination of triggers based on photon EM shower
proﬁles and in the calorimeter and EM cluster pT thresh-
olds.
The total trigger eﬃciency is (96–97)% for pho-
ton candidates with pγ
T ≈ 32 GeV and greater than 99%
for pγ
T > 40 GeV. The selected clusters are required to
have greater than 96% of their total energy contained
in the EM calorimeter layers. Isolated clusters are se-
lected by requiring that the energy EEM(R = 0.2), calcu-
lated within the inner cone of radius R = 0.2, fulﬁlls the
condition [Etotal(R = 0.4) − EEM(R = 0.2)]/EEM(R =
0.2) < 0.07, where Etotal(R = 0.4) is the summed EM
and hadronic energy within a cone of radius R = 0.4.
The candidate EM cluster is required not to be spatially
matched to a reconstructed track. This is accomplished
by computing a χ2 function evaluating the consistency,
within uncertainties, between the reconstructed η and
φ positions of the cluster and the closest track in the
ﬁnely-segmented third layer of the EM calorimeter. The
corresponding χ2 probability is required to be < 0.1%.
Background contributions to the direct photon sample
from cosmic rays and from isolated electrons, originat-
ing from the leptonic decays of W bosons, important
at high pγ
T [26], are suppressed by requiring the missing
transverse energy ̸ET , calculated as a vector sum of the
transverse energies of all calorimeter cells, to satisfy the
condition ̸ET < 12.5+0.36 pγ
T GeV. The longitudinal seg-
mentation of the EM calorimeter and central preshower
detector allow us to estimate the photon candidate direc-
tion and vertex coordinate along the beam axis (”photon
vertex pointing”). This vertex is required to lie within
10 cm of the event primary vertex reconstructed from
charged particles.
Photons arising from decays of π0 and η mesons are
already largely suppressed by the requirements above,
and especially by photon isolation, since these mesons
are produced mainly within jets during fragmentation
and are surrounded by other particles. To better select
photons and estimate the residual background, an ar-
tiﬁcial neural network (ANN) is constructed using the
jetnet package [27]. The following three variables are
used in the ANN: the number of cells in the ﬁrst EM
layer belonging to the cluster, the fraction of the cluster
energy deposited in the ﬁrst EM layer, and the scalar
sum of charged particle transverse momenta in the hol-
low cone 0.05 ≤ R ≤ 0.4 around the photon cluster di-
rection. The resulting ANN output, ONN, after applying
all data selection criteria, is shown, normalized to unit
area, in Fig. 2 for 44 < pγ
T < 50 GeV. The output is
compared to photon signal events and dijet background
events simulated using pythia. The signal events may
contain photons originated from in the parton-to-photon
fragmenation process. For this reason, the background
events, produced with QCD processes in pythia, were
preselected to exclude the bremsstrahlung photons pro-
duced from partons. Signal and background MC events
were processed through a geant-based [28] simulation of
the D0 detector and the same reconstruction code as used
for the data. The ANN is tested using electrons from

performed in bins of pγ
T (with pγ
T > 30 GeV) and only
information on the the jet angular direction is used.
Z boson decays and the resulting normalized data and
MC distributions are compared in Fig. 3. Photon candi-
dates are selected by the requirement ONN > 0.7 which
has good background rejection and a signal eﬃciency in
the range (93–97)%. The signal selection eﬃciency de-
creases by about 4% with increasing pγ
T from 30 GeV to
300 GeV due to the ONN > 0.7 requirement. The to-
tal photon+jet selection eﬃciency after applying all the
selection criteria, including the ANN and the ̸ET require-
ments, is (63–77)% as a function of pγ
T with an overall
systematic uncertainty of (4.7–5.2)%. Main sources of
ineﬃciency are the isolation, anti-track matching, ANN,
and the photon vertex pointing cuts.
Events containing at least one hadronic jet are selected.
Jets are reconstructed using the D0 Run II jet-ﬁnding al-
gorithm with a cone of radius 0.7 [29], and are required to
satisfy quality criteria which suppress background from
leptons, photons, and detector noise eﬀects. Jet energies
are corrected to the particle level. The leading jet should
have pjet
T >15 GeV and |yjet|<0.8 or 1.5<|yjet|<2.5. The
leading photon candidate and the leading jet are also re-
quired to be separated in η−φ space by ∆R(γ, jet) > 0.7.
The leading jet total selection eﬃciency varies from 94%
to almost 100% and takes into account any migrations
between leading and second jet from the particle to the
reconstruction level.
The total systematic uncertainty
on this eﬃciency is 5.7% at pγ
T ≃ 30
GeV, decreasing
to about 2% at pγ
T ≥ 200 GeV. The measurement is not
In total, about 1.4 million candidate events are selected
after application of all selection criteria. A correction for
the “γ+jet” event purity P is then applied to account for
the remaining background in the region ONN > 0.7. The
distribution of the ANN output for the simulated pho-
ton signal and dijet background samples are ﬁtted to the
data for each pγ
T bin using a maximum likelihood ﬁt [30]
to obtain the fractions of signal and background com-
ponents in the data without constraining the fractions of
signal and background samples in the ﬁt to be in the [0, 1]
range. The data and ﬁtted sum of the weighted signal
and background MC distributions of ONN are found to
be compatible with χ2/ndf values in the range 0.2–1.3
[31]. The resulting purities are shown in Fig. 4 for each
measurement region. The pγ
T dependence of the purity
is ﬁtted in each region using a two parameter function
P = 1 − exp(a + bpγ
T). The result of the ﬁts together
with their statistical errors are shown in Fig. 4.
The
systematic uncertainties on the ﬁt are estimated using
alternative ﬁtting functions and varying the number of
bins in the ﬁtting of the ANN output distribution. An
additional systematic uncertainty due to the fragmen-
tation model implemented in pythia is also taken into
account. It is found to be 5% at pγ
T ≃ 30 GeV, 2% at
pγ
T ≃ 50 GeV, and 1% at pγ
T ≳ 70 GeV [10].

To study whether bremsstrahlung photons have dif-
ferent selection eﬃciencies from direct photons, we ex-
tracted them from dijet events simulated with pythia.
We found that they do not produce a noticeable change
of the selection eﬃciencies, acceptance and shape of the
photon ANN output that have been obtained with direct
photons.
The diﬀerential cross section d3σ/dpγ
T dyγdyjet for the
process p¯p → γ + jet + X is obtained from the num-
ber of data events in each interval, after applying correc-
tions for background, eﬃciency, and acceptance eﬀects,
divided by the integrated luminosity and the widths of
the interval in the photon transverse momentum, photon
rapidity, and jet rapidity. The data are also corrected for
pT bin-migration eﬀects which result from the ﬁnite en-
ergy resolution of the EM calorimeter using an analytical
Ansatz method [33] and the measured EM energy resolu-
tion determined from the Z boson peak. The correction
factors range from (1–5)% with about a 1% uncertainty.
The total (δσexp
tot ) and main sources of experimental
systematic uncertainty are shown for the |yjet| < 0.8,
yγ ·yjet > 0 region in Fig. 5. Similar uncertainties are
found for the other measured regions. The largest uncer-
tainties are assigned to the purity estimation [(10–4)%],
photon and jet selections [(7.7–5.2)%], photon energy
scale [(4.2–6.0)%], and the integrated luminosity (6.1%).
The uncertainty ranges above are quoted with uncer-
tainty at low pγ
T ﬁrst and at high pγ
T second. The system-
atic uncertainty on the photon selection is due mainly to
the anti-track match cut (3%), a correction due to ob-
served data/MC diﬀerence in the eﬃciency of the main
photon selection criteria found from Z →ee events [(1.5–
2)%], the photon vertex pointing requirement (2%), the
ANN cut (2%), and the uncertainty on the parameterized
photon selection eﬃciency (<1%). The total experimen-
tal systematic uncertainty for each data point is obtained
by adding all the individual contributions in quadrature.
The result for each region is presented as a function

FIG. 7: The ratios of the measured triple-diﬀerential cross section, in each measured interval, to the NLO QCD prediction using
jetphox [36] with the CTEQ6.5M PDF set and all three scales µR,F,f = pγ
T f(y⋆). The solid vertical line on the points shows
the statistical and pT -dependent systematic uncertainties added in quadrature, while the internal line shows the statistical
uncertainty. The two dotted lines represent the eﬀect of varying the theoretical scales by a factor of two. The shaded region is
the CTEQ6.5M PDF uncertainty. The dashed and dash-dotted lines show ratios of the jetphox predictions with MRST 2004,
Alekhin, and ZEUS 2005 to CTEQ6.5M PDF sets. Systematic uncertainties have large (> 80%) pγ
T bin-to-bin correlations.
There is a common 7.8% normalization uncertainty that is not shown on the data points.
The data are compared to next-to-leading order (NLO)
QCD predictions obtained using jetphox [35, 36], with
CTEQ6.5M PDF [20] and BFG fragmentation func-
tions of partons to photons [37]. The renormalization,
factorization, and fragmentation scales (µR, µF , and
µf) are set equal to pγ
T f(y⋆), where f(y⋆) = {[1 +
exp(−2|y⋆|)]/2}1/2 and y⋆ = 0.5(yγ − yjet) [38].
The
theoretical predictions include selection criteria on the
photon and jet similar to those applied in the experi-
mental analysis. In particular, an isolation requirement
on the photon of [Etotal(R = 0.4) − Eγ]/Eγ < 0.07 is
made, where Etotal(R = 0.4) is the total energy around
the photon in a cone of radius R = 0.4, and Eγ is the
photon energy. This requirement suppresses the relative
contribution from photons produced in the fragmentation
process, and leads to a more consistent comparison with
the experimental result. Corrections for the underlying
event and parton-to-hadron fragmentation contributions,
estimated using pythia, are found to be negligibly small
and are not included. To make a more detailed compar-
ison, the ratio of the measured cross section to the NLO
QCD prediction is taken in each interval and the results
are shown in Fig. 7.
The inner error bars reﬂect the
statistical uncertainty only, and the outer error bars are
the total statistical and pT -dependent systematic uncer-
tainties summed in quadrature. Most of these systematic
uncertainties, associated with the parametrizations of the
photon and jet selection eﬃciencies, purity (including
the uncertainty from the pythia fragmentation model),
photon pT correction, and calorimeter energy scale, have
large (> 80%) bin-to-bin correlations in pγ
T . Systematic

in these pγ
T and rapidity regions are (1–1.5) δσtot outside
of the CTEQ6.5M PDF set uncertainty range which is
shown by the shaded region in the ﬁgure and calculated
according to the prescription in [20]. Note that the data-
to-theory ratios have a shape similar to those observed
in the inclusive photon cross sections measured by the
UA2 [7], CDF [8] and D0 [10] collaborations.
The dotted lines in Fig. 7 show the eﬀect of setting the
renormalization, factorization, and fragmentation scales
to 0.5pγ
Tf(y⋆) (upper dotted line) and 2pγ
Tf(y⋆) (lower
dotted line). The eﬀect on the normalization is (9–11)%,
except for jets in the 1.5 < |yjet| < 2.5, yγ ·yjet < 0 ra-
pidity range where it is (18–20)%. The scale variation
is not able to simultaneously accommodate the mea-
sured diﬀerential cross sections in all of the measured
regions. The ratios of the NLO QCD prediction with the
MRST 2004 [39], Alekhin [40], and ZEUS 2005 [41] PDF
sets to the prediction obtained using the CTEQ6.5M
PDF set are also presented in the ﬁgure.
The shapes
of the predictions are very similar, especially for forward
jet production, with the diﬀerent PDF sets.
The ratios of the predicted cross sections with the de-
fault scales [µR = µF = µf = pγ
T f(y⋆)] to those with all
the scales set equal to pγ
T are presented for each of the
four kinematic regions as a function of pγ
T in Fig. 8. For
each measured region, the new prediction is smaller than
the default case across the entire pγ
T range, most notably
in the forward jet rapidity intervals where this choice of
scale leads to a poorer level of agreement between data
and theory.
Uncertainties related to the photon production due to
the fragmentation mechanism are also studied separately
using the jetphox package. The ratio of the p¯p → γ +
jet + X cross section for the direct photon contribution
to the sum of direct and fragmentation contributions is
shown, for the chosen photon isolation criteria, in each
of the four measured regions in Fig. 9. For all regions,
the fragmentation contribution decreases with increasing
pγ
T [35, 42, 43] and is largest for the 1.5 < |yjet| < 2.5,
yγ · yjet < 0 region.
A variation in the fragmentation
scale by a factor of four leads to only a (2–3)% change
in the total predicted cross section. Similarly a change
in default set of fragmentation functions (BFG Set 1 to
BFG Set 2) results in a cross section change of ≲ 1%.
A possible contribution to the theoretical cross section
from threshold resummation has been estimated [44] for
inclusive direct photon production at the Tevatron and
found to be ≲ (2.5 − 3.0)% for pγ
T ≲ 350 GeV.
The experimental systematic uncertainties are reduced
further by measuring the ratios between the diﬀeren-
tial cross sections D = d3σ/dpγ
T dyγdyjet in the diﬀer-
ent regions.
Most of the systematic uncertainties re-
lated to the identiﬁcation of central photons then cancel,
and only systematic uncertainties related to the p¯p →
γ + jet + X event purities and the jet selection eﬃciency
(when measuring ratios between central and forward jet

regions) remain. Measured ratios between the diﬀeren-
tial cross sections in the diﬀerent regions are presented in
Fig. 10 and Tables V–X. The overall experimental uncer-
tainty is largest in the ﬁrst and last pγ
T bins and ranges
from (3–9)% across most of the pγ
T range. The NLO QCD
predicted cross section ratios estimated using jetphox
are also presented for scale choices µR,F,f = pγ
T f(y⋆),
µR,F,f = 0.5pγ
Tf(y⋆), and µR,F,f = 2pγ
T f(y⋆). The scale
uncertainty of the predicted ratios is ≤ 3% and about
(3.5–7.5)% for the ratio of cross sections in the two for-
ward jet rapidity intervals. The shapes of the measured
ratios between the cross sections in the diﬀerent regions,
in general, are qualitatively reproduced by the theory.
A quantitative diﬀerence, however, between theory and
the measurement is observed for the ratios of the central
jet regions to the forward 1.5 < |yjet| < 2.5, yγ ·yjet > 0
region, even after the theoretical scale variation is taken
into account. The ratio between the two forward jet cross
sections suggests a scale choice µR,F,f ≃ 2pγ
T f(y⋆). How-
ever, the ratios of the central jet regions to the forward
1.5<|yjet|<2.5, yγ ·yjet < 0 region suggest a theoretical
scale closer to µR,F,f ≃ 0.5pγ
Tf(y⋆).
In
summary,
the
diﬀerential
cross
section
d3σ/dpγ
T dyγdyjet for the process p¯p → γ + jet + X
is measured for central photons (|yγ| < 1.0) separately
for four diﬀerent rapidity conﬁgurations between the
leading photon and the leading jet. The data cover six
orders of magnitude in the cross section as a function of
pγ
T for events with jets in |yjet| < 0.8, and extend the
kinematic reach of previous photon plus jet measure-
ments. Next-to-leading order QCD predictions, using a
few diﬀerent modern parameterizations of parton dis-
tribution functions, are unable to describe the shape of
the pγ
T dependence of the cross section across the entire
measured range.
Similarly, theoretical scale variations
are unable to simultaneously describe the data-to-theory
ratios in each of the four measured regions.
Thus,
