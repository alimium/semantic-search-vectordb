Federal Aviation Administration
14 CFR Part 71
[Airspace Docket No. 01–AEA–17]
Establishment of Class E Airspace;
Sharon, PA
AGENCY: Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA), DOT.
ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking.
The FAA is considering an
amendment to Part 71 of the Federal
Aviation Regulations (14 CFR Part 71) to
establish Class E airspace area at
Sharon, PA. An RNAV Approach,
Helicopter RNAV 262, has been
developed for Shenango-UMPC Horizon
Hospital Heliport, Sharon, PA.
Controlled airspace extending upward
from 700 feet AGL is needed to
accommodate the SIAP. Class E airspace
designations for airspace areas
extending upward from 700 feet or more
above the surface are published in
Paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9H,
dated September 1, 2000, and effective
September 16, 2000, which is
incorporated by reference in 14 CFR
71.1. The Class E airspace designation
listed in this document would be
published subsequently in the Order.
The FAA has determined that this
proposed regulation only involves an
established body of technical
regulations for which frequent and
routine amendments are necessary to
keep them operationally current.
Therefore, this proposed regulation—(1)
is not a ‘‘significant regulatory action’’
under Executive order 12866; (2) is not
a ‘‘significant rule’’ under DOT
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3)
does not warrant preparation of a
regulatory evaluation as the anticipated
impact is so minimal. Since this is a
routine matter that would only affect air
traffic procedures and air navigation, it
is certified that this proposed rule
would not have significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the
Regulatory Flexibility Act.

Airspace, Incorporation by reference,
Navigation (air).
Comments Invited
Interested parties are invited to
participate in this proposed rulemaking
by submitting such written data, views,
or arguments as they may desire.
Comments that provide the factual basis
supporting the views and suggestions
presented are particularly helpful in
developing reasoned regulatory
decisions on the proposal. Comments
are specifically invited on the overall
regulatory, economic, environmental,
and energy-related aspects of the
proposal. Communications should
identify the airspace docket number and
be submitted in triplicate to the address
listed above. Commenters wishing the
FAA to acknowledge receipt of their
comments on this notice must submit
with those comments a self-addressed,
stamped postcard on which the
following statement is made:
‘‘Comments to Airspace Docket No. 01–
AEA–17’’. The postcard will be date/
time stamped and returned to the
commenter. All communications
received on or before the closing date
for comments will be considered before
taking action on the proposed rule. The
proposal contained in this notice may
be changed in light of comments
received. All comments submitted will
be available for examination in the
Rules Docket closing both before and
after the closing date for comments. A

commercial operators; and, idling limits
for gasoline and diesel-powered engines
in heavy-duty motor vehicles) to the 30
