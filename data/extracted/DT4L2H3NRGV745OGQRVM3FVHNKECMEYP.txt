Respondent 
 
 
Petition for Review of an Order of the 
Board of Immigration Appeals 
BIA No. A075 854 677 
 
 
Before JOLLY, HIGGINBOTHAM, and HIGGINSON, Circuit Judges. 
Stephen A. Higginson, Circuit Judge:* 
 
Ifeyhewen Badidi petitions for review of a dismissal by the Board of 
Immigration Appeals (BIA) of his appeal of an order of removal and the denial 
of his motion for continuance.  Badidi challenges the determination that he 
was removable based upon Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) 
§ 237(a)(1)(D)(i) (8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(D)(i)), as an alien who had his 
permanent resident status on a conditional basis terminated.  He also contends 
                                         
* Pursuant to 5TH CIR. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not 
be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5TH 
CIR. R. 47.5.4.

that the denial of his motion for continuance was an abuse of discretion by the 
BIA and Immigration Judge (IJ).  The Respondent has filed a motion for 
dismissal for lack of jurisdiction—claiming the petition was untimely—and, 
alternatively, for summary denial. 
 
The Respondent contends that this court lacks jurisdiction over this 
petition for review because it was not timely filed.  A timely petition for review 
is a jurisdictional requirement.  Navarro-Miranda v. Ashcroft, 330 F.3d 672, 
676 (5th Cir. 2003).  The BIA’s final order is dated January 27, 2014.  Badidi’s 
petition was therefore due by February 26, 2014, see 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(1), but 
was received by this court on February 28, 2014.  For petitioners such as Badidi 
who are detained at the time of filing, pleadings are considered “timely if 
deposited in the institution’s internal mailing system on or before the last day 
for filing.”  FED. R. APP. P. 25(a)(2)(C); Marmorato v. Holder, 376 F. App’x 380, 
382 n.1 (5th Cir. 2010) (applying the mailbox rule to filings by a detained alien).  
Because Badidi’s petition was filed within two business days of the due date, 
this court will presume, pursuant to the prison mailbox rule, that the pleading 
was timely deposited in the prison mail system.  See, e.g., United States v. 
Young, 966 F.2d 164, 165 (5th Cir. 1992) (presuming notice of appeal was 
timely mailed when received two days late); Marmorato, 376 F. App’x at 382 
n.1. 
 
Although we reject Respondent’s argument that the petition was not 
timely filed, we lack jurisdiction to consider Badidi’s claims regarding the 
determination that he is removable under INA § 237(a)(1)(D)(i) (8 U.S.C. § 
1227(a)(1)(D)(i)).  In this immigration proceeding, Badidi took two appeals to 
the BIA.  In neither appeal did Badidi present to the BIA the arguments that 
he now presents to this court: (1) that improper procedures were followed when 
his conditional resident status was terminated; and (2) that the IJ did not

No. 14-60155 
develop the record and adjudicate his I-751 petition to remove conditions on 
residence.  He therefore failed to administratively exhaust his challenge to the 
removal order and this court thus lacks jurisdiction to consider it.  See 
§ 1252(d)(1); Roy v. Ashcroft, 389 F.3d 132, 137 (5th Cir. 2004) (“An alien fails 
to exhaust his administrative remedies with respect to an issue when the issue 
is not raised in the first instance before the BIA.”). 
We reach the merits of Badidi’s claim that the BIA erred in denying his 
request for a continuance pending the appeal of the denial of his I-130 petition.  
The BIA determined that the IJ had properly denied Badidi’s continuance 
request, given that the United States Citizenship and Immigration Service had 
denied the I-130 petition.  This determination is in accord with the record, 
which indicates that the I-130 petition was denied due to numerous 
discrepancies in the couple’s answers to questions designed to establish the 
authenticity of their marriage.  Badidi’s conclusory assertions regarding this 
issue do not establish a likelihood of success in challenging USCIS’s 
determination, or that the denial of a continuance was an abuse of discretion.  
See, e.g., Ahmed v. Gonzales, 447 F.3d 433, 438-39 n.3 (5th Cir. 2006); Matter 
of Hashmi, 24 I & N. Dec. 785, 790 (BIA 2009) (listing factors to be considered 
in assessing whether to grant a continuance due to a pending petition). 
 
Badidi’s petition for review is DISMISSED, in part, for lack of 
jurisdiction and DENIED, in part.  The Respondent’s motion is DENIED.
