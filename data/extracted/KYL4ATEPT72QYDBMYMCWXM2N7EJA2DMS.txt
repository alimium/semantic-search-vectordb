DECISION
MlU-Base Industries, Inc. protests the award of a contract to A.I.W, Alton by the.
Defense General Supply Center, Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), under solicitation
No. SP0440-94-R-1128. MU-Base challenges the determination that A.I.W. Alton is a
responsible contractor.
We dismiss the protest.
A determination that a bidder or 6f.eror is capable of perforning a contract is
based, in large measure, on subjective Judgments which gederally are not
susceptible to'reasoned review, Whether the'awaidee had the ability and intention
of complying with the requirements Is slnipl'y a matter for thedcontracting officer, in
the exercise of her discretionary business Jildgthent, to consider in making the
respai&f.it.. 
detetrdna tion. An agency's atftiuiative determinztion of a
contracto ds respofsibiliy:Y illnot be reviewed by our Office absent a showing of
possible 
1ud or bad faith' on the part of proclirement officials, or that definitive
responsibity cuiteri& in the solicitation may haye been misap'plied. 4 C.F.R.

Base alleges that a more thorough investigation or pte-award survey would have
shown that A.I.W. Alton was not responsible, thai, even if true. does not establish
that the agency may have acted fraudulUntly or in bad faith. It Is simply' up to the
agency, which must bear the burden of deficient contract performance, to decide
what is necessary in order to determine if a bidder or offeror Is capable of
performing the contract. DLA's approach--which did not include a pre-award
survey-therefore is a permissible one and provides no basis for our review of this
muatter.
