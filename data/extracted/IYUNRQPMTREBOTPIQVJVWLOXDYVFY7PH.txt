Survey of International Air Travelers
The Survey of International Air Travelers provides a level of detail and insight into the traveler charac-
teristics and travel patterns of international visitors to and from the United States not found elsewhere. 
Responses are weighted with data from the Department of Homeland Security and the following thirty-
five tables are then populated. This report, which was constructed using just a fraction of the data available, 
summarizes what we know about the overseas business traveler who visits the United States.
