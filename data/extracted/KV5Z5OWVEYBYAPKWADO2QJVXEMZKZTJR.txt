Four Selected States Expanded Access 
by Relying on Schools and Existing 
Providers of Early Education and Care to 
Provide Services  
The expanded prekindergarten programs in Georgia, Oklahoma, New York, 
and New Jersey had some similarities in their design features. For instance, 
programs were offered at no direct cost to parents, regardless of family 
income, and each state incorporated some level of collaboration with 
community-based providers such as Head Start and large child care facilities. 
Some key differences in their design features also existed. For example, 
Georgia and Oklahoma had statewide programs providing prekindergarten 
services to over half of their four-year olds, while New York’s and New 
Jersey’s programs were more geographically targeted. States and school 
districts also varied in offering full- or half-day prekindergarten programs. 
States also varied in teacher qualifications, the percentage of 
prekindergarten children served by community-based providers, funding 
methods, and in the amount of funding per child.

For nearly 40 years, the federal 
government has played a role in 
providing early childhood 
development programs for children 
of low-income families through 
Head Start and other programs. 
Since 1980, the number of states 
with preschool programs has also 
significantly increased. While most 
of these programs have targeted 
children at risk of school failure, 
more recently, interest has grown 
in expanding these limited 
programs because of the growing 
concern about children’s readiness 
for school and subsequent 
achievement. It has also been 
fueled by new research on early 
brain development that suggests 
the importance of early education 
and by the high rate of mothers in 
the workforce and their need for 
early childhood services. In this 
context, questions have arisen 
about how the various programs 
are coordinated and what lessons 
have been learned from broad-
based state preschool efforts. 
 
This work focused on four states 
that have expanded their preschool 
programs to serve more children. 
In these states, GAO addressed (1) 
how prekindergarten programs 
were designed and funded, (2) the 
potential implications of these 
program features for children’s 
participation and other programs 
that serve four year-olds, and (3) 
the outcome data that have been 
collected on participating children 
and families. To gather this 
information, GAO conducted site 
visits in four states—Georgia, New 
Jersey, New York, and Oklahoma.

Some program features had potential implications for the participation of 
children and for early childhood programs. For example, none of the four 
states required providers to transport all children to and from 
prekindergarten, and many children were enrolled in half-day programs, 
which officials believed might have limited the participation of children from 
low-income and working families. Collaborations between programs and 
community-based organizations generally permitted rapid program 
expansion and were viewed as beneficial to early childhood programs. 
Finally, we found few data to determine the impact of state prekindergarten 
expansion on the availability or prices of child care. 
 
While some data were available on outcomes for children who participated 
in prekindergarten programs, less was known about their impacts on 
families. For example, a study in Oklahoma showed that children who 
participated made significant gains on several school readiness measures 
relative to a comparison group of unenrolled children. However, none of the 
four states had measured effects on families, such as parents’ work effort.

For nearly 40 years, the federal government has played a role in providing 
early childhood development programs for children of low-income 
families through Head Start and other programs. Prior to 1970, only a few 
states had prekindergarten programs, and these were mostly available to a 
small number of children and targeted specific populations such as 
disadvantaged children, those at risk of school failure, or those with 
special needs. More recently, there has been interest in expanding these 
limited prekindergarten programs because of the growing concern about 
children’s readiness for school and subsequent achievement. This interest 
has also been fueled by advances in early brain development research that 
suggest the importance of early education and by the high rate of mothers 
in the workforce and their need for early childhood services. During the 
2001-02 school year, about 40 states enrolled approximately 700,000 of the 
nation’s 7.8 million three- and four-year-olds in prekindergarten programs, 
and spent over $2.4 billion to finance these programs. A few of these states 
have invested significant resources to expand enrollments of 
prekindergarten programs beyond targeted populations. They have also 
used federal funds such as Title I of the Elementary and Secondary 
Education Act, as amended by the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, and 
Individuals with Disabilities Education Act to support prekindergarten 
programs, and have implemented these programs in a variety of settings 
such as child care centers and Head Start agencies, as well as public 
schools. 
Page 1 
GAO-04-852  State Prekindergarten Programs 
 
 
 
Given the level of investment and the variety of preschool programs 
currently receiving federal and state support, there is concern about 
whether these programs are well coordinated and that lessons from 
implementing broadly based state programs are documented. Accordingly, 
you asked that we review programs in selected states that expanded their 
prekindergarten efforts. This report presents information on (1) how state 
prekindergarten programs were designed and funded in these states,  
(2) the potential implications of these program features for children’s 
participation and for other programs that serve four-year-olds, and (3) the 
outcome data that have been collected on participating children and 
families. 
To determine how prekindergarten programs were designed, we reviewed 
program information and interviewed state officials, local education 
program officials, as well as numerous Head Start grantees and directors 
of large child care facilities, during site visits to four states (Georgia, New 
Jersey, New York, and Oklahoma). These states were selected, in part, 
because they were among a small subset of states that had expanded their 
prekindergarten programs and aimed to serve all four-year-olds whose 
parents wanted them to attend, regardless of family income. We also 
considered states that had well-established prekindergarten programs. 
Because New Jersey had two major preschool programs, including the 
court-ordered Abbott program that was implemented in New Jersey’s 30 
highest-poverty school districts, we report on a total of five 
prekindergarten programs in four states. 
To identify potential implications of the design of state prekindergarten 
programs, we interviewed (1) state and local education agency officials; 
(2) providers of prekindergarten services at community-based 
organizations; and (3) federal, state, and local Head Start program staff. 
We also reviewed selected data on child care availability in these states 
and the nation. We assessed the data for reliability and reasonableness and 
found them to be sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report. To 
determine what outcome data have been collected on participating 
children and families, we interviewed state and local education agency 
officials in each of the four states we visited, contacted researchers, and 
reviewed two studies—a study of a school district in Oklahoma and one 
statewide study in Georgia. We assessed the methodologies used in these 
studies and determined that the methodologies were of sufficient quality 
for use in discussion of most study findings, and we limited our discussion 
to these findings. (App. I contains a more detailed discussion of our scope 
and methodology.) We conducted our work between October 2003 and 
Page 2

August 2004 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing 
standards. 
Results in Brief 
The four states we visited had developed expanded prekindergarten 
programs that varied in design features and funding. The four states’ 
program features were similar in that each offered services at no direct 
costs to parents and emphasized preparing children for school and 
preventing failure in early grades. They also afforded the option of 
collaboration with community-based providers. We found significant 
differences in other aspects of the programs, such as geographic coverage, 
requirements for teachers, and extent of reliance on community-based 
providers of early childhood education. For example, Georgia had a 
statewide program that was implemented in all of its school districts, 
while New Jersey targeted its two prekindergarten programs in high-
poverty areas—covering about 24 percent of its school districts. Teacher 
qualifications also varied among the four states. Requirements for lead 
teachers ranged from an associate’s degree to a bachelor’s degree with 
certification in early childhood education. In providing their 
prekindergarten programs, states and school districts also differed in the 
degree and type of collaborations they established with community-based 
providers such as Head Start and private child care centers. In terms of 
funding, the four states relied primarily on state resources but differed in 
funding methods and amounts per child. For example, New York financed 
its program using general revenues, while Georgia relied on proceeds from 
a state lottery. With regard to funding levels, New Jersey had the highest 
funding per child for its Abbott prekindergarten—over $9,500 compared 
with less than $4,200 for each of the other programs during the 2002-03 
school year. All four states generally used relatively small amounts of 
federal funds, such as those from Title I or the Individuals with Disabilities 
Education Act, to support their prekindergarten programs. 
Some design features of state prekindergarten programs had potential 
implications for children and early childhood programs in the four states 
we visited. For example, both local officials and providers told us that the 
lack of transportation and half-day programs may have affected 
participation in prekindergarten programs for children of low-income and 
working families. None of the four states we visited required 
prekindergarten providers to transport all participating children. 
Regarding the implications of state prekindergarten programs for other 
early childhood program providers, three of the five programs served most 
prekindergarten children through community-based organizations such as 
Head Start and child care centers. State and local officials and community-
based providers told us that collaborations were beneficial to their 
Page 3 
GAO-04-852  State Prekindergarten Programs 
 
 
 
programs, but they also identified some challenges. In terms of benefits, 
some states used collaborations to quickly expand their prekindergarten 
programs by using existing age-appropriate facilities. In addition, 
collaborations increased access to school district resources for some 
community-based organizations. Some Head Start grantees received state 
funds to provide prekindergarten services, while other grantees told us 
they had begun serving more three-year-olds to offset the loss of four-year-
olds who participated in state prekindergarten programs elsewhere, which 
potentially increased the number of poor children with 2 years of 
preschool education. At the same time, challenges remained for some 
states and school districts—including the lack of expertise in arranging 
formal contracts and maintaining effective collaborations with 
community-based providers. Little empirical data were available to 
determine the degree to which these broad-based state prekindergarten 
programs affected the availability of and prices for child care, and the 
anecdotal evidence we collected was mixed. 
Some data have been collected on outcomes for participating children, but 
little is known about outcomes for their families. In the school districts we 
visited, we found that assessments of children’s development were 
incorporated in the curriculum and used to provide information to parents. 
We also found two studies that provided information about the 
educational outcomes of state prekindergarten programs in Oklahoma and 
Georgia. A study conducted by Georgetown University collected data on 
prekindergarten children in the Tulsa, Oklahoma, school district and found 
that children who participated in the Tulsa program had significantly 
higher scores on several school readiness measures than similar children 
in the comparison group, who did not participate in the Tulsa 
prekindergarten program. A second study, conducted by Georgia State 
University on Georgia’s prekindergarten program, reported that children 
who participated in the state program made significant gains on several 
school readiness measures, including language and problem solving, as did 
children in Head Start and those enrolled in private prekindergarten 
programs. None of the four states we visited reported collecting 
information regarding the impact of their programs on families with 
respect to issues such as workforce participation. 
Background 
 
The growth in state prekindergarten programs has occurred for various 
reasons, but three frequently cited reasons are (1) evidence of the 
importance of early childhood to later development, (2) the high rate of 
labor force participation by mothers of young children, and (3) increased 
concern over school readiness and subsequent achievement. Much has 
Page 4 
GAO-04-852  State Prekindergarten Programs 
 
 
 
been discovered about children’s ability to learn more at an earlier age 
than previously believed. The early childhood years are commonly 
portrayed as formative. Between the first day of life and the first day of 
kindergarten, development proceeds at a pace exceeding that of any 
subsequent stage of life. Children from birth to age five engage in making 
sense of the world on many levels: language, human interactions, counting 
and quantification, spatial reasoning, physical causality, problem solving, 
and categorization.
1 
Since the 1960s, the percentage of women in the labor force has increased 
dramatically. In 1960, about 36 percent of women participated in the labor 
force, and by 2000 this figure had increased to 58 percent. Moreover, in 
2003, about 69 percent of women with children aged three to five (but 
none younger) were in the labor force. This high rate of participation of 
women in the labor force has resulted in more children enrolled in 
preschool programs of varying quality and pressure being placed on 
schools to provide before- and after-school programs. 
To improve educational achievement for all children and reduce failure in 
lower grades, many states and school districts are placing a greater 
emphasis on the school readiness of younger children. For nearly a quarter 
century, many states have developed or expanded their investment in 
prekindergarten programs to increase the likelihood of children’s success 
in school. Prior to 1970 only 7 states funded preschool programs, and by 
1988, 28 states had programs and total spending was $190 million;
2 such 
programs generally targeted economically and educationally 
disadvantaged children. While most state-sponsored prekindergarten 
programs continue to serve such children, a few states are in the process 
of expanding their programs to include all four-year-olds, regardless of 
family income. According to the National Institute for Early Education 
Research (NIEER), 40 states (and Washington, D.C.) had some form of 
state-sponsored prekindergarten program in the 2001-02 school year and

enrolled over 700,000 children, mostly four-year-olds.
3 While states spent 
more than $2.4 billion for prekindergarten during the 2001-02 school year, 
10 states accounted for over 80 percent of this amount. 
Generally, prekindergarten programs aimed to serve four-year-olds, but 
according to NIEER estimates, most states served less than one-fifth of all 
their four-year-olds (see fig. 1). NIEER estimated that about 80 percent of 
children served by state prekindergarten programs were four-year-olds.
4 
During the 2001-02 school year, only two states (Georgia and Oklahoma) 
enrolled more than 50 percent of their four-year-olds in a state-sponsored 
prekindergarten program. Ten states (Alaska, Idaho, Indiana, Mississippi, 
Montana, New Hampshire, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, and 
Wyoming) had not initiated prekindergarten programs.

a NIEER identified 10 program characteristics and developed benchmarks for each of the 
characteristics. The other program characteristics were teacher specialized training requirements, 
assistant teacher degree requirements, teacher in-service requirements, screening/referral 
requirements, and meal requirements. 
b Based on NIEER’s summary of quality standards for a total of 44 programs, including some states 
with more than one prekindergarten program, and Washington, D.C. 
 
Among the 10 largest state prekindergarten programs, most met the 
benchmarks for class size, family support services, staff-child ratio, and 
teacher qualifications, and they were equally divided with respect to 
comprehensive curriculum standards. 
State-sponsored prekindergarten programs are expanding alongside 
existing programs for young children, including Head Start, Title I, and 
private child care programs. Head Start is a targeted program that mostly 
serves children from low-income families.
5 Head Start, administered at the 
                                                                                                                                    
5Created in 1965, Head Start is the largest federal program that supports early childhood 
education and was designed to help break the cycle of poverty by providing comprehensive 
educational, social, health, nutritional, and psychological services to low-income children.  
Page 8

federal level by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), is 
implemented in local communities through grantees. These grantees 
include community action agencies, school systems, for-profit and 
nonprofit organizations, other government agencies, and tribal 
governments or associations. The Department of Health and Human 
Services reported that Head Start served just over 900,000 children 
nationwide during the 2003 fiscal year, and most were aged three and four; 
Head Start was funded at about $6.7 billion, or about $7,366 per child. 
In addition to administering Head Start, the federal government also 
provides some limited support for early education programs through Title 
I. Administered by the Department of Education (Education), Title I is the 
single largest federal investment for elementary and secondary education.
6 
Its primary purpose is to help local education agencies and schools 
improve the teaching and learning of children who are failing, or are most 
at risk of failing, to meet challenging academic standards. In support of 
that goal, Education reported that Title I was funded at about $11.7 billion 
during the 2003 fiscal year. Nearly 15 million students were supported by 
Title I funds, and of these, about 2 percent (an estimated 313,000) were 
enrolled in prekindergarten programs during the 1999-2000 school year.
7 
The Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF) is the principal federal 
program that supports child care for low-income families. CCDF is 
administered by HHS, and each state receives an annual allocation that is 
used to subsidize the child care expenses of low-income families with 
children generally under age 13. CCDF subsidies can be used to obtain 
child care from various types of providers, including child care centers 
                                                                                                                                    
6Education also funds two other smaller early childhood education-related initiatives. The 
Even Start program was designed to improve family literacy and educational opportunities. 
The program is generally targeted to parents who are not enrolled in school and their 
children through age seven, who lack a high school diploma or its equivalent; the basic 
skills necessary to function in society; or are unable to speak, read, or write English. In 
program year 2000, Even Start served about 31,600 families and 41,600 children; in 2002, 
Even Start was funded at $250 million. Early Reading First is a competitive grant program 
to support local efforts to enhance the early language, literacy, and prereading 
development of preschool age children, particularly those from low-income families, 
through strategies and professional development that are based on scientifically based 
reading research. In fiscal year 2003, nearly $75 million was awarded to 30 grantees.

8 In fiscal year 2002, CCDF was appropriated nearly $5 
billion, and HHS reported that about 1.8 million children received 
subsidies in an average month. As a condition of receiving CCDF funds, 
states must conduct biennial surveys of child care providers, which are 
considered by states when establishing reimbursement rates for providers 
serving subsidized children. In addition to information regarding the fees 
charged by providers for child care services, such surveys may provide 
states with information about the type of child care they provide, 
qualifications of the staff, the age groups of the children they serve, and 
where they are located. 
Four Selected States 
Varied In the Design 
and Funding of their 
Expanded 
Prekindergarten 
Programs 
 
The four states we visited varied in the design features and funding of their 
prekindergarten programs. Programs shared similar features such as 
voluntary enrollment of children at no direct cost to their parents, but 
differed in others. In addition, all five state programs permitted 
collaboration with community-based providers. States varied in features 
such as the teacher requirements for their prekindergarten programs. 
States and school districts also differed in the degree and type of 
collaborations they established with community-based agencies. Finally, 
while states relied primarily on state resources, they reported some 
differences in funding mechanisms and per child funding levels. 
Selected States Designed 
Expanded Prekindergarten 
Programs to Enroll 
Children Voluntarily at No 
Direct Cost to Parents, but 
Differed in Geographic 
Breadth and Other Key 
Features 
 
In the four states visited—Georgia, New Jersey, New York, and 
Oklahoma—we found some similarities in prekindergarten programs.
9 
Over the last few years, all four states had expanded their state-sponsored 
prekindergarten programs and, as reported by NIEER in February 2004, 
were among only nine states and Washington, D.C., that provided 
prekindergarten services to more than 20 percent of their four-year-olds. 
All four states’ prekindergarten programs were provided at no direct cost 
to parents—regardless of family income—and were offered on a voluntary 
basis; children’s enrollment was not mandatory. In addition, each program 
emphasized preparation for school and incorporated the delivery of 
                                                                                                                                    
8Child care centers typically provide for 12 or more children in a nonresidential facility; 
family homes generally provide child care for a small group of children in a provider’s 
home. 
9New York has two prekindergarten programs: the targeted prekindergarten (TPK) and the 
universal prekindergarten (UPK). During the 2002-03 school year, the TPK program served 
about 5 percent of the state’s four-year-olds. This report focuses only on the state’s UPK 
initiative that served about 23 percent of the state’s four-year-olds.

prekindergarten services by community-based organizations as well as 
schools. None of the states required that all providers offer transportation 
services, although some providers did, and one state offered 
reimbursement for some children when this occurred.

estimated number of age-eligible children in the state, and the number of 
age-eligible children participating in prekindergarten and Head Start 
programs in the four states we visited.

10As a result of a state supreme court decision, the Abbott school districts were required to 
provide transportation to children, if needed. 
11The numbers of children who participated in state-sponsored prekindergarten and Head 
Start are not mutually exclusive, that is, an unknown number of children participated in 
both programs. Participation data for Head Start refer to funded enrollment levels.

Note: With the exception of New Jersey, this analysis is based on four-year-olds. In New Jersey, 
three- and four-year-olds were eligible in some districts. Also, New York’s prekindergarten program 
enrollment does not include children participating in the targeted prekindergarten program. 
 
The states we visited differed in the extent of geographic coverage and 
participation in prekindergarten programs. Three of the four states—
Georgia, New York, and Oklahoma—aimed to provide prekindergarten 
programs to all four-year-olds in the state whose parents wanted them to 
attend. While none of these states provided prekindergarten to all four-
year-olds, Oklahoma and Georgia had the most widespread programs. 
During the 2003-04 school year, Oklahoma provided prekindergarten in 
509 of its 541 school districts to about 63 percent of its four-year-olds; 
Georgia provided prekindergarten in all of its 181 school districts and to 
about 55 percent of its four-year-olds. New York initially implemented 
much of its universal prekindergarten program in school districts located 
Page 12 
GAO-04-852  State Prekindergarten Programs 
 
 
 
in the five largest cities in the state—Buffalo, New York City, Rochester, 
Syracuse, and Yonkers. During the 2003-04 school year, about 80 percent 
of the participating children attended prekindergarten in one of these five 
cities. Overall, New York’s prekindergarten program was offered in 190 of 
its 680 school districts. In New Jersey’s Abbott program, the state was 
court ordered to provide prekindergarten to all three- and four-year-olds 
who resided in the state’s 30 highest-poverty school districts. In addition, 
102 non-Abbott early childhood program aid (ECPA) school districts in 
high-poverty areas received funds for prekindergarten programs. 
Combined, these two programs provided prekindergarten in 132 of 539 (24 
percent) school districts in New Jersey. Table 2 provides information on 
the extent of geographic coverage and percentage of age-eligible children 
participating in prekindergarten programs in the four states we visited.

aPercentage of age-eligible children participating in prekindergarten was calculated by dividing the 
number of children in prekindergarten by the number of children residing in eligible school districts. In 
Georgia and Oklahoma, all school districts were eligible for the state prekindergarten program. In 
New York, 224 of the state’s 680 school districts were eligible for UPK funds. In New Jersey, 30 
school districts were eligible for the Abbott program. In addition, 102 non-Abbott high-poverty school 
districts in New Jersey were eligible for non-Abbott ECPA prekindergarten programs. 
bThis table does not include four-year-olds served in New York’s targeted prekindergarten program, 
which served about 5 percent of the state’s four-year-olds. 
 
Page 13 
GAO-04-852  State Prekindergarten Programs 
 
 
 
The state-sponsored prekindergarten programs also differed in some of 
their key design features. For example, the length of the program, in terms 
of hours per day, ranged from 2.5 hours to 6.5 hours per day among the 
four states. Full-day prekindergarten was provided in Georgia and New 
Jersey’s Abbott prekindergarten programs.
12 The other three 
prekindergarten programs—New Jersey’s non-Abbott ECPA, New York, 
and Oklahoma—allowed school districts to determine whether to offer 
full-day or half-day programs. 
The states also varied in their requirements for lead teachers, and two of 
the five state programs (New Jersey’s Abbott and Oklahoma) required 
teachers to be certified in early childhood education.
13 In New Jersey’s 
non-Abbott ECPA program, prekindergarten teachers could also hold 
certification in elementary education. Beginning with the 2004-05 school 
year, New York’s state program required that all prekindergarten teachers 
be certified, but certification could be in an area other than early 
childhood education. In Georgia, lead teachers were required to hold at 
least a technical diploma or degree, associate’s degree, or Montessori 
diploma. However, most lead teachers had at least a four-year-college 
degree. As of May 2004, the Georgia Department of Early Care and 
Learning reported that about 58 percent of its prekindergarten teachers 
were certified in early childhood or elementary education and 21 percent 
                                                                                                                                    
12The Georgia Department of Early Care and Learning also offered a resource coordination 
grant program that was available to eligible prekindergarten providers on a competitive 
basis so that they could provide supportive services to children and their families in 
addition to educational services. The key focus of the resource coordinator was to involve 
parents in their child’s educational development process by, among other things, helping 
parents obtain needed health services for their child and attending informational and child 
development seminars. Resource coordinators may also help parents obtain community 
resources such as information regarding the General Educational Development (GED) test, 
employment counseling, and access to literacy classes. These grants were made available 
to grantees to provide services to at-risk (category one) children and families. Category one 
is defined as those children who participated in one of the following programs: food 
stamps, Supplemental Security Income (SSI), Medicaid, Temporary Assistance for Needy 
Families (TANF), PeachCare for Kids, as well as those that were eligible for free and 
reduced-price lunch. For the 2003-04 school year, over $18 million in resource coordination 
grants was awarded, as of January 8, 2004. 
13Certification in New Jersey’s Abbott program, for example, requires that teachers possess 
a preschool through grade 3 (P-3) endorsement. To qualify for a P-3 endorsement, 
candidates must possess, at a minimum, a bachelor’s degree, a 2.5 grade point average, 
pass a state test when identified, and complete a state-approved preparation program at 
one of the state’s colleges or universities. As of June 2004, New Jersey officials estimated 
that about 93 percent of the teachers in the Abbott school districts have met the 
certification requirement.  
Page 14 
GAO-04-852  State Prekindergarten Programs 
 
 
 
held four-year education-related or other degrees with some additional 
training in early childhood education or development. Combined, about 79 
percent of the lead teachers in Georgia had at least a four-year education- 
related college degree.
14 
States and school districts established collaborations with community-
based organizations differently and often relied on them extensively to 
provide prekindergarten services to children. For example, Georgia had a 
centralized program and the state’s Department of Early Care and 
Learning was directly responsible for establishing collaborations with 
community-based organizations such as child care centers and U.S. 
military bases. In contrast, in the other three states we visited, local school 
districts had responsibility for establishing collaborations. In New York, 
the state required that school districts use at least 10 percent of their 
universal prekindergarten grant funds to serve children in community-
based organizations, but statewide over 60 percent of four-year-olds were 
participating in community-based prekindergarten programs during the 
2002-03 school year. The extent of collaborations varied between the two 
prekindergarten programs in New Jersey during the 2003-04 school year. 
In the Abbott school districts, the state was ordered by the New Jersey 
Supreme Court to provide full-day prekindergarten for all three- and four-
year-olds; over 70 percent of these children were served by community-
based providers.
15 In contrast, in New Jersey’s non-Abbott ECPA school 
districts, only about 11 percent of the children received prekindergarten 
from community-based providers. While state officials in Oklahoma were 
supportive of collaborations, local school district officials determined the 
role of community-based providers in their prekindergarten programs. In 
Oklahoma, most children were enrolled in prekindergarten programs in 
                                                                                                                                    
14Of the remaining lead teachers in Georgia, about 21 percent held technical or other 
degrees. 
15In May 1998 the New Jersey Supreme Court mandated that children aged three and four 
living in the 30 highest-poverty school districts in the state receive a high-quality preschool 
education. The New Jersey Department of Education funds a 6-hour, 180-day 
prekindergarten program, and the New Jersey Department of Human Services funds a 
wraparound program that provides daily before- and after-care and a summer program. In 
total, the full-day, full-year program is available to eligible children for 10 hours per day, 
245 days per year. The New Jersey Department of Education reported that during the 2002-
03 school year, the Abbott program enrolled nearly 36,500 children at a cost of about $347 
million for prekindergarten. An official of the New Jersey Department of Human Services 
also reported that about $103 million was spent for the wraparound services during the 
2003 fiscal year. In addition, school districts can opt to have a 3-hour-per-day program for 
20 days over the summer break. This program would also be funded by the state 
Department of Education.

districts collaborated with community-based organizations or the number 
of children participating in them. These and other key differences in the

certification in early childhood or elementary education; four-year-college degree in certain education 
fields or four-year degree in psychology or social work with additional studies in early childhood

All four states relied primarily on state resources but differed in other 
aspects of funding such as amounts per child, funding methods, and the 
extent to which these methods and amounts provided for financially stable 
programs. During the 2002-03 school year, enrollments and state spending 
for prekindergarten services varied widely among the five state programs. 
Based on data we collected from the states, spending ranged from 
approximately $347 million for prekindergarten services in the 30 Abbott 
school districts in New Jersey to about $30 million for the 102 non-Abbott 
ECPA school districts in New Jersey. Table 4 provides information on the 
primary methods of program funding, estimated number of participating 
children, and estimated state spending among the five programs during the 
2002-03 school year.

aIn addition to receiving formula-driven funding, Abbott school districts also receive preschool 
expansion aid. This aid is derived from the state’s general revenues and is provided to the Abbott 
districts to support the required full-day program for three- and four-year-olds. 
Page 17 
GAO-04-852  State Prekindergarten Programs 
 
 
 
Per child expenditures for full-day and half-day prekindergarten varied 
across the four states we visited and were consistently less than the state’s 
per pupil expenditures for kindergarten through grade 12. New Jersey’s 
Abbott districts had the highest funding per child for full-day 
prekindergarten, relative to kindergarten through grade 12 funding.
16 In the 
remaining states, funding for full-day prekindergarten was much less than 
the level of funding per child in kindergarten through grade 12. See figure 
3 for comparisons of per child expenditures for prekindergarten and 
kindergarten through grade 12 in the four states we visited. 
                                                                                                                                    
16While New Jersey’s Abbott prekindergarten program per child funding was more than 
double the other state programs, certain aspects of the program contributed to the 
increased costs. For example, one feature (maximum class size) increased program cost by 
roughly 25 percent by limiting enrollment to 15 children. The New Jersey Department of 
Education also initiated a number of activities to improve program quality. For example, 
during the 2002-03 school year, the state provided a year-long training program for 105 
master teachers who, in turn, mentored and coached over 4,000 classroom teachers and 
assistant teachers in the Abbott school districts. The New Jersey Department of Education 
also recommended that the Abbott school districts employ one family worker for every 45 
students. Family workers are to meet regularly with teachers and families to identify 
specific concerns or needs, assist in locating resources in the community, and support 
families in utilizing these resources.

Sources: Data on per child funding for kindergarten through grade 12 were obtained from the U.S. Department of Education,
National Center for Education Statistics; data on per child funding for state prekindergarten programs were obtained from the Georgia
Department of Early Care and Learning, and the state departments of education in New Jersey, New York, and Oklahoma.
Note: State per child funding for prekindergarten programs was for the 2002-03 school year, and 
kindergarten through grade 12 expenditures were for the 2000-01 school year. 
 
Apart from New Jersey’s Abbott and Georgia’s prekindergarten programs, 
the other state programs we examined were largely half-day. New Jersey’s 
non-Abbott ECPA program, New York, and Oklahoma permitted local 
school districts to operate half-day prekindergarten. However, these states 
differed in how they funded their half- and full-day programs. School 
districts in New Jersey’s non-Abbott ECPA program and New York 
received the same amount per child whether they operated half-day or full-
day programs, and about 80 percent of the children attended half-day 
prekindergarten in each of the two programs. In Oklahoma, local school 
districts received about $1,743 per child (54 percent of the full-day rate), 
and over half of the four-year-olds participating in the state’s 
prekindergarten program were enrolled in half-day programs during the 
2002-03 school year. 
Page 19 
GAO-04-852  State Prekindergarten Programs 
 
 
 
The four states varied in how they funded their state-sponsored 
prekindergarten programs, and officials in two states told us that the 
financial outlook of their programs was stable. According to two 
New Jersey state officials, because of the state supreme court decision and 
subsequent court order, New Jersey was committed to providing a quality 
prekindergarten program to all three- and four-year-olds who lived in the 
Abbott school districts. In addition, funding for both New Jersey’s Abbott 
and non-Abbott ECPA prekindergarten programs was part of the school 
funding formula. Oklahoma supported prekindergarten through the 
funding formula, as it did for other school grades, and state officials told 
us they believed that funding for the program was stable. 
However, funding for prekindergarten in the other two states may be more 
uncertain. For example, funding levels for New York’s state-sponsored 
prekindergarten had increased somewhat for the past 3 years but were 
insufficient to allow the state to implement a universal prekindergarten 
program available to all four-year-olds by the 2001-02 school year as 
planned. During the same period, New York financed its program from 
general revenue funds as a line item in the budget, and in 2003, the 
program was targeted for elimination because of state fiscal shortfalls. 
While avoiding elimination, limited increases in funding have restricted the 
state’s ability to expand the program over the past several years. Most 
eligible districts participated in the program. However, about two-thirds of 
the school districts were not eligible for the state-sponsored 
prekindergarten program during the 2002-03 school year. 
Georgia has historically relied on the state lottery to fund its 
prekindergarten program. When the lottery was initially created, its 
proceeds were set aside for three programs, including state-sponsored 
prekindergarten. Currently, lottery funds are used to support 
prekindergarten and a program to provide academic scholarships for 
eligible high school graduates. However, over time, a greater percentage of 
the lottery funds has been designated for the college scholarship program 
than for prekindergarten. Additionally, lotteries recently began in two 
neighboring states, and officials we interviewed were concerned that 
Georgia’s lottery proceeds may level off. State officials told us that lottery 
funds may be insufficient to entirely support the prekindergarten program 
by 2007, and the state has begun to look at stop gap measures to protect 
lottery funding if needed in the future. 
The four states reported using small amounts of federal funds to support 
their prekindergarten programs; these amounts were generally small 
relative to state funding levels. For example, two states—Georgia and 
Page 20 
GAO-04-852  State Prekindergarten Programs 
 
 
 
Oklahoma—used some prekindergarten monies to meet their CCDF  
matching or maintenance-of-effort requirements.
17 In fiscal year 2002, 
Georgia used about $2.4 million in lottery funds for CCDF state matching 
and maintenance-of-effort, which represented about 1 percent of the state 
funding for prekindergarten. These funds were used for extended day 
(before- and after-school) for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families 
(TANF) eligible children participating in prekindergarten. Oklahoma used 
about $2.1 million of its prekindergarten funds to meet CCDF 
maintenance-of-effort requirements, which represented about 3 percent of 
the state funding for prekindergarten. In fiscal year 2002, New York 
transferred $61.3 million from the TANF program to the state 
prekindergarten program, but this was done for only one year.
18 None of 
the other states used TANF funds to support the expansion of their 
prekindergarten programs. While state officials told us that Title I, 
Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, and Head Start program funds 
were also used at the local level to support prekindergarten, they did not 
know the exact amounts from these other federal sources. 
 
 
                                                                                                                                    
17States receive CCDF funds from potentially four funding streams. Each state’s annual 
federal allocation consists of separate discretionary, mandatory, and matching funds. A 
state does not have to obligate or spend any state funds to receive the discretionary and 
mandatory funds. However, to receive federal matching funds—and thus its full CCDF 
allocation—a state must maintain its program spending at a specified level, referred to as a 
state’s maintenance of effort, and spend additional state funds above that level. 
18TANF, a block grant to states, provides temporary assistance to needy families. In 
general, able-bodied TANF recipients, who receive cash assistance, must participate in 
work or work-related activities after receiving assistance for a maximum of 24 months, and 
there is a 5-year lifetime limit on federal assistance. Beyond work, work-related activities 
include education and training; job search; and participation in community service. States 
may also use a portion of TANF funds for child care services.

Some Program 
Features Had 
Potential Implications 
for Children’s 
Participation and 
Other Early 
Childhood Programs 
Some prekindergarten design features had implications for children’s 
participation and early childhood programs in the four states we visited. 
For example, both local officials and providers told us that transportation 
and program hours may have affected access to prekindergarten programs 
for children of low-income and working families. State and local officials, 
along with community-based providers and Head Start grantees, told us 
that collaborations were beneficial to their programs and had allowed 
rapid expansion of state prekindergarten. However, some challenges 
remained, such as the efforts needed to establish and maintain effective 
collaborations. Finally, few empirical data were available to quantify the 
effect of expanding state prekindergarten programs on the availability and 
prices for child care, and the anecdotal evidence we collected was mixed. 
Transportation and 
Program Hours May Have 
Implications for 
Participation 
 
Program features, which varied across states and school districts, may 
have affected participation, particularly for children of low-income and 
working families. None of the four states required prekindergarten 
providers to transport all participating children. Officials in some school 
districts told us that the lack of transportation may have decreased the 
participation of children from low-income and working families, and 10 of 
the 12 school districts we visited did not provide transportation to and 
from prekindergarten for all participating children. Some school district 
officials primarily cited insufficient funding as a reason for not providing 
transportation services. For example, in one Oklahoma school district, 
children did not necessarily attend prekindergarten classes at their 
neighborhood school; consequently, the district would have incurred 
additional costs to transport children to their designated school. One 
official in a rural school district we visited in New York told us that more 
children from low-income and working families would have participated in 
prekindergarten if transportation were provided. However, costs 
prohibited the district from offering such services. However, officials in 
the urban school district we visited in New York did not view the lack of 
transportation as a barrier to participation, as the prekindergarten 
programs were generally available in proximity to children’s homes or 
parents’ jobs. In Georgia, the Department of Early Care and Learning 
offered additional funding to providers who opted to transport eligible 
children to and from the prekindergarten program.
19 In May 2004, the 
Georgia Department of Early Care and Learning paid for the 
                                                                                                                                    
19Transportation reimbursements were available for category one children. 
Page 22 
GAO-04-852  State Prekindergarten Programs 
 
 
 
transportation of 13,152 children. In New Jersey, the Abbott school 
districts were required to provide transportation when needed. 
In Oklahoma, where the majority of the participating children attended 
half-day prekindergarten programs, school district officials told us that the 
length of the school day affected participation. In all three school districts 
we visited, local officials told us that shortened program hours may have 
hindered the participation of children of low-income and working families. 
Officials from one Oklahoma school district told us that the combination 
of a half-day program coupled with the lack of transportation to and from 
the prekindergarten program reduced the participation of children from 
low-income and working families. In that district, approximately 45 
percent of the district’s elementary school population was eligible for free 
and reduced price lunch during the 2003-04 school year, but only 29 
percent of the children enrolled in prekindergarten were eligible for free 
and reduced price lunch, indicating lower participation of children from 
low-income families. Similarly, in another Oklahoma school district, while 
about 84 percent of the district’s student population was eligible for free 
and reduced price lunch, 60 percent of children who participated in 
prekindergarten were eligible for free and reduced price lunch. However, 
officials in two Oklahoma school districts told us that certain factors 
discouraged them from offering full-day programs; for example, they were 
able to serve twice as many children with half-day programs, rather than 
full-day programs, using the same resources (classrooms and teachers). 
Additionally, one of these officials told us that it would be difficult to 
implement full-day prekindergarten while the school district only offered a 
half-day kindergarten program. 
Finally, some school district officials told us that the location of the 
program could also affect the participation of children of working families. 
In particular, half-day programs without transportation could be more 
appealing to low-income and working families if they were offered in a 
child care center where the child could receive care for the duration of the 
work day. One urban school district we visited primarily offered half-day 
prekindergarten classes. However, the school district officials told us that 
the prekindergarten classes were sometimes offered in conjunction with 
other programs at the same location. A district official and child care 
providers in this school district told us that this arrangement met the 
needs of low-income and working families as children would receive a full 
day of care. Officials and child care providers in this school district told us 
that in order to offer a full day of care, some child care providers 
supplemented the state-sponsored prekindergarten program with other 
Page 23

monies, including Head Start funding, CCDF subsidies, and parent 
payments. 
State and Local Officials 
and Community-Based 
Providers Said 
Collaborations Were 
Beneficial to Their 
Programs, but They Also 
Identified Some 
Challenges 
 
Although state and local officials, as well as staff of community-based 
organizations, told us that collaborations were beneficial, some challenges 
remained. Officials in all four states we visited told us that such 
collaborations allowed them to serve more children, and three of the five 
programs served most prekindergarten children in community-based 
organizations such as Head Start and child care centers. In Georgia, New 
Jersey, and New York, officials reported that they made extensive use of 
collaborations because they wanted to implement the prekindergarten 
programs quickly and schools were often at capacity. In New Jersey, the 
state supreme court ordered the state to provide full-day kindergarten as 
well as full-day preschool for three- and four-year-olds in the 30 Abbott 
school districts. To implement the court order, the districts turned to 
community-based organizations to accommodate the influx of children. In 
New York, school districts were only required to use at least 10 percent of 
their universal prekindergarten grant funds to serve children in 
community-based organizations. Two school districts we visited in New 
York served the majority of participating children in community-based 
organizations (66 and 100 percent). However, in Oklahoma, where school 
districts had been experiencing declining enrollment, collaborations with 
community-based organizations were less prevalent, as districts were able 
to accommodate prekindergarten children in public schools. Officials from 
most of the school districts we visited that did use collaborations told us 
that the collaborations allowed them to take advantage of the existing 
early child care and education infrastructure, such as buildings, 
equipment, and assistant teachers to increase program capacity and 
reduce program costs. 
Child care providers who partnered with state prekindergarten programs 
generally had favorable experiences with collaborations as well. 
Specifically, providers mentioned increased enrollment, improved quality 
of programs, and increased access to school district resources as benefits 
of their partnerships. Some providers who collaborated with the state 
prekindergarten programs in Georgia, New Jersey, and New York told us 
that they expanded their centers to serve more children of all ages—as 
some parents enrolled the younger siblings of their prekindergarten 
children in the same child care center. In addition, child care providers in 
all four states told us that the overall quality of care had improved as a 
result of collaborating with the state prekindergarten program. Some 
providers attributed the improved quality to various factors, including a 
Page 24 
GAO-04-852  State Prekindergarten Programs 
 
 
 
greater focus on learning, the presence of credentialed teachers, and 
higher standards for the children. Finally, some child care providers who 
collaborated with state-sponsored prekindergarten programs told us that 
the partnership allowed them increased access to school district resources 
such as professional development and materials such as new computers 
for the classrooms. 
Head Start grantees also told us that collaborations were beneficial to 
their programs. For example, in Georgia and New York, some Head Start 
grantees who provided prekindergarten services stated they were better 
able to serve children by leveraging state prekindergarten and Head Start 
funds. These grantees told us they were able to expand program hours and 
enrich the learning environment while still providing Head Start’s services, 
including establishing family partnerships.
20 In Georgia, Head Start 
grantees served 3,654 children, or just over 5 percent of the children 
enrolled in the program during the 2004 fiscal year. In New York, Head 
Start provided about 345 classrooms of prekindergarten—representing 
about 9 percent of the total number of prekindergarten classrooms. Two 
Head Start grantees told us that since the state prekindergarten program 
served four-year-olds they began serving more three-year-olds. As a result, 
children from low-income families could participate in 2 full years of 
preschool. 
While collaborations generally benefited early childhood programs, some 
challenges existed in establishing and maintaining partnerships between 
state-sponsored prekindergarten programs and community-based 
organizations. State and school district officials told us that establishing 
and maintaining collaborations took effort, required expertise, and 
involved increased monitoring and technical assistance, including 
financial guidance. For example, while one school district we visited had a 
staff person responsible for establishing and maintaining collaborations, 
another school district did not have such an expert and was unsure about 
how to develop partnerships or arrange the formal contracts needed to 
collaborate. 
                                                                                                                                    
20The Head Start program performance standards on family partnerships provide minimum 
requirements for grantees in areas such as family goal setting; accessing community 
services and resources; parent involvement in child development and education; parent 
involvement in health, nutrition, and mental health education; and parent involvement in 
shared decision making and community advocacy. 
Page 25 
GAO-04-852  State Prekindergarten Programs 
 
 
 
Child care providers also mentioned certain challenges such as insufficient 
or uncertain funding. For example, in New York and Georgia, where per 
child funding to community-based organizations had remained fairly level 
for at least the past 3 years, some child care providers told us that the per 
child funding was insufficient and they had to use other funding sources to 
support the collaboration. In addition, we found that challenges existed in 
establishing the collaborations with Head Start in all four states. In both 
Oklahoma and New York, there was no formal mechanism, such as a 
statewide contract to facilitate collaboration between school districts and 
Head Start grantees, and the two programs sometimes coexisted in the 
same community without the benefit of shared resources. Two of the three 
school districts we visited in Oklahoma did not collaborate with Head 
Start; the third served about 9 percent of its prekindergarten children 
through collaborations with Head Start grantees. Challenges in 
establishing collaborations with Head Start also remained in New Jersey.
21 
In 2003, New Jersey’s Department of Education and Department of Human 
Services developed plans for including Head Start grantees as partners in 
providing prekindergarten in the Abbott districts over the following 3 
years. However, many challenges remained to achieving this goal including 
agreement on appropriate per child funding levels, as well as challenges in 
aligning curricula and other coordination issues. 
Few Data Available to 
Determine the Impact of 
State Prekindergarten 
Programs on Availability 
and Prices of Child Care 
 
While some community-based providers were initially apprehensive about 
the potential impact of the widespread availability of states’ 
prekindergarten programs on the market for child care, we found few data 
to support this concern. In the states we visited, neither state officials nor 
the child care provider community had data regarding the effects of 
expanded prekindergarten programs on the availability and prices of child 
care. The available data were limited to child care market rate surveys, 
which were conducted by states to obtain information needed to set 
reimbursement rates for child care, and data collected every 5 years by the 
Census of Service Industries on the number of tax filings by child day care 
                                                                                                                                    
21In 2000, the New Jersey supreme court approved the use of community providers such as 
Head Start as part of the Abbott preschool program whenever practical.  Abbott v. Burke, 
748 A.2d 82 (N.J. 2000). Two years later, the court discussed the problems encountered in 
coordinating the two programs, including differing teacher qualifications, differing program 
standards, and the costs associated with bringing Head Start up to state standards. The 
court concluded that “districts should utilize Head Start providers unless they are not able 
and willing to comply with Abbott preschool standards or unless the cost of doing so is 
demonstrably more expensive than other high-quality alternatives.” Abbott Ex. El. Abbott v. 
Burke, 790 A.2d 842 at 853 (N.J. 2002).

providers. Market rate surveys provided relatively recent data on prices, 
but generally did not include sufficient data to isolate any effects of 
prekindergarten and were not always collected in a comparable or reliable 
form before and after prekindergarten expansion. In contrast, the state 
level data currently available from the Census of Service Industries were 
collected in a consistent fashion over time and across states, but were 
available only for the period through 1997, just 2 years after significant 
growth in the prekindergarten program in Georgia, the oldest expanded 
program of the five we studied.
22 The data indicate that the number of 
small child care providers per 1,000 preschoolers in Georgia and the 
nation as a whole followed similar growth trends from 1987 to 1997, the 
years of available data. Further, in the same time period, the number of 
child care centers per 1,000 preschoolers and the number of employees 
paid by these centers increased in both Georgia and the nation (where 
prekindergarten services were generally less available than in Georgia). 
However, this does not prove that the expansion of prekindergarten 
programs had no effect on the number of child care providers. For 
example, perhaps the number of providers would have increased even 
more had prekindergarten programs not been expanded. 
The anecdotal evidence regarding the effects of prekindergarten programs 
on the market for child care was mixed. For example, representatives of 
the child care community mentioned some positive effects on the market 
for child care, including the increased availability and accessibility of high-
quality child care and early education for children from low-income 
families. However, some child care providers in Georgia, New Jersey, and 
Oklahoma told us that state programs had adverse effects on the business 
of child care, but they were unable to provide us with supporting 
documentation. According to child care providers, the care of three- and 
four-year-olds was less costly than the care of infants and toddlers, and the 
revenue generated from caring for the older children subsidized the care 
of younger children and made up a significant portion of their revenues. 
Child care providers also said that the enrollment of four-year-olds in state 
prekindergarten programs could result in child care centers raising prices 
to compensate for the loss of such revenues or even going out of business. 
In addition, some child care providers in Georgia told us that because state 
program funding did not cover the costs of operating prekindergarten, 
                                                                                                                                    
22Georgia’s program was initially a targeted program. It expanded in the early years (1992-
1995) but remained targeted. In the 1995-96 school year, the program became available to 
children regardless of family income. At this time, the program went from enrolling 15,000 
children to enrolling 44,000 children. The program has grown steadily since. 
Page 27 
GAO-04-852  State Prekindergarten Programs 
 
 
 
some centers had raised the rates for other services such as extended day 
care. 
However, any potential effects of prekindergarten on the price and 
availability of child care may have been mitigated by certain design 
aspects of the programs in the states we visited. For example, while the 
majority of prekindergarten children in Oklahoma were served in public 
school settings, the potential effects on the child care market may have 
been mitigated because most children were in half-day prekindergarten 
programs and some needed child care before and after the program. In 
Oklahoma, the state Department of Human Services also provided a full-
day reimbursement for CCDF-eligible children who used child care for 
more than 4 hours a day. As a result, the state’s half-day program appeared 
to have minimal impact on child care providers. In New Jersey’s Abbott 
districts and Georgia, which had full-day prekindergarten, the classes were 
often situated in community-based organizations. Consequently, many 
four-year-olds who attended these programs remained in community-
based settings, and child care providers maintained their enrollment of 
four-year-olds. Furthermore, in the Abbott districts, the New Jersey 
Department of Human Services provided additional funds to cover 4 hours 
of child care, beyond the 6 hour educational program. As a result, some 
child care centers were reimbursed for providing services for up to 10 
hours per day. 
Some Data Have Been 
Collected on 
Outcomes for 
Participating Children 
 
Some data have been collected on outcomes for participating children, but 
little is known about outcomes for their families. In all the school districts 
we visited, prekindergarten teachers routinely assessed children and 
provided parents with information about their child’s progress during the 
school year. However, the states did not collect and analyze these 
assessment data. We found two studies that provided information about 
the educational outcomes of state prekindergarten programs on children 
in Oklahoma and Georgia.
23 One study focused on the Tulsa School District 
and found that children who participated in the Tulsa prekindergarten 
program had significantly higher scores on several school readiness 
measures than children who did not participate in the program. A second

study analyzed statewide data regarding Georgia’s prekindergarten 
program and reported that children who participated in one of three 
programs studied (Georgia’s prekindergarten program, Head Start, and 
private preschools) generally made significant gains on developmental 
skills during the prekindergarten year. None of the four states we visited 
reported collecting information regarding the impact of their programs on 
families. State officials told us that prekindergarten programs increased 
choices for families, but none reported knowing whether the 
prekindergarten program had any effect on parents’ work efforts. 
Teachers Regularly 
Assessed Children’s 
Progress, although States 
Did Not Systematically 
Collect These Data 
 
In general, teachers assessed the progress of the children’s development in 
the course of teaching prekindergarten using developmentally appropriate 
assessments. We found that the types of assessments varied across 
prekindergarten providers, and some providers used multiple types of 
assessments. For example, assessments included checklists that rated the 
child’s progress on various developmental objectives, observational 
records, as well as portfolio assessments, which consisted of a collection 
of the child’s work and projects that showed the child’s progress 
throughout the school year. In general, such assessments were used to 
inform the teacher and provide information to parents during the school 
year. None of the states required a particular assessment of children’s 
outcomes.
24 
State officials acknowledged the importance of collecting and analyzing 
student outcome data. However, such analysis had not been systematically 
conducted on a statewide basis in any of the four states we visited. The 
outcome data that the teachers had were not necessarily in a form 
conducive to collection and analysis by the states. Officials offered various 
reasons for not collecting outcome data. In New York, officials told us that 
there was no funding for large-scale data collection efforts and they were 
awaiting the results of this year’s fourth grade state test to analyze the 
potential long-term effects of their prekindergarten program, since some 
of these fourth graders had participated in the prekindergarten program as 
four-year-olds. In New Jersey, state officials told us that they planned to 
perform a program evaluation including children’s outcomes after the 
program had matured. In Oklahoma, state officials told us that they did not 
                                                                                                                                    
24Officials in Georgia reported that the Department of Early Care and Learning was in the 
process of developing and piloting a standard assessment process for all prekindergarten 
children. 
Page 29 
GAO-04-852  State Prekindergarten Programs 
 
 
 
collect outcome data for all children in the state, but limited information 
regarding program outcomes was available in two school districts. For 
example, we found that one school district we visited in Oklahoma had 
collected and analyzed data on the outcomes of 22 children over a 1-year 
period, 11 of whom participated in the district’s prekindergarten program. 
Two Studies Provided 
Some Information about 
the Outcomes for Children 
Who Participated in State 
Prekindergarten Programs 
 
Two recent studies provided some information on outcomes for children 
in two state prekindergarten programs. A study conducted by researchers 
at Georgetown University analyzed the short-term effects of 
prekindergarten on children in the Tulsa public schools and found positive 
effects of the Tulsa program. In particular, the study found that children 
who participated in the Tulsa prekindergarten program had higher scores 
on both cognitive knowledge and language measures, and on measures of 
motor skills, than did similar children who did not participate. 
Additionally, the Tulsa study found that impacts tended to be larger for 
African American and Hispanic children, and that there was little impact 
for white children, although the authors discussed certain ceiling effects 
that may have made it difficult to detect any impacts for white children as 
a whole.
25 The study also found that children who qualified for the full free 
lunch program showed greater benefits than the population as a whole, 
and benefits were larger for children from low-income families who 
participated in full-day programs than those participating in half-day 
programs. 
The second study, sponsored in part by the Georgia Department of Early 
Care and Learning and conducted by Georgia State University, also found 
progress among children who participated in the Georgia prekindergarten 
program during the 2001-02 school year. The study compared the progress 
of children in three early education settings: private preschool, Georgia’s 
state prekindergarten program, and Head Start.
26 Children participating in 
the three programs performed at different levels upon entering the 
programs. The study reported that at the beginning of prekindergarten, 
children enrolled in Head Start demonstrated less mastery of certain skills 
than did children in the Georgia prekindergarten program, who, in turn, 
                                                                                                                                    
25Ceiling effects can occur when children pretest at or near the highest possible score on a 
given assessment. In such cases, if the same assessment is used as a post-test, it is difficult 
to measure any gains children have made. 
26The study did not include a comparison group of children who did not attend any 
preschool program. 
Page 30 
GAO-04-852  State Prekindergarten Programs 
 
 
 
scored lower than children in private preschools. The study found that 
children in all three programs made significant gains over the course of 1 
year, though in general, the gains made by the prekindergarten children 
were not significantly different from the gains made by the other two 
groups of children. By the end of prekindergarten, or at the beginning of 
the kindergarten year, the relative rankings of the children from the 
different programs had not changed. The researchers also matched 
children with similar backgrounds to compare the effectiveness of Head 
Start and Georgia’s state prekindergarten program. When comparing the 
language, communication, problem-solving, and basic mastery skill scores 
for the matched samples of children, researchers noted one case—basic 
skill mastery—in which the gap between scores of the state 
prekindergarten children and the Head Start children widened to a 
statistically significant level at the end of the prekindergarten year. 
Concluding 
Observations 
 
Citing benefits of prekindergarten, many states have made an investment 
in the early education of young children, especially four-year-olds. 
Georgia, New Jersey, New York, and Oklahoma have taken steps to 
expand early educational opportunities for preschoolers. These four states 
offer different approaches for consideration by other states that are 
considering whether to expand the scope of their prekindergarten 
programs. Given that states have limited resources, an opportunity exists 
to engage community-based providers such as Head Start grantees and 
other early education and care providers in the coordinated delivery of 
additional prekindergarten services. Collaborations between school 
districts and community-based organizations facilitate the coordination of 
child care and early learning for preschoolers and can provide additional 
classroom capacity. At the same time, these partnerships can help allay 
fears among child care providers that prekindergarten programs would 
supplant the need for community-based services. 
It is also important to acknowledge the trade-offs of certain program 
features. For example, while programs with limited hours may 
accommodate a higher number of children within the same facility and 
may be less likely to affect existing child care providers, they may create 
barriers to participation for children of working families and show smaller 
effects in school readiness of children. Also, prekindergarten programs 
may benefit by collaborating with existing programs to maximize the 
efficient use of limited state and federal education resources. However, 
such arrangements may make it necessary for states and school districts 
to invest resources to facilitate such coordination. Perhaps the biggest 
trade-off that states face is whether the benefits of an expanded 
Page 31

prekindergarten program outweigh those of one that is more targeted. 
Targeted programs have the advantage of giving more intensive services to 
eligible children who may benefit most from prekindergarten, but such 
programs exclude some children who might also benefit. Additional 
information on outcomes for children in the most intensive programs, 
particularly relative to children who do not receive comparable services, 
may be helpful to other states considering varied types of prekindergarten 
services, as would data on the benefits of half-day programs relative to 
full-day programs. 
Agency Comments 
 
The Departments of Health and Human Services and Education were 
provided a draft of this report for review and comment. The Department of 
Health and Human Services commented that given the discussions 
surrounding the “state option” proposals being held during Head Start 
reauthorization, our report is informative. Education’s Executive 
Secretariat stated that the department appreciated the opportunity to 
review the draft but was not going to provide agency comments. Both 
agencies provided technical comments, which we incorporated as 
appropriate. 
 
 
We are sending copies of this report to the Secretary of Health and Human 
Services, the Secretary of Education, relevant congressional committees, 
and other interested parties. Please contact me on (202) 512-7215 if you or 
your staff have any questions about this report. In addition, the report will 
be available at no charge on GAO’s Web site at http://www.gao.gov. Other 
GAO contacts and staff acknowledgments are listed in appendix III.

Appendix I: Scope and Methodology 
In conducting our review, we obtained and analyzed information from the 
federal Departments of Education and Health and Human Services, state 
agencies,
1 and local education agencies (LEA). We visited four states, and 
in each state we interviewed staff from state agencies and LEAs, and 
generally included one urban, one suburban, and one rural school district 
in each state—for a total of 12 school districts. We also interviewed early 
childhood education and child care policy experts and reviewed selected 
current literature on state-sponsored prekindergarten programs. 
For our fieldwork, we considered states that (1) had expanded programs 
and aimed to serve all children whose families wanted them to attend, (2) 
served large numbers of children in their prekindergarten programs, and 
(3) had well-established programs. We attempted to include varied 
program models and gave some priority to states that had studied their 
efforts. 
To determine how states designed their prekindergarten programs, we 
interviewed state and local education officials and officials of 13 
community-based organizations who were direct providers of state 
prekindergarten services. We also reviewed documents related to states’ 
prekindergarten programs, including state laws, general program 
information, state data on program participation and costs, curriculum 
guides, content standards, and contracts governing collaborations with 
community-based organizations. We obtained information to describe the 
state-sponsored prekindergarten programs and reviewed the data for 
reasonableness. We assessed reliability of specific information, including 
estimates of age-eligible children and program expenditures, by 
interviewing state officials in all four states about their data reliability 
assessment processes. On the basis of this information, we concluded that 
the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report. In 
addition, we performed a detailed review of the methodology of a National 
Institute for Early Education Research report and found it to be sufficient 
for descriptive purposes. The data that were used for background 
purposes were not independently verified. 
To determine the potential implications of prekindergarten on other 
programs that serve four-year-olds, we interviewed state child care 
                                                                                                                                    
1In New Jersey, New York, and Oklahoma, we collected information and interviewed 
officials from the state education agencies (SEA); in Georgia, we collected information and 
interviewed officials from the Department of Early Care and Learning, which administered 
the prekindergarten program.

administrators, state and local Head Start association directors, 
coordinators and program staff, as well as staff of local child care centers. 
We also met with national and state representatives of the National Child 
Care Association (an association of managers and owners of child care 
centers) and related organizations, as well as state and local staff of child 
care resource and referral offices. We also reviewed selected national and 
state data on child care availability and prices. Finally, we interviewed 
state officials regarding federal funds, including Title I of the Elementary 
and Secondary Education Act, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, 
Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, and the Child Care and 
Development Block Grant. We did not review the expenses of providers of 
state prekindergarten services to ascertain the extent, if any, to which 
federal funds or other revenues may have subsidized provision of 
prekindergarten. 
To determine what is known about the impacts of prekindergarten 
programs on children and families in the states visited, we interviewed 
state and local education officials and local policy experts. We also 
identified two studies on children’s outcomes that met our selection 
criteria: studies that (1) analyzed student achievement and (2) compared 
prekindergarten children with a control or comparison group of children 
who did not attend the state-sponsored prekindergarten programs.
2 To 
collect information systematically, we developed a data collection 
instrument and examined each study to assess the adequacy of the 
samples and measures employed, the reasonableness and rigor of the 
statistical techniques used to analyze them, and the validity of the results 
and conclusions that were drawn from the analyses. A social scientist read 
and coded the documentation for each study. A second social scientist 
reviewed each completed data collection instrument and the relevant 
documentation to verify the accuracy of every coded item. We found these 
two studies to be sufficiently reliable and rigorous to include in our report. 
                                                                                                                                    
2We identified a third study, the Rochester Early Childhood Assessment Partnership 2002-
2003 Annual Report, but did not review the study because it did not include comparison 
groups and thus could not isolate the potential effects of New York’s universal 
prekindergarten program on the children who attended.

Appendix I: Scope and Methodology 
 
We did not identify any studies that assessed the impact of these 
prekindergarten programs on working families such as workforce 
participation. 
We conducted our work between October 2003 and August 2004 in 
accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
