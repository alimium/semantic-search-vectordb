Weather States in the Azores 
 
Fair-weather most frequent but 
significant amounts of shallow 
cumulus, stratocumulus, and 
storm clouds 
 
Fair-weather increases southward 
and storm clouds northward of the 
Azores grid box. 
Azores vs Global WS 
 
Lower fair-weather and 
deep convection  frequency 
and higher frequency of 
shallow cumulus and 
stratocumulus clouds

Weather States in the GISS GCM 
 
Model severely overpredicts the fair-
weather WS and underpredicts the 
low cloud WS 
 
Tropical convection is overpredicted

GISS GCM WS in the Azores 
 
Most GCM WS deficiencies in 
the global domain are present in 
the Azores analysis

Summary 
 
 
 
Weather State analysis shows Azores to be a good lab to study major 
deficiencies in GISS GCM cloud property simulations 
 
 
Tools are in place to allow us to slide back and forth between global and 
local scale observations and model simulations. 
 
 
The strategy is to use case study SCM and LES simulations constrained 
by AMF observations to understand model deficiencies in simulating cloud 
processes and attribute them to forcing field inadequacies  or 
parameterization problems, and then use the satellite and GCM analysis to 
understand the relevance of those deficiencies to the global model climate 
simulations.
