POSITIVE BEHAVIOR GUIDANCE
POSITIVE BEHAVIOR GUIDANCE    
The City of Eureka’s Summer Camp Programs provide youth with the opportu-
nity to gain valuable life skills in decision making, peer relations, cooperation, 
and building self-confidence.  Staff utilize and encourage the practice of positive 
recognition as an effective method of behavior guidance and are constantly on 
 the lookout for what kids are doing right! 
At Summer Camp youth... 
• 
Engage in diverse and meaningful activities that develop values, skills, and 
relationships. 
• 
Have equal rights to be accepted, respected and valued by others. 
• 
Are involved in decision making and program design.  When youth have a 
voice they are far more likely to enjoy themselves and behave cooperatively. 
• 
Enjoy a variety of fun incentive programs that are used to encourage safe, 
respectful, and responsible behavior. 
 
Behavior that does not contribute to the well-being of others will be dealt with in 
a fair and respectful manner.  Natural consequences will be applied to encourage 
learning.  Parents/Guardians will be notified of all inappropriate behaviors and 
may be requested to pick up their child immediately.  Program fees for days lost 
will not be reimbursed.  Summer Camp Staff reserve the right to remove any 
    child permanently from the program should it be necessary to do so.
