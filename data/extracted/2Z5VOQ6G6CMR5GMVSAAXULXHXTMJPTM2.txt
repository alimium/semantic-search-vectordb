Preface
The Office of Security and Safety Performance Assurance (SSA) is responsible for the development, 
promulgation, and evaluation of security programs, and the independent oversight of security; cyber 
security; emergency management; and environment, safety, and health programs throughout the 
Department.  SSA develops and assists in the implementation of strategies, policies, and technology 
pertaining to the protection of national security and other critical assets entrusted to the Department; and 
provides information and analysis regarding the effectiveness, vulnerabilities, and trends of the 
Department’s security, safety, and other programs and functions of interest to departmental senior 
management and other stakeholders. SSA also provides administrative support to the Office of the 
Departmental Representative to the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board.
Within the Other Defense Activities appropriation, the SSA program has three subprograms: Nuclear 
Safeguards and Security (NSS), Security Investigations (SI), and Program Direction.  Within NSS are 3 
key activities: Operational Support; Technology Development and Systems Deployment; and 
Classification, Declassification, and Controlled Information.  Within SI are 3 key activities: Federal 
Bureau of Investigation, Office of Personnel Management, and Related Security Investigations 
Activities.
This Overview will describe Strategic Context, Mission, and Benefits.  These items together put the 
appropriation in perspective.  The Annual Performance Results and Targets, Means and Strategies, and 
Validation and Verification sections address how the goals will be achieved and how performance will 
be measured.  Finally, this Overview will address Significant Program Shifts.

Strategic Context
Following publication of the Administration’s National Energy Policy, the Department developed a 
Strategic Plan that defines its mission, four strategic goals for accomplishing that mission, and seven 
general goals to support the strategic goals.  As stated in the Departmental Strategic Plan, DOE’s 
Strategic and General Goals will be accomplished not only through the efforts of the major program 
offices in the Department but with additional effort from offices which support the programs in carrying 
out the mission.  SSA performs critical functions, which directly support the mission of the Department.
These functions include developing and promulgating security policies, training, and technology 
throughout DOE; assisting the United States and other governments track the use and movement of
nuclear material; and providing information to the Secretary and other DOE managers regarding the 
status and effectiveness of the Department’s security and safety program implementation.
Mission
SSA provides for the development, promulgation, and evaluation of security programs, and the 
independent oversight of security; cyber security; emergency management; and environment, safety, and 
health programs throughout the Department; and provides security-related services to DOE 
Headquarters.  SSA also provides administrative support to the Departmental Representative to the 
Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board.
As stated in the Departmental Strategic Plan, DOE’s Strategic and General Goals will be accomplished

issues.
Benefits
DOE must implement effective security programs in an increasingly challenging threat environment.
The primary focus of SSA is on effectively and efficiently implementing protection programs that fully 
respond to the evolving Design Basis Threat Policy by addressing programmatic and technical 
uncertainties and establishing cooperation and useful dialog between managers and security 
professionals at all levels.  Towards this end, and in support of the unprecedented security initiatives 
announced by the Secretary in May 2004, SSA is: 1) streamlining existing security policies to remove 
ambiguity in roles, responsibilities, and requirements; eliminate conflicts; and incorporate recent 
updates; 2) emphasizing the deployment of innovative security technology to transition from manpower
intensive  to engineered systems that provide greater security at reduced lifecycle costs; 3) advancing the
professional development of DOE security and safety personnel to ensure that their training is 
responsive to the needs of the DOE community; 4) increasing the capabilities and responsiveness of the 
protective force; and 5) improving the defensive posture of DOE.
SSA also identifies and reports to senior DOE managers on site-specific and Department-wide issues 
regarding security, cyber security, emergency management, environment, safety, and health, 
classification and declassification programs and other programs using an efficient, systematic 
independent oversight process that emphasizes performance and performance testing; conducts follow-
up activities to determine the effectiveness of corrective actions; and promotes line management self-
assessment activities, thereby enhancing overall performance in these program areas.  In addition, SSA 
provides cross-organizational support to DOE efforts to resolve Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety 
Board-related technical and management issues necessary to ensure public health and safety.
Major FY 2005 Achievements
� Design Basis Threat Site Assistance Visits – In partnership with the National Nuclear Security 
Administration and Energy, Science, and Environment program and field locations; and Headquarters 
policy organizations, SSA successfully completed site assistance visits at 11 DOE field sites with the 
purpose of developing resource-efficient, sustainable protection strategies and assist in the development 
of realistic budget submissions to support timely implementation of the revised Design Basis Threat
Policy.

� Streamlining DOE Safeguards and Security Directives – SSA has combined 27 safeguards and 
security directives and several hundred guidance memoranda into an umbrella Order, 6 subject matter
manuals, and a reference manual.  The documents have been presented to the Deputy Secretary for 
review and approval.  Streamlining this information will make it easier for users of the information to 
better understand as well as to find a specific safeguard or security topics of interest; and will assure that 
any changes are consistently coordinated with other policies.

Means and Strategies
SSA will achieve its mission by issuing clear, concise security policies, providing cutting-edge
technology-based security solutions, providing world-class training programs for security and safety 
professionals, and applying rigorous independent oversight to departmental operations.
The SSA vision is to provide a sound foundation for protecting the Nation’s nuclear and energy assets 
through advanced technology deployment and professional development.  This vision captures the SSA 
role within the Department's overall security (including nuclear safeguards and security, cyber security, 
and information security) and safety (including emergency management, and environment, safety, and 
health) programs.  It also emphasizes the two areas that are necessary for the Department to achieve its 
mission in the most efficient and effective manner, i.e., increased use of technology and effective 
management and development of human capital.
In order to achieve its vision and perform its goals, it is necessary for SSA to maintain a highly qualified 
workforce with the expertise and skills necessary to support, manage, and conduct security and 
independent oversight operations now and in the foreseeable future.  The SSA workforce is, and must
be, comprised of world-class security and safety professionals grounded in science, engineering, and 
technology led by effective program and project managers with exceptional communications and 
marketing skills and supported by innovative resource management experts.
SSA requires the technical support of national-level experts to perform all its security, safety, and 
independent oversight activities. Contractor support continues to be a practicable and cost–effective
means to provide a surge pool of technical experts, as opposed to expanding the Federal employee base.
The following external factor could affect SSA’s ability to achieve its strategic goal, revisions to the 
Design Basis Threat Policy.  Revisions to the Design Basis Threat Policy based on changing geopolitical 
conditions have the greatest potential for affecting SSA’s mission, priorities, and stated performance 
targets.  Type and number of training courses developed and conducted, type and numbers of 
technologies deployed, and scope of independent oversight appraisals performed are all dependent and 
reliant upon current Design Basis Threat Policy timelines and depth of coverage.
SSA places a high degree of emphasis on working with DOE program and other staff offices to ensure 
that security and safety issues are identified and adequately addressed.  SSA also interfaces with 
organizations external to DOE to enhance the security posture of the United States as well as other 
foreign states that maintain inventories of nuclear material.  SSA maintains strong relationships with the 
following DOE organizations:
� Office of the Chief Information Officer (CIO)
� Office of Environment, Safety and Health (EH)
� Office of Intelligence (IN)
� Office of Counterintelligence (CN)
� National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA)
� Office of Energy, Science, and Environment (ESE)
� DOE Inspector General (IG)

Page 18
� DOE Office of Congressional and Intergovernmental Affairs (CI)
� Office of General Council (GC)
SSA also maintains strong relationships with the following U.S. Government Departments and Agencies
� Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board (DNFSB)
� Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC)
� Department of State (DOS)
� Department of Defense (DoD)
� Department of Homeland Security (DHS)
� Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)
� National Security Council (NSC)
� Office of Personnel Management (OPM)
Validation and Verification
To validate and verify program performance, SSA will continuously monitor achievements for all 
performance targets through weekly reporting mechanisms and periodic meetings with office directors.
In addition, appraisal performance targets will be verified and validated by the development of 
documented reports.
Significant Policy or Program Shifts
� Civil Penalties for Classified Information Security Violations Implementation:  The Secretary of
Energy directed SSA to be responsible for implementing Section 234B to the Atomic Energy Act of 
1954 as specified in the final rule in 10 Code of Federal Regulations Part 824.  The rule implements 
the requirements for issuing civil penalties for any person who enters into a contract or subcontract
with the Department and who violates any applicable rule, regulation, or Order issued by the 
Secretary of Energy relating to the safeguarding or security of Restricted Data or other classified or 
“sensitive information.”  Currently security directives are being reviewed to identify and insert 
appropriate language to account for this activity.  SSA is also in the process of developing the means 
and strategies for full implementation using the current Price Anderson Enforcement program as a 
model.
� Increased Emphasis on Technology Deployment:  The deployment of security technologies is a 
key strategy to avoid significant manpower increases that would otherwise be required to conform to
the Department’s updated Design Basis Threat Policy.  Towards that end, funding will be directed 
for the purchase and installation of systems determined to have a positive impact on security 
effectiveness as determined through the Design Basis Threat Site Assistance Visit analysis process.
The chosen technologies to be procured will be coordinated with the National Nuclear Security
Administration and other DOE program offices to ensure that security and safety requirements are 
being addressed, that training and systems effectiveness procedures are in place, and that 
promulgation of lessons learned throughout the complex is accomplished.

of the environment, safety and health of the public, departmental workforce, and critical assets and 
national security.  The National Training Center (NTC), located in Albuquerque, NM, is the 
designated Center of Excellence for security and safety training and the primary resource for 
performing these functions.
Course curriculum development and presentation of training represent the largest portion of the 
funding base.  The funding is used to support the NTC safety program and the nuclear security 
training operations including the development and presentation of weapons firing courses and 
instruction and academic courses to qualify security personnel for security duties throughout DOE.
Additionally, funds are used to support specialized courses in personnel security, information 
security, safe handling of nuclear materials, and vulnerability assessments.  Training is provided to 
the DOE security complex utilizing the facilities at the NTC and other DOE sites, e.g., Los Alamos 
National Laboratory, as well as through the DOE’s security distance-learning program.  NTC also 
deploys safety and security training teams to DOE field sites to maximize cost savings while 
maintaining the integrity of training.
Funding provides for continued analyses of an integrated security systems training platform to 
address deficiencies in training methodologies for security and safety professionals.  The analysis of 
an advanced DOE training facility concept provides DOE with options for developing realistic 
training in a hands-on simulated environment that assimilates multiple aspects of an integrated 
security system.
In support of the President’s Management Agenda regarding the strategic management of human 
capital and the Department’s Human Capital Management Strategic Plan, the NTC continues to 
develop and provide Professional Development Programs for security and safety personnel.  These 
programs are part of the Department's strategic planning instruments for addressing the experience
drain within the security and safety communities.  The Professional Development Programs provide 
a comprehensive set of training courses to support the Department’s professional development 
requirements and addresses the Secretarial Security Initiatives.
In addition to course development, funding is used for the operation and maintenance of the NTC 
facilities.  NTC facilities are spread across four distinct areas permitted to DOE by both the U.S. Air 
Force and the U.S. Forest Service.  Additionally, space no longer used by the Air Force and Sandia 
National Laboratories, is used for storage of sensitive items, e.g., weapons systems and ammunition.
Operation and maintenance funding also provides for utility and telecommunications services for 
Federal and contractor personnel and management of support programs necessary to provide for a 
safe and environmentally sound operation that conforms with the requirements of the Occupational 
Safety and Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, and state and local laws 
and regulations.  Specific projects identified for FY 2007 include upgrades to the Live Fire Range to

material, primarily within the United States, for the purposes of satisfying statutory requirements and 
international obligations and treaties; developing and/or providing protection of the material both for 
safety and security purposes; and managing sensitive nuclear materials.  These programs and projects 
support nuclear materials consolidation, nuclear nonproliferation, emergency response, and material 
disposition planning efforts.  The mission is also supported by development and maintenance of 
calibration equipment, materials, and methodologies by a central Federal authority to assure reliable 
and accurate safeguards measurements of nuclear materials.  This activity also provides expertise to
sites requiring field support and in the enhancement of nuclear material control and accountability 
(MC&A) policy, and research and development needs.
The primary resource for performing nuclear material measurement activities is the New Brunswick 
Laboratory (NBL), located in Argonne, IL.  Funding provides for NBL to purchase base materials 
used for preparing certified reference materials and calibration standards; to purchase, operate, and 
maintain instruments and equipment used for certification and other safeguards measurements; and 
for the development of methods and performance criteria for nondestructive assay measurement of 
nuclear material.  NBL provides certified reference materials to users, and maintains accurate 
standards and comprehensive procedures to ensure that consistent results are obtained from various 
destructive and nondestructive analysis techniques, thereby ensuring that DOE’s nuclear materials 
accounts are based on defensible measured values. Funding also provides for the cost of facility
maintenance and upgrades related to activity operations and for radioactive waste management 
incurred for handling, storage, and processing waste to meet DOE, Federal, State, and local 
environmental regulations.
Global nuclear materials accountability activities provide for the maintenance and operation of the 
Nuclear Materials Management and Safeguards System (NMMSS).  NMMSS is an electronic 
information system comprised of software, hardware, procedures, and reports and meets the statutory 
requirements of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and international treaties.  NMMSS is 
the central component of the U.S. Government’s accounting system for the possession, use, and 
shipment of nuclear material within the United States and abroad.  NMMSS is funded jointly by 
DOE and the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and is used to collate, maintain, and 
report data regarding nuclear material inventories, material balances, and transactions of U.S. 
Government-owned, foreign obligated, and privately owned nuclear material.  Reports derived from 
NMMSS are provided to U.S. Government organizations including the NRC and the State 
Department, the International Atomic Energy Agency, and foreign governments that receive U.S.-
owned nuclear materials.  Nuclear material management and safeguards data from more than 700 
U.S. Government and commercial nuclear facilities is tracked on a “by site” basis.  NMMSS supports 
the detection, assessment, and reporting of loss, diversion, or theft of nuclear materials.  NMMSS 
supports implementation of the Design basis Threat Policy in the identification of attractive targets 
for adversary attack, thereby assisting in the prioritization, development, and deployment of 
protection for the most vulnerable assets.  Accounting for nuclear materials is required by DOE 
Order 470.4, Safeguards and Security Program through DOE Manual 470.4-6, Nuclear Material 
Control and Accountability (formerly DOE O 470 and DOE M 474.1-1A and -1B).

The primary tool developed to provide nuclear materials accountability within DOE at the site level 
is the Local Area Nuclear Material Accountability Software (LANMAS). LANMAS is an SSA-
developed tool designed specifically to provide DOE sites with a standardized application for 
tracking nuclear material by item and location.  The software application can be used on both stand-
alone and local area network computer systems.  LANMAS supports accurate and timely onsite 
nuclear material inventory information and is used, in combination with other site security elements, 
to account for, detect, assess, and report the theft or diversion of nuclear materials.  LANMAS also 
has the potential to be integrated with site processing operations aligned with the Department’s 
enterprise architecture to improve efficiencies and reduce costs associated with safeguarding and 
managing nuclear materials.  Information managed by this software is used to account for day-to-day
activities at the site level, perform corporate-level quality assurance activities regarding material
transactions, and provide timely, information regarding the location of material throughout the DOE 
complex for use in emergency response management. LANMAS demonstrates a cost savings for 
DOE by minimizing duplication of software development.
The primary tool for inventorying radioactive sealed source materials throughout the Department is 
the Radiological Source Registry and Tracking (RSRT) database. RSRT provides the Department 
with an inventory tool to meet international guidance for registering and inventorying high-risk
sealed sources and assists in the determination of potential radiological sabotage targets.  The 
database is updated annually through a Department-wide data call.  Information in the RSRT can be 
used to monitor the location and use of sealed sources; detect and act on discrepancies in inventory, 
assist in vulnerability studies and emergency response activities, and provide greater security and
management for high-risk radioactive sealed sources. The NRC is in the process of developing rules 
for the control and accountability of sealed sources, as prescribed in the Energy Policy Act of 2005.
RSRT is the current mechanism that will be used by DOE to report to the NRC when the final rules 
are promulgated.

activity by utilizing electronic information systems for the delivery of required security briefings and 
other security information.  Funding provides for monthly teleconferences, an annual workshop, and 
a group web site.
Information used throughout the DOE security complex regarding security issues related to policy 
implementation is maintained in the Safeguards and Security Information Management System, a 
centralized database that serves as the master repository of current and historical DOE security 
deficiencies, from both internal and external sources, and associated corrective actions.  This system 
allows for the trending and analysis of security issues in order to identify systemic security issues and 
areas that may require additional oversight, or indicators of continuing or future security concerns 
within DOE.  The database also maintains facility security ratings, a listing of facility security offices 
for more than 2,000 cleared DOE facilities, classified mailing addresses for over 500 facilities 
authorized to receive classified matter, and classified contracts and surveys.  Funding supports 
operational and basic maintenance of the database and upgrades to the secure communication 
hardware.  Information regarding incidents involving unauthorized disclosures and compromises of 
classified information is maintained in the Incident Tracking and Analysis Capability database.
Funding supports the operation of the system and routine trending and analysis reports for use by 
various departmental entities.  Funding also provides for field assistance activities associated with the 
continued rollout of remote incident tracking and analysis terminals at field locations.

which support the GPRA Units in carrying out their mission.  Security Investigations performs the 
following functions in support of the overall mission of the Office of Security and Safety Performance 
Assurance.
Benefits
This subprogram provides for the centralized management of access control authorizations (clearances)
that allow employees and contractors access to sensitive information, facilities, and material entrusted to 
DOE thus ensuring national security.  Background investigations are performed in accordance with DOE
Order 470.4, Safeguards and Security Program, August 26, 2005, which replaced DOE Order 472.1C 
Personnel Security Activities, March 25, 2003, by either the Federal Bureau of Investigation or the 
Office of Personnel Management, as required by law or Departmental regulations. The Accelerated 
Access Authorization Program provides a method for granting qualifying new DOE employees and 
contractors interim “Q” access authorizations within 21 days while the 150 to 300-day background 
investigation is completed.  This allows new hires to begin productive work while affording additional 
assurances that the national security is being safeguarded.  The management of access authorization data 
is performed in a cost effective, efficient, manner via the use of electronic databases and Internet capable 
tools that comprise the electronic DOE Integrated Security System (e-DISS+).  These electronic tools
support and track the adjudication process from the beginning to the disposition of the access 
authorization request.

This activity provides for the management of all aspects of access authorization data.  The process of 
investigating, granting, and subsequent management and tracking of access authorizations is data 
intensive and requires the maintenance of large amounts of data for long periods of time, both for 
personnel who are granted access authorizations and for those who are not.  The primary system for 
performing this function is the electronic DOE Integrated Security System (e-DISS+), which 
consists of a series of interrelated electronic databases and associated client applications and web 
pages that automate the processing and tracking of access authorization requests and integrate the 
access control process. An automated Applicant User Interface allows applicants to complete and 
submit their Questionnaire for National Security Positions (Standard Form-86) over a secure web-
based system.  The Personnel Security Interface facilitates the collection of SF-86 data for review 
and allows DOE security personnel to receive, process, review, and submit the information to OPM.
This process greatly reduces the amount of time spent on managing and preserving the integrity of 
the data as the information flows between physical locations and organizations.  The e-DISS+ also 
includes the Central Personnel Clearance Index database that maintains access authorization data at 
the site and national level.  The Visitor Access Database and Classified Visitor Control System 
contain data in centralized databases for nationwide access by DOE personnel and contractors 
concerning access authorizations and inter-site visits for use in providing access to facilities and 
information.  The e-DISS+ supports the President’s Management Agenda in the electronic 
Government initiative, but does not duplicate the e-Clearance authorization initiative managed by 
OPM.  Funding provides for the continued operation and maintenance, as well as modest upgrades in 
the functionality of these systems, and for the maintenance of system user information.

days rather than waiting the 150 to 300 days for the Single Scope Background Investigations to be 
completed while affording assurance that national security is safeguarded.  AAAP applicants 
voluntarily undergo a series of tests, including a drug screen, a psychological assessment, and a 
polygraph examination, in addition to a review of the applicants SF-86 and a National Agency 
Check with Credit.  The AAAP does not replace the Single Scope Background Investigations;
investigations continue even after the interim access authorization is granted. Funding provides for

Salaries and benefits for FY 2007 provide for 308 Federal full-time equivalents (FTEs) with the 
technical expertise needed to carry out the essential SSA mission.  The Federal staffing level is derived 
from the combined staffing from the New Brunswick Laboratory (NBL) (40), Office of the 
Departmental Representative to the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board (5), and the remainder of 
SSA (263). Based on a workforce analysis and skills evaluation performed by SSA, it was determined 
that there will be a reduction of 25 FTEs in FY 2006.  This reduction is also due to streamlining the 
efficiency of operations following the formation of SSA in December 2003, the significant program and 
organizational restructuring and realignments completed in April 2004, and a transfer of 1 FTE to the 
Office of the Chief Information Officer associated with the Cyber Forensics Laboratory. In FY 2007, 
4 FTEs will be transferred to the National Nuclear Safety Administration for the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization and Continuity of Operations activities. Salaries and benefit estimates are based on the 
economic assumptions provided by the Office of Management and Budget.  Funding for full-time
permanent employees includes salaries and other personnel benefits, such as cash incentive awards, 
lump sum payments, Senior Executive Service and other performance awards, and worker’s 
compensation, and provides for the skills and expertise required to carry out the mission of SSA.
Federal employees (40 FTEs) are also located at NBL in Argonne, IL.  NBL serves as the central 
authority for nuclear material safeguards measurements and measurement evaluations and is the U.S. 
Government’s certifying authority for nuclear reference materials.  NBL provides certified reference 
materials and maintains accurate standards and comprehensive procedures to ensure DOE’s nuclear 
materials accounts are based on defensible measured values; reducing costs associated with investigating 
discrepancies and supporting treaty compliance.  NBL personnel support DOE and other U.S. 
Government Agencies and Departments in global nonproliferation efforts by participating in the

programs; and assisting in verification of nuclear material nonproliferation program activities.  An A-76
Competitive Sourcing study of NBL was initiated in FY 2005.  The results of the study will be 
announced in March 2006.
Federal personnel at Headquarters (268 FTEs) perform the independent oversight mission, support the 
Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board liaison functions, and serve as the operational element for 
security policy, technology deployment, executive protection, and Headquarters security.  Activities 
include the security training mission at the National Training Center in Albuquerque, NM; plutonium, 
uranium, and special material control and accountability; classification and declassification operations; 
tracking of foreign national visits, assignments and travel; Headquarters security operations; executive 
protection operations; security investigations; Department-wide security policy, to include the 
development and issuance of security directives for the Department; and DOE Continuity of 
Government programs.  Staff members also serve on interagency working groups and task forces in the 
development of U.S. Government-wide security policy in the form of Executive Orders, National 
Security and Homeland Security Presidential Decisions, Directives, and other policy issuances.

SSA has analyzed its use of support services and has established specific criteria for its efficient use.
While SSA has some unique national-level experts, technical contractual services continue to be more 
practical and cost-effective.  The evolving need for national-level expertise in a multitude of disciplines
can best be met through the use of contractors who can rapidly respond to the continually changing skill 
mix required to perform security and independent oversight activities across the DOE complex.
Contractor support provides a practical and cost-effective method of providing a surge pool of personnel 
with technical expertise in a wide range of safety and security disciplines.  Support services are utilized 
as follows.

12,575
13,596
Independent oversight activities of security, cyber security, emergency management, and 
environment, safety, and health programs throughout the Department directly relate to DOE national 
security strategic and general goals.  Independent oversight appraisals are conducted to verify that 
the Department’s security interests are protected, that the Department can effectively respond to 
emergencies, and that site workers, the public, and the environment are protected from hazardous 
operations and materials.  These appraisals provide accurate, comprehensive information and 
analysis regarding the effectiveness, vulnerabilities, and trends of the Department’s security; cyber 
security; emergency management; environment, safety, and health programs; and other critical 
functions of interest to the Department Secretary, the Deputy Secretary, the Under Secretary, the 
Administrator of the National Nuclear Security Administration, Congressional committees, and other 
stakeholders, such as the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board.
As required by DOE Order 470.2B, Independent Oversight and Performance Assurance Program,
dated October 21, 2002, the independent appraisal function is performed by personnel 
organizationally independent of the DOE offices that develop and implement policies and programs 
and, therefore, can objectively observe and report on these policies and programs as they relate to 
departmental operations.  These appraisals complement but do not replace DOE line management’s 
responsibility for security and safety program oversight and self-assessments, as required by 
integrated security management and integrated safety management systems implemented throughout 
the Department.  The appraisal processes utilized are governed by documented, formal protocols 
addressing all phases of appraisal activities.  These processes are also conducive to changing 
conditions and the needs of the Department.
Additionally, SSA continues to be actively involved in the development of Department-level
directives that establish overarching principles for oversight and identify DOE oversight activities 
that involve assessing Federal and contractor performance.  These directives are closely linked to the 
Department’s response to Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board Recommendation 2004-1,
Oversight of Complex High-Hazard Nuclear Operations.
Funding provides for contracted national-level experts to complement the Federal staff, to 
implement the appraisal process, which emphasizes performance testing.  Appraisal personnel 
observe operations and conduct performance tests to validate the effectiveness of safety and security 
programs and policies.  Reports are developed documenting the assessment activities conducted, the 
results of those assessments, and opportunities for improvement or findings.  Unclassified appraisal 
reports and classified appraisal report titles are maintained on the SSA web site in order to share the 
information throughout the Department.  Classified reports are maintained in a document control

center and are available to authorized personnel upon request.  The final products of the appraisal 
process are corrective action plans, as required.  The corrective action plans are developed by the 
programs under review and are reviewed and commented on by SSA staff to ensure proposed 
corrective actions adequately address findings and other issues; and promote the protection of 
security interests, workers, the public, and the environment.
Events and activities that have an impact on security and safety are proactively evaluated and 
evaluation methods and procedures are continuously revised and refined to better evaluate the 
principal elements of the independent oversight program.

Security Appraisals.................................................
5,849
6,033

Security appraisals are conducted at DOE (primarily, National Nuclear Security Administration) 
sites that have significant amounts of special nuclear material, classified information, or other 
security interests.  The scope of the appraisals include: physical protection of special nuclear 
material, accountability of special nuclear material, protection of classified and sensitive 
information, personnel security, protective forces, foreign visits and assignments, and protection 
program management.  Performance tests are conducted using weapons simulation systems to 
perform realistic tactical security engagements between a specially trained composite adversary
force and the inspected site protection force to assess overall security performance effectiveness 
(e.g., force-on-force exercises).  These reviews have directly contributed to significant reductions 
in the recurrence of security issues, and effectively support the maintenance of a safe, secure, and 
reliable weapons stockpile.  As a direct result of the experiences and expertise developed, tools 
and information (e.g., handbooks, videotapes, and lessons learned) have been shared with 
numerous organizations within the Department.
SSA’s current safeguard and security independent oversight activities have been shaped by 
events over the recent past regarding use and management of controlled removable electronic 
media, revision to the Design Basis Threat Policy, and advancement of DOE Secretarial 
initiatives.  The effect of these events will be reflected in security independent oversight 
activities over the next several fiscal years.  SSA continues to review implemented procedures 
and processes for controlling accountable controlled removable electronic media and conducts 
site visits to assist in developing resource-efficient, sustainable protection strategies to support 
timely implementation of the revised Design Basis Threat Policy.  SSA will conduct more 
frequent evaluations and testing of sites with significant holdings of special nuclear materials, 
nuclear weapons, and sensitive information facilities.  SSA will also increase the number of 
force-on-force performance tests from 4 to 5 per year.  Training for the Composite Adversarial 
Team that acts as the opposing force during force-on-force exercises will continue semi-
annually.  Additionally, SSA will conduct special reviews and analyses to assess the 
effectiveness of site Design Basis Threat Policy implementation plans.  Insights on DOE security 
program strengths and weaknesses gained as a result of independent oversight activities will be 
published in lessons learned reports for distribution to security and senior departmental 
management.

Cyber security evaluations provide assurance that the confidentiality, integrity, and availability 
of DOE classified and unclassified information systems are protected through multi-facetted
evaluations of cyber security program performance, including regular announced inspections, 
unannounced testing, continuous scanning of the DOE Internet perimeter, and other special 
reviews.  Internal and external network penetration testing is conducted in support of inspection 
activities in order to fully understand a site’s cyber security protection posture.  Penetration 
testing focuses on identifying network vulnerabilities that could be exploited, evaluating the 
effectiveness of firewalls, evaluating intrusion detection and system monitoring capabilities, and 
evaluating other aspects of network security.  Cyber security assessments require the 
maintenance of a state-of-the-art cyber security testing network for external testing and a suite of 
deployable cyber security testing equipment for internal testing of DOE site networks.  Cyber 
security independent oversight activities also include programmatic reviews to evaluate essential 
management processes that are critical to an effective cyber security program.  These reviews 
assess the direction and sustainability of the program as well as to identify any underlying causes 
for weaknesses that are discovered during penetration testing.
SSA’s current cyber security independent oversight activities have been shaped by focus on 
compliance with Federal Information Security Management Act requirements, advancement of 
DOE Secretarial security initiatives, and protection of DOE information systems against ever 
increasing threats.  The effect of these events will be reflected in cyber security independent
oversight activities over the next several fiscal years.  SSA is responsible for conducting the 
annual evaluation of classified information systems security program, as required by Federal 
Information Security Management Act, for both DOE and the Office of Intelligence.  SSA also 
provides critical input to the DOE Office of Inspector General on the annual evaluation of 
unclassified information systems security program.  There are a number of Federal Information 
Security Management Act focus areas, such as certification and accreditation, which continue to 
influence the scope of SSA cyber security inspections.  In May 2004, the Secretary announced a 
series of initiatives to improve DOE security including one initiative focused on SSA cyber 
security testing activities that mandates an active unannounced penetration testing program for 
the Department, continuous scanning of the DOE network perimeter, and enhanced testing of 
DOE classified networks.  Finally, SSA continues to focus on protection of DOE information
systems across the breadth of the Department to ensure that the confidentiality, integrity, and 
availability of important systems are appropriately protected.  This includes cyber security 
assessments of critical infrastructure, national security, science, environmental protection, and 
other departmental sites.

response, emergency public information, and offsite interfaces by conducting limited scope 
performance tests and evaluating full-participation exercises at the inspected sites.  Additionally, 
reviews of crosscutting emergency management topics of increased concern in the heightened 
terrorist threat environment are performed.  Appraisal results have significantly contributed to 
improvements in emergency management readiness and response at individual sites, within 
program and field offices, and across the DOE complex.
Independent oversight of departmental emergency management program activities has been 
expanding to include a broader spectrum of reviews in consideration of the post 9/11 threat 
environment and the implications of the revised Design Basis Threat Policy.  At the site 
implementation level, new emergency management reviews will be conducted jointly with 
security force-on-force evaluations to test integrated incident command in response to 
malevolent acts, including response to the release of hazardous materials.  Joint reviews of site
environment, safety, and health programs will also be conducted to ensure they effectively 
support emergency response.  Cross-cutting special reviews will be expanded to evaluate 
capabilities required to meet the new directives for the National Response Plan and the National 
Incident Management System.  New reviews will be conducted to assess the Department’s 
national response assets capabilities in support of potential or actual radiological materials 
releases.  In partnership with line program management, lessons learned site visits will be 
conducted to share knowledge of effective program implementation practices, and to share 
independent oversight feedback to the Emergency Operations Training Academy to foster 
corporate-wide improvement.

Environment, safety, and health (ES&H) evaluations focus on Integrated Safety Management 
implementation; ES&H performance; and relevant ES&H topics such as radiation protection, 
criticality safety, industrial hygiene, and occupational medicine.  Integrated Safety Management 
reviews focus on management systems such as self-assessments, lessons learned, deficiency 
tracking, root cause analysis, and reporting of compliance deficiencies and events.  Periodic 
independent oversight is also performed of ES&H performance during all phases of major 
projects, such as construction, recovery, and stabilization of hazardous materials, 
decommissioning, and environmental restoration.  Environmental portions of inspections provide
independent evaluations of a wide variety of environmental protection and restoration activities, 
including the effectiveness of environmental programs in accordance with Executive Orders.
Reviews are conducted of selected areas of current interest (i.e., focus areas), such as compliance 
with the implementation of environmental management systems, corrective action management, 
and safety system oversight.  Also, reviews are conducted of selected essential systems to ensure 
that they can perform their safety functions.  As a result, these evaluations provide a significant 
benefit to the Department by improving safety and promoting adherence to applicable Federal 
and State regulations and DOE and industry standards in such areas as safety and health, 
radiation protection, waste management, and fire protection.
ES&H evaluations have evolved over the past several years to focus on persistent

implementation problems within DOE.  This process has proven to be an effective diagnostic 
tool to quickly and efficiently identify weaknesses in Integrated Safety Management, and 
provides a means to ensure timely and effective corrective actions are implemented.  SSA 
currently performs 6 ES&H evaluations each year, focusing on high hazard nuclear, and non-
nuclear radiological and industrial facilities.  The goal is to perform an evaluation at each of 
these facilities every 2 to 3 years.  Lower hazard facilities will be evaluated as resources permit 
or events dictate.  Sites with recurring weaknesses, high rates of accidents and injuries, or other 
special considerations may be reviewed more frequently.  In addition to the safety evaluations, 
SSA will conduct more focused reviews of special topic areas, such as safety system oversight,
lockout-tagout, chronic beryllium disease prevention, and environmental management.  These 
reviews may be conducted separately or incorporated into ES&H evaluations.  Results from 
ES&H evaluations and focused reviews will be summarized annually in a lessons learned report 
to safety and senior Department managers. In addition, special investigations maybe conducted 
to address as directed by the Secretary in important areas such as worker safety and health.

Special reviews and studies are performed of policies, programs, and their implementation in the 
field to identify program corrections.  These special reviews are often conducted in addition to 
regularly scheduled appraisal activities at the request of the Secretary and other senior 
departmental managers to examine issues derived from current events, e.g., the recent 
departmental stand-down of all operations involving accountable classified removable electronic 
media; and implementation of the revised Design Basis Threat Policy.  In addition, special 
review activities include reviews of issues not normally covered by ongoing independent 
oversight functions (i.e., security, cyber security, emergency management, and ES&H), e.g., 
Investigation of Worker Exposures and Medical Services at the Hanford Site and River 
Protection Project; and Limited Scope Small Business Review.  Finally, special reviews of 
crosscutting subjects, such as protective force, lock and key control, internet connectivity, 
chemical / biological agent use, and hoisting and rigging programs, are developed from site-
specific investigations to provide DOE senior management an overview of programs and 
associated issues across the entire Department.
The results of these special reviews and studies have been of particular interest to senior DOE 
managers and Congress, and their evaluation and analysis has resulted in substantial 
improvements to programs throughout DOE.

Department: 1) to respond to DNFSB safety recommendations and resolve agreed-upon safety 
issues; 2) to provide requested reports on nuclear safety issues; 3) to fully cooperate with the 
DNFSB; and 4) to provide ready access to such facilities, personnel, and information as the DNFSB 
considers necessary to carry out its responsibilities.  This includes technical evaluation and analysis 
of DNFSB safety and management issues providing direction and advice to line managers on 
addressing and resolving DNFSB issues, monitoring Department-wide performance in addressing 
and resolving DNFSB issues, and taking action to ensure the adequacy of DOE-wide performance.
Additional activities include preparing the statutorily required Annual Report to Congress on 
DNFSB activities; maintaining and improving the Department’s Safety Issues Management Systems
for DNFSB-related issues, commitments, and actions; providing monthly and quarterly analysis 
reports to senior DOE officials on the status of existing commitments to identify those that require 
additional management attention or action; and maintaining a web site that serves as the 
Department’s central repository of official DNFSB communications, making this information 
available to the public and to Department and contractor personnel complex-wide.
This activity also provides program guidance for Department-wide implementation of the 
Department’s Facility Representative Program.  This program includes approximately 200 DOE 
Facility Representatives who provide operational oversight at hazardous facilities at over 250 sites.
Activities include participating in site reviews, updating program guidance and requirements, 
reporting on performance, and hosting an annual workshop.
This activity prepares the statutorily required Annual Report to Congress on DNFSB activities.  The 
report includes statutory notification of any implementation plans requiring more than 1 year to 
complete.  DR prepares transmittal packages for all draft DOE rules, directives, and standards that 
fall within the DNFSB statutory authority for review and approval, and reviews DNFSB comments 
on DOE safety directives and resolves these comments with the responsible line managers so that 
final DOE rules, directives, and standards can be issued.
DR thoroughly reviews incoming DNFSB correspondence and outgoing DOE correspondence to 
identify safety and management issues that must be addressed by the Department.  DR identifies and 
supports DOE line managers and technical experts in evaluating identified safety and management
issues, determines corrective actions to resolve them, and provides direction and final review of the 
adequacy of corrective actions to resolve identified DNFSB safety and management issues.
DR maintains and improves the Department’s SIMS database for DNFSB-related issues, 
commitments, and actions.  This system currently contains over 500 active Department 
commitments and actions related to DNFSB recommendations, reporting requirements, and other 
correspondence.  On behalf of the Secretary, DR identifies the existence of DOE commitments to the 
DNFSB for inclusion in this database and obtains descriptive status of commitments on a monthly 
basis.  DR provides monthly and quarterly analysis reports to senior DOE officials on the status of 
existing commitments to identify those that require additional management attention or action.  The 
Safety Issues Management Systems database is password-protected and Internet-accessible from

throughout the Department.  Funding also provides for the maintenance of and improvements to 
public web sites on DOE/DNFSB correspondence and safety issues.  The main web site includes the 
Department’s central repository of official DNFSB communications and makes this information 
available to the public and to Department and contractor personnel complex-wide.  Annually, 250 to 
350 pieces of DNFSB/DOE correspondence are received and made available Department-wide via 
the Internet.  Over 4,000 documents are currently available on the web site in multiple file formats 
for user convenience.  Documents are posted in 1 to 3 business days to facilitate prompt, effective 
responses and corrective action.  The web site also provides DNFSB points-of-contact, DOE 
interface protocols and direction, and useful information about the DNFSB.  Funding also provides 
for the Facility Representative web site with associated technical knowledge base and training aids.

Other Related Expenses provides support required for Federal and contractor staff to accomplish the 
SSA mission.  Support includes the acquisition of security support and communications equipment, 
Secretarial mandated information technology support, Extended Common Integrated Technology 
Environment, Working Capital Fund services, and training for Federal employees.  The specific security 
support and communications purchases for SSA include the purchase of protective gear, weapons, and 
communication devices.
The Extended Common Integrated Technology Environment initiative gathers the common information
technology services that were previously managed separately, and turns the management and oversight 
of these services into one large-scale effort.  The initiative is designed to be a one-stop-shop for all 
common information technology system and service that brings security, service, efficiency, and scale to 
these projects.  The information technology investments support the Federal staff at Headquarters by 
providing support and maintenance of hardware, software, hotline, and other desktop maintenance.
Information technology hardware, connectivity, and support costs are based on a seat count and level of 
service requested by SSA.
The maintenance of information technology systems exclusive to SSA is also part of this budget.  The 
Classified Local Area Network is part of the consolidated infrastructure initiative.  It includes a Secret 
Restricted Data network that supports SSA Headquarters users.  The Secret Internet Protocol Router 
Network is part of the consolidated infrastructure initiative.  It provides access to the Department of 
Defense classified network to effect coordination between the Departments.
Other Related Expenses also provides funding for the Working Capital Fund based on guideline 
estimates issued by the Working Capital Fund Manager. The Working Capital Fund was established in 
FY 1997 to allocate the cost of common administrative services to the recipient organizations; it covers 
building occupancy and alterations, computer and telephone infrastructure and usage, mail service, 
copying, printing and graphics, procurement closeouts, supplies, online learning, computer network 
support, and payroll processing.  Funding also provides training for Federal staff (including tuition costs

Strategic Context 
Following publication of the Administration’s National Energy Policy, the Department developed a 
Strategic Plan that defines its mission, four strategic goals for accomplishing that mission, and seven 
general goals to support the strategic goals.  As stated in the Departmental Strategic Plan, DOE’s 
Strategic and General Goals will be accomplished not only through the efforts of the major program 
offices in the Department but with additional effort from offices which support the programs in carrying 
out the mission.  The Office of Environment, Safety and Health performs critical functions which 
directly support the mission of the Department.  These functions include: 
�
Environment – Ensure the protection of the environmental resources affected by DOE activities. 
�
Safety – Operate to industry standards where they are relevant and available and provide regulations 
for those operations that are unique to DOE; perform at a level equal to or better than private 
industry.
�
Health – Promotes the health and safety of DOE’s workers and communities surrounding DOE sites; 
to develop comprehensive and effective safety and health policy for DOE workplace hazards, and to 
conduct studies and medical screening to understand the effects of radiation, chemical and other 
potential hazards of DOE operations on humans. 
�
Corporate Performance Assessment – Provide environment, safety and health performance trending, 
analysis, and measures to ensure DOE’s ES&H goals are accomplished.  Performance trending and 
analysis also focuses resources and senior management attention on significant and emerging issues.
Ensure operating experience, including lessons learned and best practices, are identified and shared 
throughout the DOE to continuously improve performance and prevent adverse events from 
recurring.  Improve the quality of worker radiation exposure measurements, thus helping to prevent 
future radiation exposure related litigation and compensation programs, through implementation of 
the 10 CFR 835 required DOE Laboratory Accreditation Program.  Provide the corporate framework 
to ensure quality assurance is properly applied to all DOE operations and that work is performed 
safely and reliably.  Provide the necessary policy, guidance, and corporate direction.  Provide the 
Mixed Analyte Performance Evaluation Program to ensure quality in environmental measurements 
in support of DOE cleanup activities.  The Information Management programs ensure that 
information technology is acquired and information resources are managed in a manner that 
implements the policies and procedures of legislation and the President’s Management Agenda. 
�
Nuclear/Worker Safety Enforcement - Implement DOE’s congressional mandates to investigate 
safety conditions or events and apply enforcement sanctions to contractors for unsafe actions or 
conditions that violate DOE nuclear safety and worker safety requirements for protecting workers 
and the public.
�
Nuclear Safety Research – Develops, prioritizes and approves an annual nuclear safety research plan 
that meets the needs of the DOE Energy, Science and Environment (ESE) Central Technical 
Authority (CTA) and the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) CTA, and that takes

the DOE; and participates in and represents DOE at national and international nuclear safety 
research organizations and their activities. 
Mission
The mission of the EH is to provide the corporate leadership, performance goals, assistance, policies, 
programs and feedback to enable the Department of Energy to excel in mission performance while 
achieving excellence in safety and environmental stewardship. 
Environment, Safety and Health performs critical functions which directly support the mission of the 
Department.  These functions include providing technical support and assistance; assessing 
performance; ensuring quality assurance is properly applied; developing corporate policy, guidance, 
rules, orders and standards; and supporting an effective collaborative radiological and non radiological 
health studies program. 
Benefits
DOE works to identify health concerns, investigate health effects from similar operations, integrate new 
occupational health understanding into DOE operations, and support the Department of Labor in 
implementing the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act.  EH leverages 
its resources and personnel to provide DOE’s line management programs with essential environment, 
safety and health performance expectations: environment, safety and health performance measures and 
analysis; management tools to promote the safe conduct of work, including the Department’s Quality 
Assurance Program; and guidance for the protection of the environment in and around DOE sites.  
Integral to the Department’s success is EH’s skill in fostering increased awareness and providing 
support to line management throughout the Department, using open communications, coordinating with 
other industry and governmental organizations, and performance feedback on environmental, safety, and 
health activities, to provide the safety infrastructure that allows for and promotes the safe and 
environmentally responsible conduct of work.  The Department of Energy Laboratory Accreditation 
Program promotes worker confidence that work is being accomplished safely, and provides the quality 
assurance documentation that could help prevent future worker radiation exposure litigation or 
additional worker exposure compensation programs.

and the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board.  In addition, Headquarters senior managers conduct in-
depth reviews of cost and schedule to ensure activities are on-track and within budget.
Significant Policy or Program Shifts  
Environment, Safety and Health significant policy and program shifts are as follows: 
�
On December 17, 2004, in response to Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board Recommendation 
2004-1, former Deputy Secretary for Energy McSlarrow directed the following organizational 
changes for the Department to better focus departmental awareness and management of issues 
related to nuclear safety.  To enhance the focus of environment, safety, and health in the Department, 
the Office of Environment, Safety and Health (EH) is now reporting directly to the Deputy Secretary 
of Energy.  EH is the corporate environmental, safety and health (ES&H) officer and responsible for 
making ES&H policy and providing technical interpretations of it.   
�
In FY 2006, the Office of Environmental Management will transfer the management of High 
Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filter testing service responsibilities to the Office of Environment, 
Safety and Health.  Financial responsibility will transfer in FY 2007. This Quality Assurance 
function ensures HEPA filters used at DOE’s nuclear facilities meet strict criteria to ensure public 
and worker safety and implements a Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board commitment to test 
100 percent of all HEPA filters prior to use in defense nuclear facilities.   
�
The Office of Environment, Safety and Health needs to significantly strengthen the Department’s 
Operating Experience Program to meet a formal commitment to the Defense Nuclear Facilities 
Safety Board.  This is a critical aspect of the Department’s safety management system for operations 
feedback and improvement.

Experience program that meets Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board (DNFSB) 2004-1 
commitments; significantly improves DOE/contractor awareness and resolution of operational safety 
issues that are generic or crosscut DOE; issue actionable information that will improve DOE and 
contractor worker safety and their day-to-day performance; and monitor and evaluate the effectiveness 
of contractor actions that use Operating Experience information.  This program is also responsible for 
the DOE Suspect/Counterfeit Items identification and investigation process which also supports 
Department of Justice and other Federal Agency investigations of related fraud.  This activity is an 
ongoing high priority commitment made to the DNFSB by the Secretary.
The Quality Assurance Program was established in FY 2003 to address corporate quality assurance 
issues identified by the General Accounting Office, Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board, and other 
quality assurance issues in the Department.  The Office of Quality Assurance Programs provides DOE 
corporate leadership that includes quality assurance information, corporate policy and guidance, and 
certification to support DOE mission accomplishment across the DOE complex and manages the Central 
Registry to support effective configuration and control of safety-related Software Toolbox Codes.  This 
program establishes requirements and policies to support existing activities such as High Efficiency 
Particulate Air (HEPA) filter testing, central registry for safety related computer software, and the DOE 
Self-Assessment Certification Program.

In FY 2006, the Office of Environmental Management will transfer the management of HEPA filter 
testing services responsibilities to the Office of Environment, Safety and Health.  Financial 
responsibility will transfer in FY 2007.  The Filter Test Facility (FTF) will improve the Department’s 
quality assurance function to serve all Departmental programs.  DOE has committed to conduct 100 
percent independent testing of HEPA filters installed in safety systems (safety class and safety 
significant) and habitability systems.  The Office of Environmental Management FTF operations 
resulted in an average of 2,600 filters tested annually from DOE nuclear facilities.  The FTF operation is 
necessary because of the critical nature of the filter usage in DOE facilities in mitigating radioactive 
exposure to the public, workers and the environment.  DOE-STD-3020-97, Specifications for HEPA 
Filters Used by DOE Contractors, requires that each filter be tested by both the manufacturer and FTF. 
Information Management is a critical component of corporate safety programs. The program manages 
and directs defense-related information activities to maximize the sharing and efficient use of data and 
information to meet the requirements of Federal regulations and legislation as well as the President’s 
Management Agenda (PMA) initiative “Expanded Electronic Government”.  This program provides 
both web pages and web-based database systems including access to the EH Corporate Reporting 
Systems (Occurrence Reporting and Processing System and the Computerized Accident and Illness 
Systems) as well as mission-specific systems.  These systems will be re-engineered for efficiency by 
consolidating existing databases and utilizing the latest technological capabilities to distribute 
information, including health studies communications management capability and web-based health 
studies status.  Further enhancement of the EH website with portal and workflow tools will enable EH to 
adhere to new OMB guidelines on Federal Website Administration and to support the newly-established 
Federal Health Line of Business.
To address immediate ES&H issues in the Department, the Facility Safety Program performs 
evaluations including accident investigations, facility authorizations bases, and safety allegations.  
Special safety reviews are conducted for nuclear hazards, criticality safety, seismic analysis, fire 
protection, occupational and construction safety, emergency operations, facility design, and the startup 
and restart of facilities.  
Safety Basis Corporate Support provides technical support for effective implementation of safety 
regulations (e.g., 10 CFR 830) for facility design, construction, operation, and decommissioning.  
Activities includes support of Critical Decision for nuclear facilities under design or major modification; 
support to RW on design and safety review of Yucca Mountain geological repository project; review of 
safety bases for nuclear facilities in operation and decommissioning phases including high hazard 
facilities such as ATR and HFIR; support for review of accident analysis of Environmental Impact 
Statements; evaluation of Unreviewed Safety Questions, and publication of lessons learned reports; and 
other studies or reviews as requested. 
EH conducts Type A investigations for the more serious incidents occurring within the DOE Complex, 
and reviews Type B investigation reports for investigations conducted by line program elements for less 
serious incidents.  Inconsistencies observed in Type B investigations have highlighted the need for the 
office to conduct independent programmatic oversight during selected Type B Accident Investigations

and to conduct training courses for Type A and B Accident Investigation Boards and Chairpersons to 
qualify those personnel to perform investigations when needed. 
Readiness Reviews are conducted at Category 1, 2, and 3 nuclear facilities prior to authorizing the 
startup or restart of those facilities.  As the Office of Primary Interest for the Readiness Review process, 
EH and the DNFSB staff have identified inconsistencies and deficiencies in process implementation 
across the complex.  Consequently, additional efforts will be focused on these areas before they result in 
a major site incident or become the basis for a new DNFSB Recommendation.  Based on current line 
program projections, the office will participate as team members or in Independent Reviews during a 
number of ORRs/RAs, will sponsor ORR Team Member/Team Leader training sessions, and will 
provide technical support to line program management.  The office will also draft revision “D” of DOE 
Order 425.1C and associated Standard 3006-2000. 
The Office of Facility Authorization Bases serves as the Dam Safety Coordinator for DOE.  Under the 
provisions of a Memorandum of Agreement between DOE and the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission (FERC), the FERC inspectors provide safety inspections of dams and other water 
impoundment structures owned by DOE across the DOE complex. 
The EH Enforcement program carries out the statutory mandate of the Price-Anderson Amendments Act 
of 1988 to enforce compliance with the Code of Federal Regulations for nuclear safety requirements at 
DOE sites and enforcement of worker safety.
Corporate Safety Programs also includes funding for the Department of Energy Laboratory 
Accreditation Program and the Analytical Services Program (run by the Radiological and Environmental 
Sciences Laboratory) as follows: 
 Radiological and Environmental Sciences Lab............. 
4,174

The Radiological and Environmental Sciences Laboratory (RESL) is DOE’s Federal reference 
laboratory that conducts performance evaluation and accreditation activities, provides technical support 
and measurement, and quality assurance methodologies to programs such as the DOE Laboratory 
Accreditation Program, and the Mixed Analyte Performance Evaluation Program.  These programs act 
as insurance policies against potential radiation exposure or D&D litigation or future worker 
compensation programs.  The responsibility to operate RESL was transferred from EM to EH in FY 
2004.
 Analytical Services Program.......................................... 
1,309
1,296

The Analytical Services Program ensures that environmental analytical laboratory data is of high quality 
and reliability and assures that analytical data is technically and legally defensible.  The program 
implements DOE’s Consolidated Audit Program thereby reducing redundant field audits of commercial 
analytical laboratories and Treatment, Storage & Disposal Facilities, resulting in significant cost savings 
for the Government.

On December 23, 2004, the Secretary signed the Department’s Implementation Plan in response to 
DNFSB Recommendation 2004-1.  DOE has committed to enhance the nuclear safety research function 
within the Department. 
The Secretary formally established that the Office of Environment, Safety and Health has primary 
responsibility for the nuclear safety research function.  EH has been formally assigned the following 
roles and responsibilities: establish the Office of Nuclear Safety Research; initiate the necessary 
activities to develop, prioritize and approve an annual nuclear safety research plan that meets the needs 
of the DOE Central Technical Authorities; implement the annual nuclear safety research plan after 
approval by the Assistant Secretary; identify changes in DOE directives and standards based on nuclear 
safety results; maintain adequate numbers of technically competent personnel necessary to fulfill nuclear 
safety research responsibilities; participate in and represent DOE at national and international nuclear 
safety research organizations and their activities; and respond to DNFSB Recommendation 2004-1 on 
nuclear safety research management. 
The Office of Nuclear Safety Research plans to implement the following functions and activities:  
describe the interfaces between the nuclear safety research program and other organizations (e.g., 
Program Secretarial Officers, sites, CTA(s)); determine required technical area staffing needs; establish 
the safety research assessment and prioritization criteria and guidance; initiate the process of identifying, 
prioritizing, and executing safety-related research and development; identify nuclear safety research 
needs; review and evaluate operating experiences and line oversight findings as potential sources of 
nuclear safety research needs; integrate existing nuclear safety research being performed both inside and 
outside the DOE; fund specific nuclear safety research projects/efforts; and prepare and issue an annual 
nuclear safety research report for approval by the Assistant Secretary for EH.  During FY 2007, EH will 
also conduct a gap analysis on existing nuclear safety research activities throughout DOE, the Nuclear 
Regulatory Commission (NRC), and elsewhere to determine the appropriate size and focus for this 
nuclear research program. 
The Office of Nuclear Safety Research will technically and programmatically lead each research project.  
This will include clearly defining the scope of each research project; developing schedules with 
intermediate milestones; and reviewing/verifying the research findings, including use of peer review 
where applicable.

Description
The Office of Health supports five major program areas: the Former Worker Program (a nationwide 
program of medical screening to identify work related health affects); Domestic Health Studies (to 
investigate and identify work related injury and illness in the DOE worker population and populations 
surrounding DOE sites); International Health Studies (support for ongoing radiation health effects 
research in Russia, Spain, and Japan, as well as health care and resettlement activities in the Marshall 
Islands); Worker Safety and Health and Occupational Medicine Programs (to publish DOE worker 
safety and health and occupational medicine program performance expectations and promote preventive 
medicine), and Illness and Injury Surveillance program for current workers.
Benefits
The benefits of these projects and programs include discovery and documenting health effects outcomes 
that provide the scientific basis for national and international worker protection policy and standards.
These radiation protection standards and practices, in turn, provide levels of protection appropriate for 
the risk posed to workers by hazards present at DOE sites.

This request funds Public Laws 99-239 and 108-188, the Compact of Free Association between the U.S. 
and Republic of the Marshall Islands.  The Health program also includes a special medical care program 
for a small cohort of radiation–exposed individuals in the Marshall Islands and supports field science 
and radiological monitoring to assist decision-making on the resettlement of the displaced Atoll 
populations.  In FY 2006 and FY 2007, the medical program will continue to provide annual 
examinations and cancer care, under the auspices of a new medical care provider, using a more cost 
effective approach; several major environmental missions to Bikini, Enewetak, and Rongelap Atolls will 
collect samples to assist atolls in resettlement decision-making. In FY 2007, there will be an advance 
contingent of resettled persons (around 150-200) at Rongelap Atoll and DOE’s program will provide 
whole-body counting and plutonium analyses for this population. Whole-body technologies will 
continue to be the centerpiece of the DOE’s environmental/radiological monitoring program at Majuro, 
Enewetak, & Rongelap.

The Former Worker Program supports the Office of Health Studies’ mission and strategic response 
by offering specialized medical screening by external teams of health experts to former workers who 
may have been exposed to hazardous materials as a result of their work at DOE sites.  Participants 
with significant findings are referred to their personal physicians for further attention, thus 
promoting early detection and intervention of occupational illnesses, and in some cases, submission 
of workers compensation claims under the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation 
Program Act (EEOICPA).  In FY 2006, the Former Workers Program continued an expansion of 
services initiated in FY 2005 to workers not already covered by the original medical screening 
projects through a combination of new regional projects and a new national supplemental care 
screening program.  In FY 2007, DOE will have implemented program enhancements within this 
congressionally mandated program to ensure the best and most cost-effective service to the largest 
number of former workers.  The Radiation Emergency Accident Center/Training Site (REAC/TS) 
maintains the capability to provide rapid response medical expertise and training to address 
radiological accidents.  In FY 2006, REAC/TS reinstitutes the capability to conduct cytogenetic 
studies to be able to quickly and accurately determine an individual’s radiation dose in the event of a 
radiological or dirty bomb event.  In FY 2007, it is expected that REAC/TS will be certified as a 
reference cytogenetic biodosimetry laboratory and organize, provide training and quality assurance 
for a national consortium of clinical laboratories that will be able to provide analyses in the event of 
a radiological/nuclear incident.

DOE funds the Department of Health and Human Services to conduct health studies and public 
health activities relevant to DOE workers and residents of communities neighboring DOE sites 
across the United States.  These activities are conducted by the National Institute for Occupational 
Safety and Health (NIOSH), the National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH), and the Agency 
for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) through three interagency agreements.  In FY 
2006, NIOSH communicated results to workers concerning four studies at five DOE sites.  Study 
results provide information that is designed to enhance the understanding of risks associated with 
radiation-induced health effects to over 800,000 workers.  In FY 2006, NCEH concluded an 
historical environmental dose reconstruction at one of DOE’s major production sites that evaluated 
the risk to the public of past releases of radiation and chemicals in communities around DOE sites.  
Results of historical dose reconstructions are used to estimate exposure-related health risks.  In FY 
2006, ATSDR finalized seven out of eight public health assessments of the Oak Ridge Reservation.
In FY 2007, NIOSH will complete a worker mortality study at Fernald, as well as a study that 
identifies and describes potential external and internal radiation exposures in plutonium workers at 
two DOE sites.   NCEH will complete a record review of Los Alamos National Laboratory, the last 
major DOE production site, to determine if an environmental dose reconstruction is warranted; and 
ATSDR will publish final Public Health Assessments for the Savannah River Site and the Oak Ridge 
facilities.   
� Epidemiological Studies............................................

Epidemiologic Studies collect both health and exposure data to document and demonstrate effects of 
radiation and other hazards to current DOE workers and the public and to validate current 
Departmental protection policies.  The Illness and Injury Surveillance Program (IISP) evaluates 
potential health impacts of DOE operations on workers by monitoring the health of current 
contractor workers at 14 participating DOE sites.  In FY 2007, capabilities to more rapidly perform 
disease outbreak investigations will be enhanced for quicker identification of health concerns in need 
of immediate attention.  The Comprehensive Epidemiologic Data Resource (CEDR) is an electronic 
data base which allows investigators access to data from studies funded by DOE.  The U.S. Uranium 
and Transuranium Registries (USTUR) provides independent, continuous improvement in DOE’s 
ability to estimate internal doses attributable to intake of long-lived radioactive materials by studying 
the distribution and possible biological effects of plutonium and other heavy metals in voluntarily 
donated human tissues.  In FY 2006, USTUR will use its data to refine dosimetry models to account 
for wounds and effects of chelation therapy.  In FY 2007, criteria for standardization of bioassay and 
health physics databases will be developed for international use. The viability of stored USTUR 
tissue will be assessed for possible use in cellular/genetic studies.

individual (versus group) past radiation doses for members of communities surrounding Mayak.  In 
FY 2007, researchers will have published new data on the radiation dose and cancer risk from 
inhaled plutonium. 
Under a binational agreement the DOE and the Government of Spain jointly sponsor the Palomares 
Program.  The goals of the program are to provide medical surveillance of exposed population and 
environmental monitoring of the area of plutonium contamination due to a USAF aircraft accident 
over Palomares, Spain, 1966.  DOE and the National Cancer Institute jointly sponsor studies to 
determine adverse health effects from exposure to radiological contamination following the 
aftermath of the Chernobyl Accident in 1986.  In FY 2006, the final planned data collection cycle for 
the thyroid and leukemia studies will be completed.  In FY 2007, the analysis and several 
publications from the thyroid and leukemia studies will be completed.

Preface
During FY 2007, the Department continues its efforts to reduce risk to human health and the 
environment at its contaminated sites and manage its pension and benefit responsibilities for former 
contractor personnel.  By conducting the long-term surveillance and maintenance of remediated sites 
and ensuring pension and benefit continuity, the Office of Legacy Management allows Environmental 
Management to concentrate on further risk reduction and site closure. 
Within the Energy and Water, Other Defense Activities appropriation, the Office of Legacy 
Management (LM) has one program: Legacy Management. 
This Overview will describe Strategic Context, Mission, Benefits, Strategic Goals, and Funding by 
General Goals.  These items together put the appropriation in perspective.  The Annual Performance 
Results and Targets, Means and Strategies, and Validation and Verification sections address how the 
goals will be achieved and how performance will be measured.  Finally, this Overview will address 
Significant Program Shifts. 
Strategic Context 
Following publication of the Administration’s National Energy Policy, the Department developed a 
Strategic Plan that defines its mission, four strategic goals for accomplishing that mission, and seven

FY 2007 Congressional Budget
general goals to support the strategic goals.  Each appropriation has developed quantifiable goals to 
support the general goals.  Thus, the “goal cascade” is the following: 
Department Mission � Strategic Goal (25 yrs) � General Goal (10-15 yrs) � Program Goal (GPRA 
Unit) (10-15 yrs) 
To provide a concrete link between budget, performance, and reporting, the Department developed a 
“GPRA Unit” concept.  Within DOE, a GPRA Unit defines a major activity or group of activities that 
support the core mission and aligns resources with specific goals.  Each GPRA Unit has completed or 
will complete a Program Assessment Rating Tool (PART).  A unique program goal was developed for 
each GPRA Unit.  A numbering scheme has been established for tracking performance and reporting. 
The goal cascade accomplishes two things.  First, it ties major activities for each program to successive 
goals and, ultimately, to DOE’s mission.  This helps ensure the Department focuses its resources on 
fulfilling its mission.  Second, the cascade allows DOE to track progress against quantifiable goals and 
to tie resources to each goal at any level in the cascade.  Thus, the cascade facilitates the integration of 
budget and performance information in support of the GRPA and the President’s Management Agenda 
(PMA).
Mission
The mission of the Office of Legacy Management is to manage the department’s post-closure 
responsibilities and ensure the future protection of human health and the environment.   This Office has 
control and custody for legacy lands, structures, and facilities and is responsible for maintaining them at 
levels suitable for their long-term use. 
Benefits
The greatest benefit of the Office of Legacy Management is to serve as a visible demonstration of the 
Department’s resolve to honor its responsibilities for the communities near its remediated facilities and 
for the former contractor work force. 
The Office of Legacy Management programs provide benefits to the Department following mission 
change or site closure.  For sites where cleanup is completed, Legacy Management programs ensure that 
the remediation measures implemented during closure are protecting human health and the environment, 
that labor responsibilities for the contractor work force are being satisfied, and that other Departmental 
legacy responsibilities are met.  By managing the real and personal property assets that remain after 
cleanup and closure, Legacy Management helps the Department reduce the magnitude of its physical 
resource management, the costs associated with such management, and actively promotes the beneficial 
reuse of those mission excess properties. 
Strategic, General, and Program Goals 
The Department’s Strategic Plan identifies four strategic goals (one each for defense, energy, science, 
and environmental aspects of the mission plus seven general goals that tie to the strategic goals.  The 
Other Defense Activities appropriation supports the following goal: 
Environment Strategic Goal:  To protect the environment by providing a responsible resolution to the 
environmental legacy of the Cold War and by providing for the permanent disposal of high-level 
radioactive waste.

Legacy Management/ 
Overview
FY 2007 Congressional Budget
General Goal 6, Environmental Management:  Accelerate cleanup of nuclear weapons manufacturing 
and testing sites, completing cleanup of 108 contaminated sites by 2025. 
The programs funded within the Other Defense Activities appropriation have one Program Goal that 
contributes to the General Goal in the “goal cascade”.  This goal is: 
Program Goal 06.26.00.00:  Legacy Management – By 2015, the Office of legacy Management will be 
responsible for:  the cost effective management of land, structures, facilities and/or records for over 120 
sites; employee benefits for the Department’s former contractor work force at seven sites; and the 
disposal of real property at five sites.
Contribution to General Goal
Within the Program Goal for the Legacy Management program, there are four subgoals that contribute 
to the general goal.  These subgoals are: 
�
Protect human health and the environment through effective and efficient long-term surveillance and 
maintenance – Activities associated with this subgoal contribute to the general goal by managing the 
long-term surveillance and maintenance at sites where remediation has been essentially completed, 
allowing the Environmental Management program to concentrate its efforts on continuing to 
accelerate cleanup and site closure resulting in reduced risks to human health and the environment 
and reduced landlord costs.
�
Preserve, protect, and make accessible legacy records and information – These activities assist the 
other activities by providing a central records management capability.  This work directly supports 
the administration of the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act 
(EEOICPA) and is responsive to Freedom of Information Act and Privacy Act requests.  This 
enables more efficient operation of the other activities and is needed to defend the Department 
against future liability claims. 
�
Support an effective and efficient work force structured to accomplish Departmental missions and 
assure contractor worker pension and medical benefits – The Legacy Management program manages 
the Department’s labor relations and oversees some pension and benefit programs to meet the 
Department’s contractual commitments.  By managing these activities, the Office of Legacy 
Management enables the Office of Environmental Management to focus on further risk reduction by 
remediating other sites. 
�
Manage legacy land and assets, emphasizing protective real and personal property reuse and 
disposition – These activities promote more efficient management of remediated resources.  This 
allows more resources to be focused on further risk reduction.

Means and Strategies 
The Legacy Management Program will use various means and strategies to achieve its program goal.  
However, various external factors may impact the ability to achieve the goal.  The program also 
performs collaborative activities to help meet its goal. 
The Department will implement the following means: 
�
Long-term surveillance and maintenance will be performed in accordance with the regulatory 
decisions for each site.  Activities range from maintaining records to routine inspections and 
maintenance at sites where remediation measures are substantially completed. 
�
Adequate staffing will be maintained to oversee the program.  A large portion of the surveillance 
and maintenance and payment of the contractor pensions and benefits will be performed by 
contractors.
The Department will implement the following strategies: 
�
The Office of Legacy Management (LM) will only accept responsibility for sites where remediation 
has been substantially completed. 
The following external factors could affect LM’s ability to achieve its strategic goal: 
�
Significant changes in remedy performance could cause the site to be returned to EM for further 
remediation. 
In conducting the program’s surveillance and maintenance functions, LM performs the following 
collaborative activities: 
�
Evaluation of remedy performance, as determined by surveillance and maintenance activities, is 
coordinated with regulators, local communities, and other stakeholders. 
Validation and Verification 
The Department is operating a performance tracking system to measure performance.  The Office of the 
Chief Financial Officer has developed action plans for the primary functions.  Quarterly updates for sites 
where surveillance and maintenance has been conducted are reported using an automated system. 
For payments of medical benefits or other activities not tracked by the automated system, the Office of 
Legacy Management will obtain quarterly updates to judge progress of the programs.   
The Legacy Management program has not performed a Program Assessment Rating Tool (PART) 
evaluation to date but such a review and the measures resulting from it would also provide verification.  
The observed results of surveillance and maintenance activities will be documented as annual inspection 
and compliance reports and retained as long as specified in Federal requirements for records retention. 
To validate and verify program performance, LM will conduct various internal and external reviews and 
audits.  LM’s programmatic activities are subject to continuing reviews by the Congress, the

Government Accountability Office, the Department’s Inspector General, the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, state environmental and health agencies, and 
the Department’s Office of Engineering and Construction Management.  Additionally, LM Headquarters 
senior management staff conduct quarterly, in-depth reviews of cost, schedule, and scope to ensure 
projects are on-track and within budget. 
Significant Policy or Program Shifts 
�
By the start of FY 2007, the Office of Environmental Management (EM) will have completed active 
cleanup of several major sites throughout the Department of Energy complex.  Management of these 
sites will be transferred to the Office of Legacy Management (LM).  Management activities will 
include legacy functions of long-term surveillance and maintenance, long-term response actions, 
oversight and management of pension and benefit payments for former contractor retirees, and 
records management.  The cumulative effect of these transfers will result in an increase of the LM 
budget by approximately 150 percent.  However, this increase in the LM budget will be matched by 
a corresponding decrease in the EM budget.
-
The largest transfer will be for the Rocky Flats site near Denver, CO.  Active cleanup will be 
completed and all other activities except for legacy function at this major site have ended.  At 
this site, LM will be managing all activities identified above. 
-
The Fernald Site near Cincinnati, OH, is another major transfer.  Like Rocky Flats, active 
cleanup will be completed and LM will be managing all the legacy functions identified above.  
-
A group of sites known collectively as the Nevada offsites, will be also be a major transfer.  The 
sites involved in this category are:  Amchitka site, AK; Rio Blanco and Rulison sites, CO; 
Gasbuggy and Gnome-Coach sites, NM; Salmon site, MS; and Project Shoal and Central 
Nevada Test Area, NV.  LM will be managing the legacy functions of long-term surveillance 
and management, long-term response actions, and records management for these sites.  There 
are no pension or benefit payments involved for any of these sites. 
�
At the same time that the program magnitude is significantly increasing, the Office of Legacy 
Management (LM) is involved in an internal evaluation of its own management needs.  LM is 
evaluating the anticipated work load from the increased activities and its existing skill mix in an 
effort to effectively manage its activities.  So far, this review has resulted in significant efficiencies 
for FY 2007 from FY 2006, despite the increase in the program scope and magnitude.   
�
To accommodate the records management functions, the FY 2007 request supports the centralization 
of Legacy Archives and Information activities from various sites across the country to a single 
location to ensure a more streamlined management approach.

The Grand Junction Office is located in western Colorado.  The oversight of the long-term surveillance 
and maintenance program at sites distributed throughout the Western states is the staff’s primary 
function.  The long-term surveillance and maintenance activities managed from this office include 
environmental monitoring, long-term treatment of contaminants, maintaining site security, and asset 
disposition.  During FY 2007, in addition to surveillance and maintenance activities, preparation for 
transferring the Mound site from Environmental Management to Legacy Management will also occur. 
Morgantown Office 
The Morgantown Office is located in Morgantown, WV.  Program functions that are the focus of staff at 
that location include long-term surveillance and maintenance activities in the Eastern and Midwestern 
states and, beginning in FY 2007, legacy archives and information management activities to support the 
missions of the Office of Legacy Management.  During FY 2005 and FY 2006, design, site selection, 
land acquisition, and construction of a records storage facility were major work elements.   
Mound Plant 
The Mound Plant is one of the facilities targeted by the Office of Environmental Management for 
closure in FY 2007.  Successful site cleanup will result in the closure and turnover of 24 buildings and 
306 acres to the Miamisburg-Mound Community Improvement Corporation for private sector 
development. 
Pinellas Plant 
The Pinellas Site is a former weapons facility located in Pinellas, FL, which is in the Tampa-St. 
Petersburg metropolitan area.  The facility has been completely closed and the property sold to the local 
community reuse organization.  The Legacy Management program provides pension and benefits 
payments for the former contractor work force as well as assisted the community reuse organization as a 
focal point to stabilize the local economy.   A portion of the funding in FY 2005 (approximately $ 1.2M) 
was for assistance for the community reuse organization. 
Rocky Flats Field Office 
The Rocky Flats facility is located about ten miles north of Golden, CO.  It is one of the facilities 
targeted by the Office of Environmental Management for closure in FY 2006.  Funding in FY 2005 was 
to assist in forming a Local Stakeholder Organization for that facility.  Funding in FY 2007 will be for 
the purposes of long-term surveillance and maintenance and post-closure contractor retiree pensions and 
benefits.

Mission
The mission of the Office of Legacy Management is to manage the Department’s post-closure 
responsibilities and ensure the future protection of human health and the environment.  This Office has 
control and custody for legacy land, structure, and facilities and is responsible for maintaining them at 
levels suitable for their long-term use.  The activities that are used to accomplish this mission include:  
(1) conduct long-term surveillance and maintenance (also referred to as long-term stewardship) at DOE 
facilities where remediation measures have been substantially completed; (2) oversee the management 
of pensions and benefits for former contractor employees; (3) perform storage, retrieval, and 
management of all records necessary for legacy management activities, (4) administer the 
Environmental Justice program, and, (5) dispose of assets no longer needed for the Department’s 
missions.   
Beginning in FY 2005, the cost of conducting External Independent Reviews (EIRs) for Capital Asset 
Projects greater than $5 million within the Legacy Management Program, have been funded by this 
program.  Examples of EIRs include conducting Performance Baseline EIRs prior to Critical Decision-2 
(CD-2) to verify the accuracy of cost and schedule baseline estimates and conducting Construction/ 
Execution Readiness EIRs, which are done for all Major System projects prior to CD-3.  These funds, 
which are managed by the Office of Engineering and Construction Management, are exclusively used 
for EIRs directly related to these projects funded within the Legacy Management program.  Beginning

Preface
The Office of Nuclear Energy, Science and Technology (NE) leads the Government’s efforts to develop 
new nuclear energy generation technologies to meet energy and climate goals, to develop advanced, 
proliferation-resistant nuclear fuel technologies that maximize energy from nuclear fuel, and to maintain 
and enhance the national nuclear technology infrastructure.  NE serves the present and future energy 
needs of the Nation by managing the safe operation and maintenance of the DOE critical nuclear 
infrastructure that provides nuclear technology goods and services. 
NE has one program completely funded within the Other Defense Activities appropriation - Idaho 
Sitewide Safeguards and Security.  In FY 2005 and FY 2006, NE has two programs that are partially 
funded within the Other Defense Activities appropriation - Idaho Facilities Management and Program 
Direction.  Beginning in FY 2007 funds for these programs are solely requested in the Energy Supply 
and Conservation appropriation.
This Overview will describe Strategic Context, Mission, Benefits, Strategic Goals and Funding by 
General Goal.  These items together put the appropriation in perspective.  The Annual Performance 
Results and Targets, Means and Strategies, and Validation and Verification sections address how the 
goals will be achieved and how performance will be measured.  
Strategic Context 
Following publication of the Administration’s “National Energy Policy”, the Department developed a 
Strategic Plan that defines its mission, four strategic goals for accomplishing that mission, and seven 
general goals to support the strategic goals.  Each appropriation has developed quantifiable goals to 
support the general goals.  Thus, the “goal cascade” is the following: 
Department Mission � Strategic Goal (25 yrs) � General Goal (10-15 yrs) � Program Goal (GPRA 
Unit) (10-15 yrs) 
To provide a concrete link between budget, performance, and reporting, the Department developed a 
“GPRAa unit” concept.  Within DOE, a GPRA unit defines a major activity or group of activities that 
support the core mission and aligns resources with specific goals.  Each GPRA unit has completed or 
will complete a Program Assessment Rating Tool (PART).  A unique program goal was developed for 
each GPRA unit.  A numbering scheme has been established for tracking performance and reporting.b
The goal cascade accomplishes two things.  First, it ties major activities for each program to successive 
goals and, ultimately, to DOE’s mission.  This helps ensure the Department focuses its resources on 
fulfilling its mission.  Second, the cascade allows DOE to track progress against quantifiable goals and 
to tie resources to each goal at any level in the cascade.  Thus, the cascade facilitates the integration of 
budget and performance information in support of the GPRA and the President’s Management Agenda 
(PMA).
a Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 
b The numbering scheme uses the following numbering convention:  First two digits identify the General Goal (01 through 
07); second two digits identify the GPRA Unit; last four digits are reserved for future use.

Mission
One of the missions of the Office of Nuclear Energy, Science and Technology is to safeguard DOE 
nuclear infrastructure that provides nuclear technology goods and services.  NE manages research 
laboratories and radiological facilities and is the Lead Program Secretarial Officer for the Idaho National 
Laboratory.
Benefits
NE plans to safeguard the national nuclear infrastructure currently in place to help meet the Nation’s 
energy, environmental, health care, and national security needs.  The Idaho Sitewide Safeguards and 
Security program provides protection of nuclear materials, classified matter, Government property, and 
other vital assets from unauthorized access, theft, diversion, sabotage, espionage, and other hostile acts 
that may cause risks to national security, the health and safety of DOE and contractor employees, the 
public or the environment.   
Strategic, General, and Program Goals 
The Department’s Strategic Plan identifies four strategic goals (one each for defense, energy, science, 
and environmental aspects of the mission) plus seven general goals that tie to the strategic goals.  The 
Office of Nuclear Energy, Science and Technology supports the following goals: 
Energy Strategic Goal:  To protect our national and economic security by promoting a diverse supply of 
reliable, affordable, and environmentally sound energy. 
General Goal 4, Energy Security:  Improve energy security by developing technologies that foster a 
diverse supply of reliable, affordable and environmentally sound energy by providing for reliable 
delivery of energy, guarding against energy emergencies, exploring advanced technologies that make a 
fundamental improvement in our mix of energy options, and improving energy efficiency. 
The programs funded by the Office of Nuclear Energy, Science and Technology within Other Defense 
Activities appropriation have the following Program Goal which contribute to General Goal 4 in the 
“goal cascade”: 
Program Goal 04.17.00.00:  Maintain, enhance, and safeguard the Nation’s nuclear infrastructure 
capability - to meet the Nation’s energy, environmental, medical research, space exploration, and 
national security needs. 
Contribution to General Goal 4 
The Department has the responsibility to maintain and enhance the Nation’s nuclear infrastructure currently in 
place.  The Idaho Sitewide Safeguards and Security program supports activities that are required to protect the 
Department’s Idaho complex assets from theft, diversion, sabotage, espionage, unauthorized access, 
compromise, and other hostile acts which may cause unacceptable adverse impacts on national security, 
program continuity, the health and safety of employees, the public, or the environment.

Major FY 2005 Achievements 
The Office of Nuclear Energy Idaho Design Basis Threat (DBT) Program Management Plan was issued 
in FY 2005.  This plan utilizes the project management aspects of DOE Order 413.1, Program and 
Project Management Policy, to achieve implementation of the 2003 DBT by the end of FY 2006.  A new 
DBT was issued in October 2004, which requires full implementation by the end of FY 2008.  All FY 
2005 actions required by the 2003 DBT project management plan that remain consistent with the 2004 
DBT were accomplished. A DBT Implementation Plan that addresses both the 2003 and the 2004 DBT 
was prepared and the final design of the video capture upgrade project, in support of the DBT, at the 
Materials and Fuels Complex has been completed.

Mission
The mission of the Infrastructure program within the Other Defense Activities appropriation is to 
safeguard the national nuclear infrastructure against hostile acts that may cause unacceptable adverse 
impacts on national security; program continuity; or the health and safety of employees, the public, or 
the environment.  The mission also includes consolidating nuclear operations required to produce 
radioisotope power systems at a single, secure site, thereby enhancing the safety and security of these 
nuclear materials. 
In FY 2005 and FY 2006, the Idaho Facilities Management program was funded in both the Energy 
Supply and Conservation and the Other Defense Activities appropriations. Beginning in FY 2007, the 
Idaho Facilities Management program is requested only under the Energy Supply and Conservation 
appropriation.  Therefore, the FY 2007 funding tables, performance measures, and budget justification 
address only the Idaho Sitewide Safeguards and Security program  
Benefits
The Infrastructure program supports the Department’s Defense Strategic Goal to protect our national 
security by protecting nuclear materials, classified matter, Government property, and other vital assets 
from unauthorized access, theft, diversion, sabotage, espionage, and other hostile acts that may cause

Means and Strategies 
NE will use various means and strategies to achieve its program goals.  However, various external 
factors may impact the ability to achieve these goals.  NE also performs collaborative activities to help 
meet its goals. 
The Department will implement the following means: 
�
Continue planning activities to implement the 2005 Design Basis Threat (DBT) Policy to ensure 
appropriate protective measures are taken commensurate with risk and consequence. 
The Department will implement the following strategies: 
��Provide physical protection and maintain operational security systems.  Implement personnel 
identity verification and diskless workstation systems and conduct semi-annual and annual program 
reviews.
The following external factors could affect NE’s ability to achieve its strategic goal: 
�
Idaho Sitewide Safeguards and Security Key External Factors:  Annual review of the Design Basis 
Threat (DBT) policy, which is based on current intelligence information and threat assessment, 
could result in significant changes in DBT requirements.  This could affect NE’s ability to achieve 
goals on schedule.  In addition, significant change in National Security Condition (SECON) level in 
response to a national security event would require re-prioritization of resources that could impact 
DBT implementation schedule.  Finally, acquisition and testing of developmental high technology 
security systems have the potential to reduce the number of protective forces personnel, however, 
these systems have not been tested in a DOE laboratory environment. 
Validation and Verification 
To validate and verify program performance, NE will conduct various internal and external reviews and 
audits.  NE’s programmatic activities are subject to continuing review by the Congress, the General 
Accountability Office, the Department’s Inspector General, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the 
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, state environmental and health agencies, the Defense Nuclear 
Facilities Safety Board, and the Department’s Office of Engineering and Construction Management 
(including DOE Real Property Management Order).  In addition, NE provides continual management 
and oversight of its vital field infrastructure programs.  Periodic internal and external program reviews 
evaluate progress against established plans.  These reviews provide an opportunity to verify and validate 
performance.  Monthly, quarterly, semi-annual and annual reviews, consistent with program 
management plans, are held to ensure technical progress, cost and schedule adherence, and 
responsiveness to program requirements. 
NERAC subcommittees evaluate progress of NE’s research and development programs.  NERAC 
similarly reviews specific program plans as they are being formulated.  In early FY 2004, NERAC 
established a Subcommittee on Evaluations. The full NERAC and its subcommittees have provided 
independent evaluations in the past, but these evaluations never comprehensively covered the entire 
nuclear energy program.  The new Subcommittee engages appropriate experts to monitor, on a continual 
basis designated NE programs and evaluate the progress of these programs against (a) direction and 
guidance provided by the full NERAC and (b) program plans and performance measures developed by

Description
The Idaho National laboratory (INL) is a multi-program national laboratory that pursues a wide range of 
nuclear power research and development and other national energy security activities.  The purpose of 
the Idaho Facilities Management (IFM) Program is to ensure that the infrastructure required to support 
these efforts is maintained and operated to meet programmatic requirements and in compliance 
environment, safety and health rules and regulations. 
The IFM Program manages and operates the three main engineering and research campuses at the INL: 
(1) the Reactor Technology Center (RTC) at the site, a 890 square mile reservation west of Idaho Falls, 
(2) the Materials and Fuels Complex (MFC) at the site, and (3) the Science and Technology Complex 
(STC) in Idaho Falls. As INL landlord, the IFM Program also manages and operates the Central 
Facilities Area (CFA) at the site and various sitewide infrastructure systems and facilities, such as 
electrical utility distribution. 
The STC, CFA and sitewide infrastructure systems and facilities come under Sitewide Infrastructure 
within the IFM Program.  The funding above is for Sitewide Infrastructure only.  In FY 2005 and FY 
2006, the Sitewide Infrastructure part of the IFM program was funded in the Other Defense Activities 
appropriations.  Beginning in FY 2007, all of the Idaho Facilities Management Program is requested 
under the Energy Supply and Conservation appropriation.
Benefits
The IFM program supports “National Energy Policy” goals by maintaining and operating INL basic 
infrastructure that is required to support facilities dedicated to advanced nuclear energy technology 
research and many other Federal government activities.  Additional activities include managing special 
nuclear materials contained in these facilities and the disposition of DOE legacy waste materials under 
NE ownership.

Description 
The mission of the Idaho Sitewide Safeguards and Security (S&S) program is to protect DOE interests 
from theft, diversion, sabotage, espionage, unauthorized access, compromise, and other hostile acts that 
may cause unacceptable adverse impacts on national security; program continuity; or the health and 
safety of employees, the public, or the environment. 
a Program levels reflect Work for Others (WFO) before the bottom line reduction to the NE appropriation for a “Security 
Charge for Reimbursable Work.” This offset is displayed above by fiscal year.  The new budget authority, as well as the 
offsetting collections (such as when other agencies are using the facility), for the WFO portion of the S&S budget is included 
in Departmental Administration’s Cost of Work for Others program, which is managed by the Department’s Office of Chief 
Financial Officer.

Benefits
This program is designed to support DOE’s Defense Strategic Goal to protect our national security.  The 
Idaho Sitewide Safeguards and Security program provides protection of nuclear materials, classified 
matter, Government property, and other vital assets from unauthorized access, theft, diversion, sabotage, 
espionage, and other hostile acts that may cause risks to national security, the health and safety of DOE 
and contractor employees, the public or the environment.   
DOE will fully implement the 2003 Design Basis Threat (DBT) in FY 2006 by completing physical 
upgrades and reducing Category I facilities at INL to two co-located Category I facilities protected by a 
single Perimeter Intrusion Detection and Assessment System (PIDAS).  Implementation is in accordance 
with the approved resource-loaded Idaho Site DBT Implementation Plan. 
DOE will continue planning activities toward implementation of the 2005 DBT policy requirements 
using a risk-informed approach to physical upgrades.  Both the 2004 and 2005 DBT policy requirements 
increased the strength of the postulated adversarial threat over the 2003 DBT; although detailed 
vulnerability assessments have not yet been completed, significant security system physical upgrades are 
expected.  DOE’s Office of Independent Oversight and Performance Assurance conducted a site 
assistance visit at Idaho to identify opportunities to increase security in a more cost effective manner 
through better integration of highly advanced security technology with site security operations.  Pending 
the completion of vulnerability assessments, which will guide protection strategy, DOE believes that 
early investment in improved positions for defending forces, more capable detection systems, and 
technological deterrent devices at target locations will result in cost avoidance over the lifetime by 
relying more on technology and tactics than additional protective force members to counter the revised 
threat.
DOE will also implement Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 201, entitled Personal
Identity Verification of Federal Employees and Contractors. FIPS 201 was developed to satisfy the 
requirements of Homeland Security Presidential Directive/HSPD-12. The new standard requires 
improving identity and authentication of Federal employees and contractors accessing Federal facilities 
and information systems. 
DOE would like to begin the transition to a diskless classified computing environment in FY 2007.  This 
initiative would be funded by user programs.

Mission
Program Direction provides the Federal staffing resources and associated costs required to provide 
overall direction and execution of the Office of Nuclear Energy, Science and Technology (NE).  NE 
promotes secure, competitive, and environmentally responsible nuclear technologies to serve the present 
and future energy needs of the country.  NE carries out this mission in several ways.  As the central 
organization with the Federal Government’s core expertise in nuclear technology, NE directs the 
Nation’s investment in nuclear science and technology by sponsoring research at the national 
laboratories, U.S. universities, and private industry.  Through its support of innovative, higher risk 
science and by helping to preserve the national research and development infrastructure, NE works to 
advance the responsible use of nuclear technology.  NE also manages the safe operation and 
maintenance of critical nuclear infrastructure and provides nuclear technology goods and services to 
industry and government. 
NE is the Lead Program Secretarial Officer (LPSO) of the Idaho site.  NE Headquarters and the Idaho 
Operations Office reorganized in January 2005 to more effectively support the new nuclear energy 
missions and prepare for the oversight and management of the new contracts for the operation of the 
Idaho site.  This new structure will carry out all programmatic, project, and landlord responsibilities 
assigned to NE now and in the future, both as LPSO and Contracting Officer for DOE’s operations in 
Idaho, and as responsible PSO for programs, projects, facilities, and operations at other DOE sites.  In 
a  Beginning in FY 2007, funding for Idaho Operations Office is requested under Energy Supply and Conservation. 
b This number represents actual FY 2005 FTE usage.

FY 2005 and FY 2006, the program direction account for the Idaho Operations Office was funded from 
the Other Defense Activities appropriation.  Beginning in FY 2007, funding for Idaho Operations Office 
is requested under Energy Supply and Conservation appropriation.
As stated in the Departmental Strategic Plan, DOE’s Strategic and General Goals will be accomplished 
not only through the efforts of the major program offices in the Department but with additional effort 
from offices which support the programs in carrying out the mission.  The Office of Nuclear Energy, 
Science and Technology performs critical functions which directly support the mission of the 
Department.  These functions include: maintain, enhance, and safeguard the Nation’s nuclear 
infrastructure capability - to meet the Nation’s energy, environmental, medical research, space 
exploration, and national security needs.

Description 
From FY 1999 through 2006, funding has been provided within the Other Defense Activities 
appropriation to offset funding within the Departmental Administration appropriation.  This offset 
addresses the significant amount of administrative support activities performed within the Departmental 
Administration appropriation that are of direct benefit to the Department’s defense related programs. 
Per direction provided in the FY 2004 Energy Water and Development conference report, the FY 2007 
budget request reflects a proportional contribution from Other Defense Activities for Departmental 
Administration costs.  This budget offsets Departmental Administration administrative work that 
supports the following appropriations: Defense Environmental Cleanup, Defense Nuclear Waste 
Disposal, and Other Defense Activities.  These functions do not duplicate services provided within the 
Office of the Administrator for the National Nuclear Security Administrative Program. 
Benefits
The services provided by the offices within Departmental Administration are performed without 
distinction between defense and non-defense related activities and benefit all headquarters organizations 
proportionally.  These activities include processing personnel actions, building maintenance and 
operation, payroll and general accounting services, budgeting and funds execution, procurement, project 
management, information management, legal services, life-cycle asset management, workforce 
diversity, minority economic impact, policy, international affairs, Congressional and intergovernmental 
liaison, public affairs, and management of the Working Capital Fund.

Preface
The Department of Energy operates and supervises a great number of programs to further its National 
Defense and the Environmental Strategic Goals.  Many of these programs seek to balance the interests 
of different and sometimes competing stakeholders. The Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) 
provides legal adjudicatory services for the Department’s programs so that these conflicting interests 
may be decided in a fair, impartial and efficient manner.  
Within the Other Defense Activities Appropriation, OHA operates with three principal legal staffs – the 
Office of Legal Analysis, the Office of Financial Analysis and the Office of Economic Analysis. 
This Overview will describe Strategic Context, Mission, and Benefits. These items together put this 
Appropriation in perspective. 
Strategic Context
Following publication of the Administration’s National Energy Policy, the Department developed a 
Strategic Plan that defines the mission, four strategic goals for accomplishing that mission, and seven 
general goals to support the strategic goals. As stated in the Departmental Strategic Plan, DOE’s 
Strategic and General Goals will be accomplished not only through the efforts of the major program 
offices in the Department but with additional effort from offices which support the programs in carrying 
out the mission. OHA performs critical functions which directly support the mission of the Department. 
These functions include ensuring, through its role in conducting hearings in Personnel Security cases, 
that only trustworthy employees are allowed access to classified information or controlled nuclear 
materials.  Likewise, in its supervision of Whistleblower hearings, OHA insures that the Department has 
a workplace where employee concerns about health and safety, fraud, waste, abuse or mismanagement 
may be freely expressed to DOE or contractor management without fear of retaliation.   OHA’s role in 
deciding Appeals and Applications for Exceptions supports the Department in ensuring that relevant 
regulations and statutes are applied properly and without undue disruption to the private sector. This 
directly benefits the public and reduces the Department’s litigation costs in Federal courts.

Mission
OHA’s mission is to conduct fair and efficient hearings and to issue decisions of the Department with 
respect to any adjudicative proceedings that the Secretary may delegate.  OHA’s jurisdiction includes, 
for example, security clearance hearings, hearings of complaints filed under the DOE Contractor 
Employee Protection Program as well as appeals requesting review of any determination reached by any 
official within the Department under OHA’s jurisdiction. 
As stated in the Departmental Strategic Plan, DOE’s Strategic and General Goals will be accomplished 
not only through the efforts of the major program offices in the Department but with additional effort 
from offices which support the programs in carrying out the mission of the Department. OHA performs 
critical functions which directly support the mission. These functions include ensuring, through its role 
in conducting hearings in Personnel Security cases, that only trustworthy employees are allowed access 
to classified information or controlled nuclear materials.  Likewise, in its supervision of Whistleblower 
hearings, OHA insures that the Department has a workplace where employee concerns about health and 
safety, fraud, waste, abuse or mismanagement may be freely expressed to DOE or contractor 
management without fear of retaliation. OHA’s role in deciding Appeals and Applications for 
Exceptions supports the Department in ensuring that relevant regulations and statutes are applied 
properly and without undue disruption to the private sector. This directly benefits the public and reduces 
the Department’s litigation costs in Federal courts. 
Benefits
In its adjudicatory mission for the Department, OHA offers a fair, impartial and customer-friendly 
process in which firms and individuals may seek review of agency actions. OHA is also charged with 
conducting hearings in Personnel Security cases.  OHA issues timely, high quality decisions in cases 
involving DOE personnel security clearance adjudications that ensure only trustworthy personnel are 
allowed access to classified information and special nuclear materials. Thus, OHA directly supports the 
Department’s Defense Strategic Goal of helping ensure the security of the nuclear weapons stockpile.
OHA also conducts investigations and hearings concerning whistleblower complaints filed by DOE 
contractor employees and for issuing final agency decisions resolving them.  In these cases, OHA strives 
to balance the public interest in promoting a workplace where concerns may be freely expressed without 
retaliation against the need of DOE contractors to manage their resources efficiently. This is especially 
important with regard to the Department’s Environmental Strategic Goal to ensure that cleanup of the 
environmental legacy of the Cold War is effectively performed. 
OHA also analyzes and decides appeals requesting review of any determination reached by any other 
official within the Department under the jurisdiction of the Secretary, including initial determinations 
under the Freedom of Information Act, the Privacy Act, the payments-equal-to-taxes (PETT) provisions 
of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, the special assessment provisions for the Uranium Enrichment 
Decontamination and Decommissioning Fund under the Energy Policy Act of 1992, and the 
reimbursement of costs of remedial actions at active uranium or thorium processing sites under the 
Energy Policy Act of 1992.  OHA is responsible for deciding Applications for Exception from the 
generally applicable requirements of a rule, regulation or order of the Department.  The Office also 
analyzes Petitions for Special Redress seeking "extraordinary relief" apart from or in addition to any 
other remedy provided in the Department's enabling statutes. By ensuring that the Department properly 
applies relevant regulations and statutes to affected parties, OHA directly benefits the public and saves 
the Department litigation expenses in federal courts.

Safeguards and Security 
Program Mission
The mission of the Safeguards and Security (S&S) program at each Department of Energy (DOE) site is 
to protect DOE interests from theft, diversion, sabotage, espionage, unauthorized access, compromise, 
and other hostile acts which may cause unacceptable adverse impacts on national security, program 
continuity, the health and safety of employees, the public or the environment. 
This section of the budget provides summary budget estimates of the Department’s S&S programs.  
Details of the individual S&S programs and their budgets are found in the following program budget

Program Overview 
The budget for the Department’s direct funded S&S programs is organized to ensure consistency in 
program and budget execution and ensure adequate management, direction, tracking and monitoring of 
security costs throughout the Department.  Each S&S program budget provides high visibility for S&S 
issues and helps the Department prioritize functions for effective and efficient S&S program 
implementation.  Furthermore, the structure of the S&S budgets ensures consistency in budget execution 
across diverse programs, principally the National Nuclear Security Administration, Environmental 
Management, Science, and Nuclear Energy.  For these Field Security programs, the budget structure 
takes the form of the following seven program elements: 
1.  Protective Forces: Provides for the protection of special nuclear materials, information, employees, 
and government property from theft, diversion, sabotage, and malicious destruction. 
2.  Security Systems:  Addresses access control and interior/exterior intrusion detection systems. 
3.  Information Security:  Ensures that individuals protect classified matter and sensitive unclassified 
matter, and establishes protection systems that require degrees of protection for each classification level. 
4.  Cyber Security:  Assures effective and efficient protection of computer and technical resources. 
5.  Personnel Security: Supports activities associated with the access authorization program.

Protective Forces 
Mission
The mission of Protective Forces is to protect the Department’s critical assets which include nuclear 
weapons in DOE custody, nuclear weapons components, special nuclear materials, classified 
information and DOE facilities against a spectrum of threats, including terrorist activity, sabotage, 
espionage, theft, diversion, loss or unauthorized use.  To accomplish this mission: 
�
Protective Force programs throughout the complex provide for salaries, wages and benefits for 
personnel; proper management and supervision; and sufficient quantities of well maintained and 
logically deployed equipment and facilities to ensure effective performance of assigned functions 
and tasks under normal and emergency conditions. 
�
Protective Forces programs perform critical functions including the conduct of access control and 
security response operations; the physical protection of special nuclear material, classified matter 
and information, and government property; emergency response forces and tactical assistance during 
events as well as an on-scene security commander; random patrols; coordination with local law 
enforcement and protective force elements aimed at providing effective response to emergency 
situations; random prohibited article inspections; security alarm monitoring and dispatch services; 
the collection and destruction of classified matter; and constant testing of the protective force to 
respond to various event scenarios.
�
Protective Forces Programs maintain a Special Response Team capability to provide resolution of 
incidents that require effective and timely response with force options that exceed the capability of 
front line protective force personnel.  This includes recapture and recovery operations involving the 
use of special weapons, systems and tactics to effect recovery of special nuclear material under 
authorized control.

Security Systems 
Mission
The mission of Security Systems is the physical protection of special nuclear material and vital 
equipment, sensitive information, Departmental property and unclassified facilities.  Included are 
buildings, fences, barriers, lighting, sensors, surveillance devices, entry control devices, access control 
systems, explosive detection systems, power systems and other real property and hardware designed for, 
or affecting security.  This hardware and equipment is operated and used to support the protection of 
DOE property and other interests of national security. 
Security Systems programs support DOE-wide efforts required to conduct performance assurance 
testing.  These programs also ensure that security alarm systems are operational and functioning in 
accordance with applicable DOE Orders.  Security System programs are also responsible for two 
essential subprograms:  (1) a barriers/secure storage/lock program to restrict, limit, delay or deny entry 
into a designated area; and (2), an entry control/access program that provides positive identification of 
personnel requiring access to facilities and initial access to facilities in general, ensuring that persons 
entering/leaving facilities are authorized, and do not introduce prohibited articles into or remove 
Government property from Departmental facilities. 
Estimates are provided for all access control administrative activity involving production, accountability 
and destruction of access authorization badges and firearms credentials.  Estimates are also provided for 
vital systems components and tamper-safe oversight is provided by monitoring and responding to 
alarms, determining access and securing all alarmed structures on site.  In addition, this element 
provides for handling all radio communications for the protection of the facilities.

Material Control and Accountability 
Mission
The mission of Material Control and Accountability (MC&A) is to provide assurance that nuclear 
materials are properly controlled and accounted for at all times.  MC&A provides evidence that all 
nuclear materials are accounted for appropriately and that theft, diversion, or operational loss has not 
occurred.  MC&A also supports weapons production, nuclear nonproliferation, nuclear materials 
operations, facility closure, and nuclear critical safety by determining and documenting the amounts of 
nuclear materials in weapons and packaged items.  MC&A administration includes the following: (1) 
assessing the levels of protection, control and accounting required for the types and quantities of 
materials at each facility; (2) documenting facility plans for nuclear materials control and accounting; 
(3) assigning authorities and responsibilities for MC&A functions; (4) ensuring that facility MC&A 
personnel are trained and qualified to perform their responsibilities; (5) establishing programs to report 
occurrences such as nuclear material theft, the loss of control or inability to account for nuclear 
materials, or evidence of malevolent acts; (6) conducting performance testing of required program 
elements; and (7) establishing facility programs to conduct and document internal assessments of their 
operations and MC&A programs.
