SUMMARY: Pursuant to the Computer 
Matching and Privacy Protection Act of 
1988, as amended, and the Office of 
Management and Budget’s (OMB) 
Guidance on the statute, HUD is 
updating its notice of a matching 
program involving comparisons 
between income data provided by 
applicants or participants in HUD’s 
assisted housing programs and 
independent sources of income 
information. The matching program will 
be carried out to detect inappropriate 
(excessive or insufficient) housing 
assistance under the National Housing 
Act, the United States Housing Act of 
1937, section 101 of the Housing and 
Community Development Act of 1965, 
the Native American Housing 
Assistance and Self-Determination Act 
of 1996, and the Quality Housing and 
Work Responsibility Act of 1998. The 
program provides for the verification of 
the matching results and the initiation 
of appropriate administrative or legal 
actions, primarily through public 
housing agencies (HAs) and owners and 
agents (all collectively referred to as 
POAs). Indian tribes and tribally 
designated housing entities (TDHEs) are 
not a mandatory component of the 
computer matching program. 
Participation by Indian tribes and 
TDHEs is discretionary; however, they 
may receive and use social security and 
supplemental security income matching 
information provided by HUD. 
This notice provides an overview of 
computer matching for HUD’s assisted 
housing programs. Specifically, the 
notice describes HUD’s program for 
computer matching of its tenant data to: 
(a) The SSA’s earned income and the 
IRS’s unearned income data, (b) SSA’s 
wage, social security, supplemental 
security income and special veterans 
benefits data, (c) State Wage Information 
Collection Agencies’ (SWICAs’) wage 
I. Authority 
This matching program is being 
conducted pursuant to sections 3003 
and 13403 of the Omnibus Budget 
Reconciliation Act of 1993 (Pub. L. 103–
66, approved August 10, 1993); section 
542(b) of the 1998 Appropriations Act 
(Pub. L. 105–65); section 904 of the 
Stewart B. McKinney Homeless 
Assistance Amendments Act of 1988 (42 
U.S.C. 3544); section 165 of the Housing 
and Community Development Act of 
1987 (42 U.S.C. 3543); the National 
Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1701–1750g); 
the United States Housing Act of 1937 
(42 U.S.C. 1437–1437z); section 101 of 
the Housing and Community 
Development Act of 1965 (12 U.S.C. 
1701s); the Native American Housing 
Assistance and Self-Determination Act 
of 1996 (25 U.S.C. 4101 et seq.); and the 
Quality Housing and Work 
Responsibility Act of 1998 (42 U.S.C. 
1437a(f)). 
The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation 
Act of 1993 (Budget Reconciliation Act) 
authorizes HUD to request from the SSA 
and the IRS Federal tax information as 
prescribed in section 6103(l)(7) of title 
26 of the United States Code (Internal 
Revenue Code). Section 542(b) of HUD’s 
1998 Appropriation Act (Pub. L. 105–
65; October 27, 1997) eliminated a 
September 30, 1998, sunset provision to 
26 U.S.C. 6103(l)(7)(D)(ix) of the 
Internal Revenue Code, effectively 
making permanent the authority for SSA 
and IRS disclosures of federal tax 
information to HUD. 
The Federal tax information that HUD 
receives includes income data that 
individuals receive from employers and 
financial institutions (e.g., income data 
that would be shown on IRS Form W–
2 and Form 1099) for use in preparing 
tax returns. The Budget Reconciliation 
Act prohibits HUD redisclosure of tax 
data to POAs. However, it allows HUD 
to disclose the fact that discrepancies 
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This 
notice supersedes a similar notice 
published in the Federal Register on 
May 5, 2003 (68 FR 23753). Since that 
time, the matching program has been 
implemented on a large scale. In 
previous years, the computer matching 
was carried out for random samples of 
households receiving rental assistance 
or for selected POAs. During calendar 
year 1999, HUD used the matching 
program for a large-scale computer 
matching project involving over 2 
million households. HUD announced 
plans for the large-scale implementation 
of the program in 64 FR 49817 
(September 14, 1999).

Protection Act (CMPPA) of 1988, an
