DETERMINATION OF STRENGTH OF HOSES AND COUPLINGS, 
TYPE C, AND CE SUPPLIED-AIR RESPIRATORS 
STANDARD TESTING PROCEDURE (STP) 
 
1. 
PURPOSE 
 
This test establishes the procedures for ensuring that the level of protection provided by the 
strength of hoses and couplings requirements on Types C and CE Supplied-Air Respirators 
submitted for Approval, Extension of Approval, or examined during Certified Product Audits, 
meet the minimum certification standards set forth in 42 CFR, Part 84, Subpart G, Section 
84.63(a)(c)(d), and Subpart J, Section 84.150, Table 8; Volume 60, Number 110, June 8, 1995. 
 
2. 
GENERAL 
 
This STP describes the Determination of Strength of Hose and Coupling Type C, and CE 
Supplied-Air Respirators test in sufficient detail that a person knowledgeable in the appropriate 
technical field can select equipment with the necessary resolution, conduct the test, and determine 
whether or not the product passes the test.

TESTING REQUIREMENTS AND CONDITIONS 
 
 
4.1. 
Prior to beginning any testing, all measuring equipment to be used must have been 
calibrated in accordance with the manufacturer's calibration procedure and schedule.  At 
a minimum, all measuring equipment utilized for this testing must have been calibrated 
within the preceding 12 months using a method traceable to the National Institute of 
Standards and Technology (NIST). 
 
4.2. 
The compressed gas cylinder must meet all applicable Department of Transportation 
requirements for cylinder approval as well as for retesting/requalification. 
 
4.3. 
Normal laboratory safety practices must be observed.  This includes safety precautions 
described in the current ALOSH Facility Laboratory Safety Manual. 
 
 
 
4.3.1. Safety glasses, lab coats, and hard-toe shoes must be worn at all times. 
 
4.3.2. Work benches must be maintained free of clutter and non-essential test 
equipment. 
 
4.3.3. When handling any glass laboratory equipment, lab technicians and personnel 
must wear special gloves which protect against lacerations or punctures. 
 
5. 
PROCEDURE 
 
Note: 
Reference Section 3 for equipment, model numbers and manufacturers.  For calibration 
purposes use those described in the manufacturer's operation and maintenance manuals. 
 
 
5.1. 
Use the test operating procedure as follows: 
5.1.1. Connect two sections of the applicant's supplied-air hose with coupling (be sure 
to use the safety cable). 
 
5.1.2. Secure one end of connected hoses to the proper test weight (45 kilograms-100 
pounds), or to the Tinius Olsen strain gauge (within 1-foot of the coupling). 
 
5.1.3. Place air-supply hose over a four-inch pulley held suspended with a short rope

from an overhead chain hoist, or connect the hose coupling on the other end of 
the hose to the opposite end of the strain gauge (within 1-foot of the coupling). 
 
5.1.4. Attach one end of connected hoses to a two-stage regulator and compressed air 
source; attach a female quick connect coupling to the opposite end of the 
connected hoses. 
 
5.1.5. Slowly increase air pressure within connected hoses until desired pressure is 
reached and check for signs of possible rupture. 
 
5.1.6. Pull air-supply hose across the pulley until hose becomes taut, making certain 
that the coupling of the hoses is between the hoist and the weight, or both 
couplings and the strain gauge is between the hoist and the anchor point (See 
Figure 1). 
 
5.1.7. Secure remaining end of the connected hoses. 
 
5.1.8. Slowly raise the hook of the overhead hoist and start the timer when weight 
leaves the laboratory floor, or when the required weight has been reached on the 
strain gauge. 
 
5.1.9. After five minutes, stop the timer and release the pull on the hose couplings. 
 
5.1.10. Remove pressure from within connected air-supply hoses. 
 
5.1.11. Examine the couplings and hoses for any indications of separation or failure. 
 
 
Note: 
Photographs may be taken for records documentation. 
 
 
Note: 
If the hoses pass this test then the same hoses and couplings must be used on the 
Tightness of Hose and Couplings and Gasoline Permeation tests. 
 
6. 
PASS/FAIL CRITERIA 
 
6.1. 
The criterion for passing this test is set forth in 42 CFR, Part 84, Subpart G, Section

 Air-supply-lines used with Types C and CE, hose and couplings shall not exhibit any 
separation or failure when tested with a pull of 45 kg. (100 pounds) for 5 minutes and 
when simultaneously subjecting them to an internal air pressure of 2 times the maximum 
respirator-supply pressure that is specified by the applicant or at 173 kN/m.2 (25 pounds 
per square inch) gauge, whichever is higher. 
 
7. 
RECORDS\TEST SHEETS 
 
7.1. 
All test data will be recorded on the STRENGTH OF HOSES AND COUPLINGS, TYPE 
C AND CE, SUPPLIED-AIR RESPIRATORS test data sheet. 
 
7.2. 
All videotapes and photographs of the actual test being performed, or of the tested 
equipment shall be maintained in the task file as part of the permanent record. 
 
7.3. 
All equipment failing any portion of this test will be handled as follows: 
 
7.3.1. If the failure occurs on a new certification application, or extension of approval 
application, send a test report to the RCT Leader and prepare the hardware for 
return to the manufacturer. 
 
7.3.2. If the failure occurs on hardware examined under an Off-the-Shelf Audit the 
hardware will be examined by a technician and the RCT Leader for cause.  All 
equipment failing any portion of this test may be sent to the manufacturer for 
examination and then returned to NIOSH.  However, the hardware tested shall be 
held at the testing laboratory until authorized for release by the RCT Leader, or 
his designee, following the standard operating procedures outlined in Procedure 
for Scheduling, and Processing Post-Certification Product Audits, RB-SOP-
0005-00.
