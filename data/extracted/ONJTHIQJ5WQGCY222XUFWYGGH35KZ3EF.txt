Larson Statement on Ryan Budget | Congressman John Larson
Tuesday, 12 March 2013
  
(Washington) – Today Congressman John B. Larson released the following statement on the
proposed budget by House Republicans:
  
"Paul Ryan, in a clear effort to appease the radical tea party members of the Republican
caucus, has put forth a budget even more austere than his last proposal to end Medicare as we
know it. Today Ryan refused to deal with the problems our nation is currently facing, and
proposed a budget that would end the Medicare guarantee, end protections for those with
pre-existing conditions, and prevent children from staying on their parents policies until age 26.
  
"This budget does not address the most critical thing we can do to address our deficit – create
jobs. This budget also fails to recognize the fact that we do not have a Medicare beneficiary
problem, we have a problem related to the overall costs of healthcare. These costs need to be
addressed based on the extraordinary amount of waste, fraud, and abuse that exists in the
system, not on the backs of beneficiaries.
  
"This proposal is disingenuous and again shows a Republican leadership willing to throw raw
meat to their radical conservatives, who would rather see millions without healthcare than admit
that the American people are better served by making sure everyone has an opportunity to be
insured."
