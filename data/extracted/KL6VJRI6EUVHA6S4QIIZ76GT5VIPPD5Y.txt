A DRIVE THROUGH the Uintah Ba-
sin, under the watch of King’s Peak, 
across the maize-colored, antelope 
speckled plains, through the alfalfa 
ﬁ elds and the red cliffs to the ﬁ sh-
ﬁ lled waters of Flaming Gorge, to 
the lights of the oil rigs twinkling on 
the horizon, reveals that the lifestyle 
and economy of the Uintah Basin is 
grounded in natural resources. It’s a 
region of roots, veins and bones, of 
range cattle, oil wells and dinosaurs. 
Duchesne, Daggett and Uintah 
counties each bring unique boun-
ties and challenges and most impor-
tantly, opportunities for business.
Center. Slated to open in 2009, the 
building will be a state-of-the-art, 
high-tech educational facility to train 
students in engineering, water man-
agement, natural resources and en-
vironmental policy, to name a few.
 
In July, the Anadarko Foundation, 
a nonproﬁ t organization of Anadarko 
Petroleum Corporation, announced 
a $1.5 million joint gift to the univer-
sity and the Uintah Basin Applied 
Technology College. The gift will 
fund construction of the Anadarko 
Petroleum 
Corporation 
Industrial 
Technology Building, which will offer 
programs critical to the natural gas 
and oil industry, but it will also edu-
cate locals so that they are able to 
live and work where they grew up. 
“We will have state-of-the-art facili-
ties, equipment and programs in in-
dustrial engineering, chemistry and 
geology,” Raymond says. “We can 
get our young people to ﬁ ll the jobs 
we need.”
  
Which leads to another so-called 
problem: more jobs than workers 
and a lack of housing for the work-
ers already in place. “We have too 
many high paying jobs that we can’t 
ﬁ ll,” says Michael McKee, chairman 
of the Uintah County Commission. 
“Now that is an exciting problem!” 
According to the Utah Department of 
developer or county ofﬁ cial. “I have 
a three-minute commute to work, 
the people are friendly, I don’t lock 
my doors at night, and you’re 30 
to 40 minutes away from anything 
you want to do, horseback riding, 
whitewater rafting, the Green River, 
ﬁ shing…I enjoy the recreation.” 
 
Mark Raymond, County Commis-
sioner says the area is growing fast. 
 
“Things are happening here,” 
he says. “The traditional boom-and-
bust cycle of the Uintah Basin is past 
history.” He is talking about oil, of 
course, the grease of the county’s 
economic cogs for decades. But that 
grease, combined with a tradition of 
tourism and agriculture, has opened 
opportunities in other industries.
 
Especially exciting are develop-
ments in higher education, on the 
Utah State University Uintah Basin 
Regional Campus. Recently, Utah 
entrepreneur Marc Bingham and his 
wife, Debbie, donated $15 million 
to the campus to build the Entre-
preneurship and Energy Research

Gary McClellan is a saddle maker from 
Maeser, a small town just outside 
Vernal. For 18 years he has worked for 
Dry Fork Saddle, a company his brother, 
Brad, started in 1972. The company 
builds about 900 saddles a year and 
sell them worldwide for some $2,735 
each. “We can’t keep up,” he says, but 
enjoys the work as much as the suc-
cess. “I like seeing the ﬁ nished prod-
uct. It is satisfying to watch progress 
every day, to see the end result.”

“The goal of the BLM’s oil

billion barrels of recoverable oil. The 
PEIS identiﬁ es the most promising 
shale areas in Utah, Colorado and 
Wyoming that will be open to appli-
cations for commercial leasing. BLM 
Director Jim Caswell said in a press 
release, “The goal of the BLM’s oil

nomically viable and environmen-
tally sound production of oil shale on 
Western lands, where we estimate 
deposits hold…enough to meet U.S. 
demand for imported oil at current 
levels for 110 years.” 
 
For McKee, this is an unfathom-
able opportunity for the people of Uin-
tah County and beyond. “We could 
solve the nation’s energy needs. Utah 
is going to play a major role.”

Workforce Services, unemployment 
is 2.6 percent. “We are very upbeat. 
We have a great county,” says Mc-
Kee. “But we have shortages.”
 
Some solutions are in motion. In 
July, the county approved an 80-acre 
development complex in Vernal for re-
tail, entertainment and hotels, accord-
ing to the Uintah Basin Standard. At 
least three hotels are planned, includ-
ing Hawthorne Suites, La Quinta and 
Hyatt’s Summerﬁ eld Suites and, ac-
cording to a developer quoted in the 
Standard, “Industry representatives 
from Halliburton and Anadarko have 
agreed to guarantee 60 percent occu-
pancy of any hotel built on the site for 
the next three years.”
 
While Uintah County is support-
ing an ever-diversifying economy, 
McKee says the oil and gas sec-
tors remain the strongest and most 
likely to grow. “They are driving our 
economy. Of the natural gas pro-
duced in Utah, 57 percent comes 
out of Uintah County,” at a value of 
$1,160,209,692. McKee underscores 
the importance of the basin’s natu-
ral resources. “Only 15 percent of 
the county is privately held, which 
means we have low property taxes. 
Seventeen percent is tribal. Our pub-
lic lands are extremely important for 
recreation, agriculture and oil.”
 
Big news came to the Basin 
in 2008, when the Bureau of Land 
Management released its Final Pro-
grammatic Environmental Impact 
Statement (PEIS) for the Green River 
Formation, the largest oil shale de-
posit in the world estimated at 800 
en, Director of Duchesne County Eco-
nomic Development. Services related 
to mining, such as welding, trucking 
and commercial construction, are 
feeding off of oil and gas, yet there is 
growth in other areas as well, such as 
tourism. Hotels are booked all sum-
mer as are the area’s seven resorts, 
ranches and ﬁ shing destinations. In 
Myton, chic restaurant Hollow Moon 
is serving up fresh baby greens and 
gelato to locals and travelers alike.
 
While “oil and gas may be our 
bread and butter, agriculture is our 
backbone,” Hansen says. Duchesne 
County ranks in the top ﬁ ve producers 
of cattle, hay and corn. 
  
Hansen, part economic developer, 
part cheerleader, part fundraiser, is 
especially excited to see county 
residents getting their piece of the 
pie. “When outside companies come 
into the county, that’s wonderful,” she 
says. “But when a local sees an 
opportunity and seizes it and ex-
pands, that is even better!”  
 
County residents are better able to 
capitalize when they have local leaders 
rooting for them. For example, Duch-
esne is the second largest user of the 
Enterprise Zone Tax Credit Program, 
created in 1988 for job creation and 
new investment in counties with less 
than 50,000 residents. Businesses 
that qualify receive helpful tax credits 
and in Duchesne, “it has helped a lot,” 
says Hansen. “It has been extremely 
well utilized.”
 
A new program from the Gover-
nor’s Ofﬁ ce of Economic Develop-
ment has given one company in Bal-
lard a huge boost. McMullin Heating 
& Cooling was recently awarded 
$50,000 from the Rural Fast Track 
(RFT) program, which provides incen-
tives to help companies in small 
towns grow and offer additional high-
er paying jobs. Amber McMullin, sec-
retary for the company, says they will 
use the money for a new building for 
inventory and ofﬁ ce space, and hire 
more employees. In the past, “we 
have had to turn business away,” she 
says, but not anymore. McMullin is a 
company that has grown with the oil 
and covered with a patchwork of 
farmland, Duchesne County is quiet 
and rural, but underneath the verdant 
hills hums an economic engine. The 
combination of bountiful natural 
resources and an energetic leadership 
that uses every tool in the box have 
kept the county on a growth pattern 
for years and most sectors show no 
sign of a slow down. All signs point to 
encourage growth and development. 
 
The strongest sector continues to 
be the oil and gas industry. Duch-
esne is Utah’s largest producer of 
crude oil at 39 percent of the State’s 
output. “The durable nature of the 
industry encourages supportive new 
businesses which are starting up at 
breakneck speed,” says Irene Hans-

If the community is lacking in any-
thing, says Hansen, it is more hotels 
and retail and, as in Uintah County, 
housing. “There is opportunity here. 
We are losing 75 percent of our retail 
money to other towns. Wal-Mart serves 
a region, but if they are not in your com-
munity, you lose.” Hansen adds that 
the downtown is full, creating a need 
for infrastructure. “When you have fast 
growth, you have to adapt. But we are 
meeting the challenge.”
industry, providing AC at camp loca-
tions, over mine computers and in 
metal industrial buildings. But the 
company would not have qualiﬁ ed for 
the RFT award if it wasn’t for help from 
local ofﬁ cials. 
 
“We really appreciate Irene,” 
says McMullin. “She is on the ball. 
She made me realize that the RFT is 
for rural businesses and will help the 
community.”
DESTINATION: DAGGETT
Tucked in Utah’s eastern-most cor-
ner with endless opportunities for 
recreation, less than 1,000 residents 
and yet not one stoplight, Daggett 
County is the place to get away. “In 
the wintertime we are in our own 
little world,” says Brian Raymond, 
County Commission Assistant and 
Director of Economic Development. 
Of the 1,186 residences in the area, 
Raymond estimates that 70 percent 
are second homes, enjoyed for one 
week, two weeks, or months at a 
time by Daggett part-timers.
 
“Recreation is why a lot of people 
are here,” he says, “including full-time 
locals.” Because the majority of Dag-
gett’s land is owned by the govern-
ment, most residents work for the 
government in some capacity−in the 
ﬁ eld, the school district or local gov-
ernment positions−or work in tourism 
and travel. This predicament, or 
opportunity, means that leaders must 
get creative and use the county’s 
natural beauty every way they can.
 
While Daggett showed huge job 
growth in early 2008, it was due to 
pipeline construction and some 
expansion in the travel and tourism 
industry. The latter is the key to the 
region’s sustainable economy.
 
According to the Economic De-
velopment Corporation of Utah, Dag-
gett County is working to update the 
County General Plan including the 
Dutch John area. The Report says 
that the County “is working with Aspen 
Rivers, LLC, a team of specialized 
planners, to evaluate existing plans 
and improve the implementation 
ability and create a clearer path to 
develop a sustainable economy.” 
Dutch John is just one region of many 
that offers potential growth for tourism.
 
Over the years, economic devel-
opers have created festivals, events 
and races—anything to attract new 
visitors to its outdoor playground. 
In August the county held the fourth 
Tower Rock 10K Run, an event cre-
ated to generate revenue which has 
been a big success; this year there 
were 71 runners and 200 attendants 
to the post-run pasta bash. 
 
The First Annual Fall Festival at 
the Daggett County Park in Manila, 
featuring entertainment, a dinner, 
horseshoes and a beneﬁ t auction 
has kicked off a new tradition for the 
county.
