Pence Discusses "A Pledge to America" on Fox and Friends 
U.S. Congressman Mike Pence talked about the governing agenda that House Republicans
proposed today:
  
          
  
Excerpts:
  
“A Pledge to America is going to lay out our agenda for what we’d like to see this
congress right now do to get spending under control, to get this economy moving again,
to protect our nation, to battle against the massive expansion of government that’s been
under way, and to get us back to the ideals and the values of the broad mainstream of
the American people.”
  
On How the American People Drove this Governing Agenda:
  
“I think that the Tea Party movement and the people who’ve attended town hall meetings
over the last year-and-a-half have sent a deafening message to Washington, D.C. that
enough is enough. They want to see us get back to the practice of fiscal responsibility,
personal responsibility and government reform. They want to see us get government
spending under control and get this economy moving again, and they want to see us do
all of that in a way that’s grounded in the freedom and limited government traditions of
this country. So yes, this is a big, big hat tip to all the American people that are standing
up and saying we can do better.”

Pence Discusses "A Pledge to America" on Fox and Friends 
“First and foremost what they’re going to see in the Pledge to America today, which was
not in the original Contract with America, is a statement about the sanctity of life and a
statement about traditional marriage. And I think that’s an important accomplishment for
everyone in this country that cherishes the common values of our country. 
  
“I think it was important that Republicans make an affirmative statement in favor of
traditional marriage in the Pledge to America. We’ve done that. But don’t miss the fact
too, that in the Pledge to America today the American people will see that Republicans
are prepared to commit to deny all public funding for abortion at home and abroad. And
we will work to make that a government-wide ban. And so, different from the original
Contract with America – yes, we deal with spending, with jobs, with government reform,
with security – but we also make a strong affirmation to the broad mainstream traditional
values that really make this country great.”
