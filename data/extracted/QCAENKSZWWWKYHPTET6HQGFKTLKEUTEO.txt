where: 
a=the value in paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(A) of this 
section, 
b=the value in paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(B) of this 
section, 
c=the value in paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(C) of this 
section, 
d=the value in paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(D) of this 
section, and 
e=the value in paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(E) of this

tem has no means for having a sample 
transported and analyzed for HPC by a 
certified laboratory within the req-
uisite time and temperature conditions 
specified by § 141.74(a)(3) and that the

(F) of this section do not apply. 
(iv) A system need not report the 
data listed in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this 
section if all data listed in paragraphs 
(b)(2) (i)–(iii) of this section remain on 
file at the system and the State deter-
mines that the system has submitted 
all the information required by para-
graphs (b)(2) (i)–(iii) of this section for 
at least 12 months. 
(3)(i) Each system, upon discovering 
that a waterborne disease outbreak po-
tentially attributable to that water 
system has occurred, must report that 
occurrence to the State as soon as pos-
sible, but no later than by the end of 
the next business day. 
(ii) If at any time the turbidity ex-
ceeds 5 NTU, the system must consult 
with the primacy agency as soon as 
practical, but no later than 24 hours 
after the exceedance is known, in ac-
cordance with the public notification 
requirements under § 141.203(b)(3). 
(iii) If at any time the residual falls 
below 0.2 mg/l in the water entering the 
distribution system, the system must 
notify the State as soon as possible, 
§ 141.76
Recycle provisions. 
(a) Applicability. All subpart H sys-
tems that employ conventional filtra-
tion or direct filtration treatment and 
that recycle spent filter backwash 
water, thickener supernatant, or liq-
uids from dewatering processes must 
meet the requirements in paragraphs 
(b) through (d) of this section. 
(b) Reporting. A system must notify 
the State in writing by Decemeber 8, 
2003, if the system recycles spent filter 
backwash 
water, 
thickener 
super-
natant, or liquids from dewatering 
processes. This notification must in-
clude, at a minimum, the information 
specified in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of 
this section. 
(1) A plant schematic showing the or-
igin of all flows which are recycled (in-
cluding, but not limited to, spent filter 
backwash 
water, 
thickener 
super-
natant, and liquids from dewatering 
processes), the hydraulic conveyance 
used to transport them, and the loca-
tion where they are re-introduced back 
into the treatment plant. 
(2) Typical recycle flow in gallons per 
minute (gpm), the highest observed 
plant flow experienced in the previous 
year (gpm), design flow for the treat-
ment plant (gpm), and State-approved 
operating capacity for the plant where 
the State has made such determina-
tions. 
(c) Treatment technique requirement. 
Any system that recycles spent filter 
backwash 
water, 
thickener 
super-
natant, or liquids from dewatering 
processes must return these flows 
through the processes of a system’s ex-
isting conventional or direct filtration

ternate location approved by the State 
by June 8, 2004. If capital improve-
ments are required to modify the recy-
cle location to meet this requirement, 
all capital improvements must be com-
pleted no later than June 8, 2006. 
(d) Recordkeeping. The system must 
collect and retain on file recycle flow 
information specified in paragraphs 
(d)(1) through (6) of this section for re-
view and evaluation by the State be-
ginning June 8, 2004. 
(1) Copy of the recycle notification 
and information submitted to the 
State under paragraph (b) of this sec-
tion. 
(2) List of all recycle flows and the 
frequency with which they are re-
turned. 
(3) Average and maximum backwash 
flow rate through the filters and the 
average and maximum duration of the 
filter backwash process in minutes. 
(4) Typical filter run length and a 
written summary of how filter run 
length is determined. 
(5) The type of treatment provided 
for the recycle flow. 
(6) Data on the physical dimensions 
of the equalization and/or treatment 
units, typical and maximum hydraulic 
loading rates, type of treatment chemi-
cals used and average dose and fre-
quency of use, and frequency at which

Subpart I—Control of Lead and 
Copper 
SOURCE: 56 FR 26548, June 7, 1991, unless 
otherwise noted. 
in §§ 141.80 to 141.85 shall take effect on 
December 7, 1992. 
(b) Scope. These regulations establish 
a treatment technique that includes re-
quirements for corrosion control treat-
ment, source water treatment, lead 
service line replacement, and public 
education. 
These 
requirements 
are 
triggered, in some cases, by lead and 
copper action levels measured in sam-
ples collected at consumers’ taps. 
(c) Lead and copper action levels. (1) 
The lead action level is exceeded if the 
concentration of lead in more than 10 
percent of tap water samples collected 
during any monitoring period con-
ducted in accordance with § 141.86 is 
greater than 0.015 mg/L (i.e., if the 
‘‘90th percentile’’ lead level is greater 
than 0.015 mg/L). 
(2) The copper action level is exceed-
ed if the concentration of copper in 
more than 10 percent of tap water sam-
ples collected during any monitoring 
period conducted in accordance with 
§ 141.86 is greater than 1.3 mg/L (i.e., if 
the ‘‘90th percentile’’ copper level is 
greater than 1.3 mg/L). 
(3) The 90th percentile lead and cop-
per levels shall be computed as follows: 
(i) The results of all lead or copper 
samples taken during a monitoring pe-
riod shall be placed in ascending order 
from the sample with the lowest con-
centration to the sample with the high-
est concentration. Each sampling re-
sult shall be assigned a number, as-
cending by single integers beginning 
with the number 1 for the sample with 
the lowest contaminant level. The 
number assigned to the sample with 
the highest contaminant level shall be 
equal to the total number of samples 
taken. 
(ii) The number of samples taken 
during the monitoring period shall be 
multiplied by 0.9. 
(iii) The contaminant concentration 
in the numbered sample yielded by the 
calculation in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) is the 
90th percentile contaminant level. 
(iv) For water systems serving fewer 
than 100 people that collect 5 samples 
per monitoring period, the 90th per-
centile is computed by taking the aver-
age of the highest and second highest 
concentrations. 
§ 141.80
General requirements. 
(a) Applicability and effective dates. (1) 
The requirements of this subpart I con-
stitute the national primary drinking 
water regulations for lead and copper. 
Unless otherwise indicated, each of the 
provisions of this subpart applies to 
community water systems and non- 
transient, non-community water sys-
tems (hereinafter referred to as ‘‘water 
systems’’ or ‘‘systems’’). 
(2) The requirements set forth in 
§§ 141.86 to 141.91 shall take effect on 
July 7, 1991. The requirements set forth
