§ 1.853–2
Effect of election. 
(a) Regulated investment company. A 
regulated investment company making 
a valid election with respect to a tax-
able year under the provisions of sec-
tion 853(a) is, for such year, denied 
both the deduction for foreign taxes 
provided by section 164(a) and the cred-
it for foreign taxes provided by section 
901 with respect to all income, war-
profits, and excess profits taxes (de-
scribed in section 901(b)(1)) which it has 
paid to any foreign country or posses-
sion of the United States. See section 
853(b)(1)(A). However, under section 
853(b)(1)(B), the regulated investment 
company is permitted to add the 
amount of such foreign taxes paid to 
its dividends paid deduction for that 
taxable year. See paragraph (a) of 
§ 1.852–1. 
(b) 
Shareholder. 
Under 
section 
853(b)(2), a shareholder of an invest-
ment company, which has made the 
election under section 853, is, in effect, 
placed in the same position as a person 
directly owning stock in foreign cor-
porations, in that he must include in 
his gross income (in addition to taxable 
dividends actually received) his propor-
tionate share of such foreign taxes paid 
and must treat such amount as foreign 
taxes paid by him for the purposes of 
the deduction under section 164(a) and 
the credit under section 901. For such 
purposes he must treat as gross income 
from a foreign country or possession of 
the United States (1) his proportionate 
share of the taxes paid by the regulated 
investment company to such foreign 
country or possession and (2) the por-
tion of any dividend paid by the invest-
ment company which represents in-
come derived from such sources. 
(c) Dividends paid after the close of the 
taxable year. For additional rules appli-
cable to certain distributions made
