A notice of opposition to the registration sought by the above-
identified application has been filed.  A service copy of the notice of 
opposition was forwarded to applicant (defendant) by the opposer 
(plaintiff).  An electronic version of the notice of opposition is 
viewable in the electronic file for this proceeding via the Board's 
TTABVUE system: http://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?qs=91211474. 
 
Proceedings will be conducted in accordance with the Trademark Rules of 
Practice, set forth in Title 37, part 2, of the Code of Federal 
Regulations ("Trademark Rules").  These rules may be viewed at the 
USPTO's trademarks page:  http://www.uspto.gov/trademarks/index.jsp.  The Board's 
main webpage (http://www.uspto.gov/trademarks/process/appeal/index.jsp) includes 
information on amendments to the Trademark Rules applicable to Board 
proceedings, on Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR), Frequently Asked 
Questions about Board proceedings, and a web link to the Board's manual 
of procedure (the TBMP). 
 
Plaintiff must notify the Board when service has been ineffective, 
within 10 days of the date of receipt of a returned service copy or the 
date on which plaintiff learns that service has been ineffective.  
Plaintiff has no subsequent duty to investigate the defendant's 
whereabouts, but if plaintiff by its own voluntary investigation or 
through any other means discovers a newer correspondence address for 
the defendant, then such address must be provided to the Board.  
Likewise, if by voluntary investigation or other means the plaintiff 
discovers information indicating that a different party may have an 
interest in defending the case, such information must be provided to 
the Board.  The Board will then effect service, by publication in the 
Official Gazette if necessary.  See Trademark Rule 2.118.  In 
circumstances involving ineffective service or return of defendant's 
copy of the Board's institution order, the Board may issue an order 
noting the proper defendant and address to be used for serving that 
party.  
 
Defendant's ANSWER IS DUE FORTY DAYS after the mailing date of this 
order.  (See Patent and Trademark Rule 1.7 for expiration of this or 
any deadline falling on a Saturday, Sunday or federal holiday.)  Other 
deadlines the parties must docket or calendar are either set forth 
below (if you are reading a mailed paper copy of this order) or are 
included in the electronic copy of this institution order viewable in 
the Board's TTABVUE system at the following web address:  
http://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/.  
 
Defendant's answer and any other filing made by any party must include 
proof of service.  See Trademark Rule 2.119.  If they agree to, the 
parties may utilize electronic means, e.g., e-mail or fax, during the 
proceeding for forwarding of service copies.  See Trademark Rule 
2.119(b)(6). 
 
The parties also are referred in particular to Trademark Rule 2.126, 
which pertains to the form of submissions.  Paper submissions, 
including but not limited to exhibits and transcripts of depositions, 
not filed in accordance with Trademark Rule 2.126 may not be given 
consideration or entered into the case file.

As noted in the schedule of dates for this case, the parties are 
required to have a conference to discuss:  (1) the nature of and basis 
for their respective claims and defenses, (2) the possibility of 
settling the case or at least narrowing the scope of claims or 
2 
defenses, and (3) arrangements relating to disclosures, discovery and 
introduction of evidence at trial, should the parties not agree to 
settle the case.  See Trademark Rule 2.120(a)(2).  Discussion of the 
first two of these three subjects should include a discussion of 
whether the parties wish to seek mediation, arbitration or some other 
means for resolving their dispute.  Discussion of the third subject 
should include a discussion of whether the Board's Accelerated Case 
Resolution (ACR) process may be a more efficient and economical means 
of trying the involved claims and defenses.  Information on the ACR 
process is available at the Board's main webpage.  Finally, if the 
parties choose to proceed with the disclosure, discovery and trial 
procedures that govern this case and which are set out in the Trademark 
Rules and Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, then they must discuss 
whether to alter or amend any such procedures, and whether to alter or 
amend the Standard Protective Order (further discussed below).  
Discussion of alterations or amendments of otherwise prescribed 
procedures can include discussion of limitations on disclosures or 
discovery, willingness to enter into stipulations of fact, and 
willingness to enter into stipulations regarding more efficient options 
for introducing at trial information or material obtained through 
disclosures or discovery. 
 
The parties are required to conference in person, by telephone, or by 
any other means on which they may agree.  A Board interlocutory 
attorney or administrative trademark judge will participate in the 
conference, upon request of any party, provided that such participation 
is requested no later than ten (10) days prior to the deadline for the 
conference.  See Trademark Rule 2.120(a)(2).  The request for Board 
participation must be made through the Electronic System for Trademark 
Trials and Appeals (ESTTA) or by telephone call to the interlocutory 
attorney assigned to the case, whose name can be found by referencing 
the TTABVUE record for this case at http://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/.  The 
parties should contact the assigned interlocutory attorney or file a 
request for Board participation through ESTTA only after the parties 
have agreed on possible dates and times for their conference.  
Subsequent participation of a Board attorney or judge in the conference 
will be by telephone and the parties shall place the call at the agreed 
date and time, in the absence of other arrangements made with the 
assigned interlocutory attorney. 
 
The Board's Standard Protective Order is applicable to this case, but 
the parties may agree to supplement that standard order or substitute a 
protective agreement of their choosing, subject to approval by the 
Board.  The standard order is available for viewing at:  
http://www.uspto.gov/trademarks/process/appeal/guidelines/stndagmnt.jsp.  Any party 
without access to the web may request a hard copy of the standard order 
from the Board.  The standard order does not automatically protect a 
party's confidential information and its provisions must be utilized as 
needed by the parties.  See Trademark Rule 2.116(g). 
 
Information about the discovery phase of the Board proceeding is 
available in chapter 400 of the TBMP.  By virtue of amendments to the 
Trademark Rules effective November 1, 2007, the initial disclosures and 
expert disclosures scheduled during the discovery phase are required 
only in cases commenced on or after that date.  The TBMP has not yet 
been amended to include information on these disclosures and the 
parties are referred to the August 1, 2007 Notice of Final Rulemaking 
3 
(72 Fed. Reg. 42242) posted on the Board's webpage.  The deadlines for 
pretrial disclosures included in the trial phase of the schedule for 
this case also resulted from the referenced amendments to the Trademark 
Rules, and also are discussed in the Notice of Final Rulemaking. 
 
The parties must note that the Board allows them to utilize telephone 
conferences to discuss or resolve a wide range of interlocutory matters 
that may arise during this case.  In addition, the assigned 
interlocutory attorney has discretion to require the parties to 
participate in a telephone conference to resolve matters of concern to 
the Board.  See TBMP § 502.06(a) (2d ed. rev. 2004). 
 
The TBMP includes information on the introduction of evidence during 
the trial phase of the case, including by notice of reliance and by 
taking of testimony from witnesses.  See TBMP §§ 703 and 704.  Any 
notice of reliance must be filed during the filing party's assigned 
testimony period, with a copy served on all other parties.  Any 
testimony of a witness must be both noticed and taken during the 
party's testimony period.  A party that has taken testimony must serve 
on any adverse party a copy of the transcript of such testimony, 
together with copies of any exhibits introduced during the testimony, 
within thirty (30) days after the completion of the testimony 
deposition.  See Trademark Rule 2.125. 
 
Briefs shall be filed in accordance with Trademark Rules 2.128(a) and 
(b).  An oral hearing after briefing is not required but will be 
scheduled upon request of any party, as provided by Trademark Rule 
2.129. 
 
If the parties to this proceeding are (or during the pendency of this 
proceeding become) parties in another Board proceeding or a civil 
action involving related marks or other issues of law or fact which 
overlap with this case, they shall notify the Board immediately, so 
that the Board can consider whether consolidation or suspension of 
proceedings is appropriate. 
 
ESTTA NOTE:  For faster handling of all papers the parties need to file 
with the Board, the Board strongly encourages use of electronic filing 
through the Electronic System for Trademark Trials and Appeals (ESTTA).  
Various electronic filing forms, some of which may be used as is, and 
others which may require attachments, are available at http://estta.uspto.gov.
