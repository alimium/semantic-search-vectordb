Walz Praises 30 Jobs Created in Waseca Through ARRA and Federal Loan Funds
Says improvements to wastewater treatment  system necessary for community growth
  
  
Waseca, MN – Today,  Congressman Walz toured two Waseca projects including a project to
install new  sewer pipelines and a new  wastewater sewer treatment plant. The two projects
cost a total of  $16.1 million, $6 million of which came from the American Recovery and 
Reinvestment Act (ARRA).
  
 
  
“I toured the construction in  Waseca today to see firsthand how federal tax dollars granted
through the  American Recovery and Reinvestment Act are being spent,” said Walz.  “I’m 
pleased to report that Waseca has taken the funding and combined with loan  dollars, has
created 30 construction jobs.  Additionally, this project is  important to residents and businesses
because it will curtail the costly sewer  backups that used to result from the outdated sewer
system.  ”
  
 
  
“Revitalizing our infrastructure  is critical to future economic growth in our region and this sewer
and  wastewater treatment upgrade will help make those opportunities available to  Waseca. 
Also, by upgrading the system, Waseca will be able to decrease  drastically the number of
sewer backups into the lake, improving the quality of  life for the residents and tourists who
enjoy using the lake,” concluded  Walz.

Walz Praises 30 Jobs Created in Waseca Through ARRA and Federal Loan Funds
“I am pleased that Congressman  Walz is coming to Waseca to see the upgrades we’re making
to our aging  wastewater infrastructure and see firsthand the quality jobs being created in  our
area.” said Mayor Roy Srp. “The Congressman’s work on the American Recovery  and
Reinvestment Act in Congress helped our community secure $6 million in  funding for this
project which has created 30 jobs.  We all know that this money  churns in our local economy
providing benefits to our local materials providers,  hardware stores, gas stations, restaurants
and main street shops.”
  
 
  
The pipe work is 75%  complete and is expected to be finished by the end of 2009.  The sewer
treatment  plant will be completed by August 2011.  The City of Waseca received $6 million  in
ARRA principle forgiveness and a $9.8 million dollar loan from the PFA for 20  years at 2.63%
interest.
  
 
  
The loan funding for the  project was put together through the Minnesota Public Facilities
Authority’s  Clean Water Revolving Fund.  This fund receives a regular appropriation from the 
federal government, however, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act allowed  them to
increase their investment in Minnesota community wastewater and drinking  water systems by
almost 400 percent.
  
Walz was escorted to the  construction today by Waseca Mayor Roy Srp, Water and
Wastewater Sewer  Superintendent Carl Sunnonberg and Ray LaFond of Bolton &  Menk.
