Population 
A region's economy thrives or dives because of the people who choose to live there. That choice may occur by being 
born there and desiring to stay, or a more deliberate one of choosing to relocate from somewhere else. Monitoring 
change in the size and movement of population is an important barometer of well-being. Some of us monitor these 
changes as an insect might gauge the shifting sands while most don't pay much attention. But the barometer is a good 
metaphor for population change since it can presage more notable events, such as lackluster business attraction due to 
lack of workers.
