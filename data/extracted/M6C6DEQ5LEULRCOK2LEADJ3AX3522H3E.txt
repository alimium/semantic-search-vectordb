TO SUBMIT THE R-55i WELL REPLACEMENT WORK PLAN 
LOS ALAMOS NATIONAL LABORATORY 
EPA ID#NM0890010515 
HWB-LANL-08-025 
Dear Messrs. Maggiore and Mousseau: 
The New Mexico Environment Department (NMED) is in receipt of the United States 
Department of Energy (DOE) and the Los Alamos National Security, L.L.C.'s (collectively, the 
Permittees) document entitled Request for Extension to Submit the R-55i Well Replacement Work 
Plan (Work Plan) dated November 26,2013 and referenced by EP2013-0298. The request has 
been automatically granted because NMED did not respond in writing within ten business days 
as specified in Consent Order Section III.J .2. 
The Permittees request the extension to submit the Work Plan in order to continue focusing 
efforts on accelerating the shipment of aboveground transuranic waste to the Waste Isolation 
Pilot Plant. This is the second extension to submit the Work Plan (the previous extension was 
granted on July 16, 2013). 
The date to submit the Work Plan has been changed from December 15,2013 to June 30,2014, 
as requested. 
Messrs. Maggiore and Mousseau 
January 3, 2014

NMED is concerned over delays that affect the progress of groundwater characterization 
and remediation; however, NMED is aware of the current uncertainties associated with 
the allocation of DOE resources to the Permittees to fund groundwater monitoring and 
cleanup at the Laboratory. The Permittees must notify NMED, within seven days of 
receipt of such information, should funds become available in the future that allow for the 
Work Plan to be submitted prior to June 30, 2014. If funding becomes available, NMED 
may re-evaluate the deadline for completion of this project. 
Should you have any questions, please contact Ben Wear of my staff at (505) 476-6041. 
Sincerely, 
OAftw
