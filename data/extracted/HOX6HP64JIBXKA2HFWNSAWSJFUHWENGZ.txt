Special Education School District Data Profile for 2005-06
The Special Education School District Data Profile is prepared in accordance with the requirement of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). Each State must have 
a State Performance Plan (SPP) to evaluate the State's efforts to meet the requirements and purposes of the implementation of IDEA. The SPP is a six-year plan which describes 
New York State's performance on 20 indicators. States must report annually to the public on the performance of the State in an Annual Performance Report (APR) and each 
school district against the State's targets. New York State's SPP and the APR that describe these indicators in detail are available at 
http://www.vesid.nysed.gov/specialed/spp/home.html .
The following report reflects only quantifiable data collected by the State. Since performance of a school district in any indicator may be the result of unique circumstances within 
a district, readers are encouraged to consider information provided by the district's administration in interpreting these data.
