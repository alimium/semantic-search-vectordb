ORDER GRANTING IN PART COMPLAINANT’S MOTION 
FOR SUMMARY DECISION, DENYING COMPLAINANT’S
MOTION TO COMPEL, AND GRANTING COMPLAINANT’S
MOTION TO SUBSTITUTE COUNSEL
(July 8, 1998)
I.
INTRODUCTION
This case centers around Complainant’s allegations that Respondent Spring & Soon Fashion
Inc. (Spring & Soon) violated the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) by hiring employees
knowing they were unauthorized to work in the United States and by failing to comply with the
employment eligibility verification requirements of the INA.  Complainant also seeks to hold
Respondent Y Plus Corporation d/b/a Y Prus Corporation (Y Plus) responsible for any violations
actually committed by Spring & Soon.  The main issues in this Order are:  
(1)  whether Complainant has demonstrated that there are no genuine issues of
material fact in this case; and
(2)  whether Complainant has demonstrated that it is entitled to judgment as a matter
of law against Spring & Soon and/or Y Plus.
8 OCAHO 1003

This Order disposes of all outstanding motions.  For the reasons discussed in detail below, I find that
Complainant has demonstrated that there are no genuine issues of material fact and that it is entitled
to judgment as a matter of law as to the liability of both Spring & Soon and Y Plus.  However, I find
that Complainant has not demonstrated that there are no genuine issues of material fact with respect
to the amount of penalty this case warrants.  As a result, I 
(1)  GRANT Complainant’s Motion for Summary Decision1 as to liability for both
Spring & Soon and Y Plus; and
(2)  DENY Complainant’s Motion for Summary Decision as to the appropriate civil
money penalty to assess.  
II.
BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY
On September 27, 1996, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS or Complainant)
served  a  Notice  of  Intent  to  Fine  (NIF)  relating  to  Respondent Spring & Soon Fashion Inc. on
Mrs. Young S. Sung at the business premises of Y Plus S Corporation, d/b/a Y Prus S Corporation.
Shofi  Decl.2  ¶  5.   Mrs.  Sung’s  husband,  Mr.  Chang  S.  Sung,  is  listed  as  Spring  &  Soon’s
1  Complainant has entitled its filing a “Motion for Summary Judgment.”  The OCAHO
Rules of Practice and Procedure provide for motions for summary decision, see 28 C.F.R.
§ 68.38 (1997), which are similar to motions for summary judgment under Federal Rule of
Civil Procedure 56.  I will treat Complainant’s Motion as a motion for summary decision, and
I will refer to it as such.

By letter dated October 21, 1996, Spring & Soon timely requested  a  hearing  in  this  matter
through  its  then-attorney  Mark  C.  Kalish.  Complainant filed a five-count Complaint with the
Office of the Chief Administrative Hearing Officer (OCAHO) on May 22, 1997.  That Complaint,
which echoes the allegations of the NIF, asserts that Spring & Soon hired or continued to employ
seven  listed  individuals  knowing  that  they  were  unauthorized  to  work  in  the  United  States,
in   violation   of  section  274A(a)(1)(A)  or  274A(a)(2)  of  the  INA,  as  codified  at  8  U.S.C. §§
1324a(a)(1)(A) and 1324a(a)(2).  Compl. ¶¶ I.A-E.  Complainant alleges that, on August 8, 1995,
a Final Order was served on Respondent Spring & Soon for a first violation of section 274A(a)(1)(A)
and/or 274A(a)(2) of the INA.  Compl. ¶ I.F.  Complainant also alleges that Spring & Soon
committed various violations of the employment eligibility verification system, all in violation of
section 274A of the INA, as codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1324a.  See Compl. ¶¶ II-V.  
On July 23, 1997, Mr. Kalish filed a motion to withdraw his representation of Spring & Soon
in this proceeding.  In support of his motion, Mr. Kalish stated that, after repeated attempts, he had
been unable to communicate with his client.  Specifically, Mr. Kalish said that he had had no
communications with Spring & Soon since approximately January 1997.  Mot. Withdraw ¶ 6.  After
receiving a copy of the Complaint in late May or early June 1997, Mr. Kalish tried to telephone
Spring & Soon, but found that telephone service was disconnected.  Id. ¶ 7.  Mr. Kalish stated that,
on June 16, 1997, he visited Spring & Soon’s business premises at 262 West 38th Street, 15th Floor,
New York, New York, but that the business no longer was there.  Id. ¶ 8.  Mr. Kalish stated that he
then  requested  from  directory  assistance  any  listings  for  “Spring  &  Soon  Fashions”  in  any
of    New   York  City’s  five  boroughs,  but  that  there  were  no  such  listing .  Id. ¶ 9.  Finally,
Mr. Kalish asserted that, to the best of his knowledge, Spring & Soon no longer was doing business.
Id.  I granted Mr. Kalish’s motion to withdraw by order dated July 24, 1997.
Complainant filed its Motion to Amend Complaint and a document entitled “Second
Amended Complaint”3 on September 3, 1997.  Through its proposed amendment, Complainant
sought to add Y Plus S Corporation d/b/a Y Prus S Corporation as a respondent on the grounds that
it was a mere continuation of Respondent Spring & Soon Fashion Inc. and, thus, could be held
responsible  for  the  debts  and/or liabilities of Spring & Soon.  Also on September 3, Complainant
3  According to the official case file, no other amended complaint had been filed. 
Therefore, this was not the second amended complaint but, rather, the first amendment. Thus,
it will be referred to as the amended complaint.  
8 OCAHO 1003

filed its Motion for Default Judgment.  Complainant stated that, as of August 14, 1997, no answer
had been filed in this case.  Mot. Default ¶ 4.  Therefore, Respondent had “failed to plead or
otherwise  defend  within  thirty  days  of  the  receipt  of  [the] Complaint as required by 28 C.F.R.
§ 68.9(a).”  Id. ¶ 5.  Complainant sought default judgment against both Spring & Soon and Y Plus.
On September 11, 1997, I entered an Order Regarding Complainant’s Motion to Amend and
Motion for Default.  In that Order, I noted that Complainant had not explained why Spring & Soon
should be considered as doing business through Y Plus S Corporation d/b/a Y Prus S Corporation,
other than the fact that it might have the same owner.  I ordered Complainant to file a legal brief no
later than September 30, 1997, in which it would discuss the facts in the record that supported its
assertion that Spring & Soon is doing business through Y Plus and the applicable legal principles
governing that determination.  Since the NIF was not served on Spring & Soon at the address listed
for it on the Complaint, I ordered Complainant also to discuss in its brief whether the NIF was
properly served on Spring & Soon.  I granted leave to the Sungs to file a response to Complainant’s
Motion to Amend, its brief, and its Motion for Default Judgment no later than October 14, 1997. 
Regarding Complainant’s Motion for Default, I noted that Spring & Soon still had not filed
an answer as of September 11.  I stated that, if I granted Complainant’s Motion to Amend,
Respondent would have thirty days to answer the amended complaint; even though Spring & Soon
had not yet filed an answer to the original Complaint, if an amended complaint is filed, a  respondent
must receive a chance to answer the complaint as amended.  As a result, I stated that I would defer
ruling on the Motion for Default until I had ruled on the Motion to Amend.  I explained, however,
that Spring & Soon was in default with respect to the original Complaint and, if I denied the Motion
to Amend, Spring & Soon could face a default judgment.  Consequently, I ordered Spring & Soon
to file an answer to the Complaint immediately upon receipt of my September 11 Order to avoid
entry of a default judgment.  I also ordered Spring & Soon to explain why it did not file an answer
to the Complaint in a timely manner.  
Complainant filed its Memorandum of Law in Support of Motion to Amend Complaint on
October 14, 1997.4  On October 17, 1997, Raymond J. Aab filed a Notice of Appearance as legal
counsel for Spring & Soon and also filed Respondent’s Answer to the Complaint and its Opposition
to Complainant’s Motion to Amend Complaint.  Spring & Soon’s Opposition also responded to
Complainant’s Motion for Default Judgment.  In its Answer, Spring & Soon responded to the factual
allegations of the Complaint and asserted as an affirmative defense that the NIF and the Complaint
in this case were not properly served on Spring & Soon. 
4  I granted Complainant’s request, communicated by letter on October 10, 1997, to
extend the previous deadline to October 14.  
8 OCAHO 1003

By Order dated December 9, 1997, I granted Complainant’s Motion to Amend Complaint
by adding Y Plus as a respondent.  Although I did not find that Y Plus was in fact a mere
continuation of Spring & Soon, I granted Complainant’s Motion to Amend by adding Y Plus as a
respondent because Complainant had alleged enough information to allow it the opportunity to prove
its allegations as to Y Plus.  See Order Granting C.’s Mot. Amend at 11.  Also in the December 9
Order, I addressed the issue of whether the NIF was properly served on Respondent Spring & Soon.
For the reasons stated in that Order, I found that, even assuming service was not accomplished in
compliance with the applicable regulation, dismissing the case to make the INS comply with the
relevant regulation was unwarranted.  See id. at 3-8.  Additionally, I denied Complainant’s Motion
for Default and gave Respondents until January 8, 1998, to file their answer to the Amended
Complaint.  
Respondents filed their Answer to the Amended Complaint on January 12, 1998.  Although
the certificate of service reveals that this Answer was served by mail on January 7, 1998, “file”
means that the document must be received in my office by the given deadline, not that it merely must
be postmarked by then, see 28 C.F.R. § 68.8(b) (1997).  I had explicitly reminded Respondents of
that provision, see Order Granting C.’s Mot. Amend at 13 n.13, but they still failed to ensure that
their Answer was filed by the January 8 deadline.  Respondents responded to the allegations
contained  in  the  Amended  Complaint,  see  Ans.  to  Amended  Compl.  ¶¶  1-15,  and  asserted
two affirmative defenses.  As a first affirmative defense, Respondents alleged that service of the NIF
was “not made in compliance with legal requirement.”  Ans. to Amended Compl. ¶ 16.  As a second
affirmative defense, Respondents alleged that “Y Plus S Corporation and/or Y Prus S Corporation
is a separate and distinct entity from [Spring & Soon], and [Spring & Soon] is not responsible for
the liabilities and conduct of Y Plus S Corporation and Y Prus S Corporation and vice versa.”  Ans.
to Amended Compl. ¶ 17.
On April 23, 1998, Complainant filed a Motion for Summary Decision and a Motion to
Compel Response to Request for Production of Documents and Answer to Interrogatories.  In the
Motion for Summary Decision, Complainant asserted that on March 13, 1998, Complainant served
requests for admissions on Respondents (which are attached to its Motion), and that Respondents,
as of April 21, 1998, had not responded to the same.  In the Motion to Compel, Complainant
similarly asserted that it served Respondents with interrogatories and requests for document
production on March 13, and that Respondents had failed to respond to those discovery requests as
of April 21.  
Respondents were entitled to file a response to Complainant’s Motion for Summary Decision
on or before May 6, 1998; they also were entitled to file a response to Complainant’s Motion to
Compel on or before May 7, 1998.  See 28 C.F.R. §§ 68.11(b); 68.8(c)(2) (1997).  Respondents had
filed no responses to either of those Motions by the appropriate deadlines.  On May 8, 1998, I issued
a Show Cause Order (SCO) in which I gave Respondents the opportunity to state whether their
attorney’s office received the requests for admissions and the Motion for Summary Decision, and
when each was received, and to show cause why I should not deem each of the admissions admitted
8 OCAHO 1003
6
by Respondents pursuant to 28 C.F.R. § 68.21(b).  Respondents filed their Response to the SCO on
May 21, 1998.  They attached to the Response copies of their answers to Complainant’s requests for
admissions, as well as their answers to Complainant’s interrogatories and requests for production
of documents, which had been served on Complainant the previous day, on May 20, 1998.
Respondents’ counsel stated several reasons for his failure to respond to Complainant’s discovery
requests in a timely manner, but he never explained why he did not seek an extension of time in
which to answer discovery.  Despite my explicit requirement in the SCO, Respondents’ counsel also
failed  to  state  when  his  office  received  Complainant’s  Request  for Admissions and Motion for
Summary Decision.  Respondents asked that I direct Complainant to accept Respondents’ answers
to its discovery requests.  See R. Response SCO ¶ 4.  Respondents still have not responded to
Complainant’s Motion for Summary Decision.  
On May 27, 1998, Complainant filed a motion to substitute Complainant’s counsel, stating
that INS Assistant District Counsel Mimi Tsankov, who had been handling this case on
Complainant’s behalf, no longer works at the INS.  Complainant also entered a notice of appearance
for INS Assistant District Counsel Paul Szeto.  I noted in my Order Staying Proceeding that
Respondents were entitled to file a response to the substitution motion on or before June 11, 1998.
See 28 C.F.R. §§ 68.11(b), 68.8(c)(2) (1997).  Respondents have not filed such a response.  
By Order dated May 29, 1998, I stayed this proceeding until I ruled on Complainant’s Motion
for Summary Decision.
III.
STANDARDS FOR SUMMARY DECISION
The Rules of Practice and Procedure that govern this proceeding permit the Administrative
Law Judge (ALJ or Judge) to “enter a summary decision for either party if the pleadings, affidavits,
material  obtained  by  discovery  or  otherwise,  or  matters  officially  noticed  show  that  there  is
no genuine issue as to any material fact and that a party is entitled to summary decision.”  28 C.F.R.
§ 68.38(c) (1996).  Although OCAHO has its own procedural rules for cases arising under its
jurisdiction, the OCAHO Rules of Practice specifically authorize the Judge to reference analogous
provisions  of  the  Federal  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure  and  federal  case  law  interpreting  them
for  guidance  in  deciding  issues  based  on  the  rules  governing  OCAHO  proceedings.  OCAHO
Rule 68.38(c) is similar to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c), which provides for summary
judgment in cases before the federal district courts.  As such, Rule 56(c) and federal case law
interpreting it are useful in deciding whether summary decision is appropriate under the OCAHO
rules.  United States v. Aid Maintenance Co., 6 OCAHO 893, at 3 (1996), 1996 WL 73594, at *35

(Ref. No. 821) (1995), 1995 WL 813122, at *2 (Order Granting Complainant’s Motion for Summary
Decision) (citing same).
Facts  are  deemed  material  only  if  they  will  affect  the  outcome  of  the  proceeding.  See
Aid Maintenance, 6 OCAHO 893, at 4, 1996 WL 735954, at *3 (citing Anderson v. Liberty Lobby,
Inc., 477 U.S. 242 (1986)); Tri Component, 5 OCAHO at 768, 1995 WL 813122, at *3 (citing same
and United States v. Primera Enters., Inc., 4 OCAHO 259, 260-61 (Ref. No. 615) (1994), 1994 WL

1989 WL 433857, at * 2 (Order Granting in Part Complainant’s Motion for Summary Decision).
An issue of material fact is genuine if it has a “real basis in the record.”  Tri Component, 5 OCAHO
at 768, 1995 WL 813122, at *3 (citing Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio, 475 U.S. 574,
586-87 (1986)).  In deciding whether a genuine issue of material fact exists, the court must view all
facts and all reasonable inferences to be drawn from them “in the light most favorable to the non-
moving party.”  Id. (citing Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 587 and Primera, 4 OCAHO at 261, 1994 WL
269753, at *2).
The party requesting summary decision carries the initial burden of demonstrating the
absence of any genuine issues of material fact.  Id. (citing Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317,
323 (1986)).  Additionally, the moving party has the burden of showing that it is entitled to judgment
as a matter of law.  United States v. Alvand, Inc., 1 OCAHO 1958, 1959 (Ref. No. 296) (1991), 1991
WL 717207, at *2 (Decision and Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part Complainant’s Motion
for Partial Summary Decision) (citing Richards v. Neilsen Freight Lines, 810 F.2d 898 (9th Cir.
1987)).  After the moving party has met its burden, “the opposing party must then come forward with
‘specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.’” Tri Component, 5 OCAHO at 768,
1995 WL 813122, at *2 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e)).  The party opposing summary decision may
not “rest upon conclusory statements contained in its pleadings.”  Alvand, 1 OCAHO at 1959, 1991
WL 717207, at *2 (citing Nilsson, Robbins, Dalgarn, Berliner, Carson & Wurst v. Louisiana
Hydrolec, 854 F.2d 1538 (9th Cir. 1988)).  The Rules of Practice and Procedure governing OCAHO
proceedings specifically provide: 
6  Citations to OCAHO precedents in bound Volumes 1-2, Administrative Decisions
Under Employer Sanctions and Unfair Immigration-Related Employment Practices Laws of the
United States, and bound Volumes 3-5, Administrative Decisions Under Employer Sanctions,
Unfair Immigration-Related Employment Practices and Civil Penalty Document Fraud Laws of
the United States, reflect consecutive decision and order reprints within those bound volumes;
pinpoint citations to pages within those issuances are to specific pages, seriatim, of the pertinent
volume.  Pinpoint citations to OCAHO precedents in volumes subsequent to Volume 5, however,
are to pages within the original issuances. 
8 OCAHO 1003

[w]hen a motion for summary decision is made and supported as provided in this
section, a party opposing the motion may not rest upon the mere allegations or
denials of such pleading.  Such response must set forth specific facts showing that
there is a genuine issue of fact for the hearing.
28 C.F.R. § 68.38(b) (1997).  
Under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the court may consider any admissions on file
as part of the basis for summary judgment.  Tri Component, 5 OCAHO at 768, 1995 WL 813122,
at *3 (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)).  Similarly, summary decision may be based on matters deemed
admitted.  Id. (citing Primera, 4 OCAHO at 261, 1994 WL 269753, at *2 and United States v.
Goldenfield Corp., 2 OCAHO 162, 165 (Ref. No. 321) (1991), 1991 WL 531744, at *3).  
IV.
LEGAL ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION
A.
Requests for Admissions
Complainant’s  Motion for Summary Decision is based largely on the answers deemed
admitted to its Request for Admissions.  Requests for admissions are deemed admitted if not
responded to within thirty days of service.  See 28 C.F.R. § 68.21(b) (1997); see also Fed. R. Civ.
P. 36(a).7   If  the  requests  for  admission  are  served  by  ordinary  mail,  the  responding party has
five additional days in which to serve its answers and/or objections.  See 28 C.F.R. § 68.8(c)(2)
(1997).  The requests automatically are deemed admitted if the party from whom the admissions are
sought does not respond within the appropriate time limit.  See Beberaggi v. New York City Transit
Auth., No. 93 Civ. 1737 (SWK), 1994 WL 18556, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 19, 1994) (citing, inter alia,
Donovan v. Carls Drug Co., 703 F.2d 650, 651 (2d Cir. 1983)); American Technology Corp. v. Mah,
174  F.R.D.  687,  690  (D. Nev. 1997).  A  motion  to  deem  the  requests  admitted  is  not
necessary.  See Beberaggi, 1994 WL 18556, at *2; Mah, 174 F.R.D. at 690 (denying a motion to
deem requests for admissions admitted on the grounds that it was unnecessary, given the automatic
effect of Rule 36(a)).  
In the present case, Complainant served its Request for Admissions via first class mail on
March 13, 1998.  Respondents’ answers and/or objections to those requests should have been served
on or before April 17, 1998, but Respondents did not do so.  In fact, Respondents did not serve their
7  As the OCAHO rule regarding requests for admissions is very similar to Rule 36,
federal case law interpreting Rule 36 may be informative in construing the provisions of
28 C.F.R. § 68.21.  Cf. United States v. Aid Maintenance Co., 6 OCAHO 893, at 3 (1996), 
1996 WL 73594, at *3 (using Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provisions concerning summary
judgment and federal case law regarding them as guidelines in interpreting similar OCAHO
rules governing summary decision).

answers to the requests for admissions until May 20, 1998, attached as part of its response to my
May 8 Show Cause Order.  When Respondents failed to respond to Complainant’s Request for
Admissions in a timely manner, the matters of which Complainant sought admissions automatically
were deemed admitted.
Admissions can be withdrawn and/or amended, upon motion.  See 28 C.F.R. § 68.21(d)
(1997) (“Any matter admitted under this section is conclusively established unless the
Administrative Law Judge upon motion permits withdrawal or amendment of the admission.”); see
also Fed. R. Civ. P. 36(b).  In their Response to the SCO, Respondents ask that I order Complainant
to accept their responses to Complainant’s discovery requests, including their answers to the requests
for admissions.  See R. Response SCO ¶ 4.  Respondents also state reasons in support of the
requested relief.  See id. ¶ 3.  I will treat Respondents’ Response to the SCO as a motion to withdraw
and  to  amend  their  prior  admissions.  See  Rohman  v.  Chemical  Leaman  Tank  Lines,  Inc., 923
F. Supp. 42, 46 n.2 (S.D.N.Y. 1996) (treating party’s request that its responses to requests for
admissions be deemed timely filed, made in the party’s counsel’s affirmation in opposition to the
opponent’s motion for summary judgment, as a formal Rule 36(b) motion when, among other things,
the grounds upon which the requested relief was sought were “clearly set forth” in the affirmation).
The OCAHO Rules of Practice provide no standard for permitting the withdrawal and/or
amendment of admissions made in the context of requests for admissions.  The Federal Rules of
Civil Procedure, however, provide such a standard.8  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 36(b).  Under the Federal
Rules, the trial judge “may permit withdrawal or amendment when the presentation of the merits of
the action will be subserved thereby and the party who obtained the admission fails to satisfy the
court that withdrawal or amendment will prejudice that party in maintaining the action or defense
on the merits.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 36(b) (emphasis added).  “[T]he decision to excuse [a party] from
its admissions is in the court’s discretion.”  Donovan v. Carls Drug Co., Inc., 703 F.2d 650, 651-52
(2d Cir. 1983).  “Because the language of the Rule is permissive, the court is not required to make
an exception to Rule 36 even if both the merits and prejudice issues cut in favor of the party seeking
exception to the rule.”  Id. at 652; see also American Express Travel Related Servs. Co., Inc. v.
Ladouceur (In re Ladouceur), No. 95-CV-271 (RSP), 1996 WL 596718, at *3 (N.D.N.Y. Oct. 15,
1996); O’Neill v. Medad, 166 F.R.D. 19, 22 (E.D. Mich. 1996) (citing Ropfogel v. United States,
138 F.R.D. 579, 582 (D. Kan. 1991); Carls Drug, 703 F.2d at 652; Coca-Cola Bottling Co. v. Coca-

In the Response to the SCO, Respondents’ attorney, Raymond Aab, gave several reasons for
failing to respond to Complainant’s Request for Admissions in a timely manner.  Mr. Aab stated that
he was unable to respond to Complainant’s discovery requests sooner because “[t]he requests were
quite voluminous and the respondent’s principal and person assisting in obtaining the requested
documents and answers to the discovery requests, Mr. Sung, was unable to obtain much of the
requested documents until May 19th.”  R. Response SCO ¶ 3(a).  Mr. Aab also stated the “process
was rendered more problematic, because Mr. Sung speaks only halting English and he needed to
return to [Respondents’ counsel’s] office three time to assist in the preparation of the respondents’
responses to the discovery requests before he fully understood.”  Id.  Additionally, Mr. Aab stated
that he was engaged in  a  three-week criminal  trial  that  “concerned  allegations  of  fraud  and
involved  very  complicated  issues and facts,” and that his “time was virtually fully occupied with
that trial,” which did not end until 5:30 p.m. on May 19.  Id. ¶ 3(b).  Mr. Aab, however, did not
explain why he did not seek relief from the Court to expand the deadline to respond to
Complainant’s discovery requests.  
Respondents have not shown good cause for failing to respond to Complainant’s Request for
Admissions in a timely manner or for failing to request an extension of time in which to respond.
As of May 20, the date on the Response, Mr. Aab stated that he had “been engaged in a criminal trial
and proceedings . . . for the past three weeks.”  Id.  Given that time frame, Mr. Aab’s trial would
have started sometime in the last week of April.  Respondents’ response to the Request for
Admissions was due April 17.  Mr. Aab’s trial did not begin until more than one week after the
response was due.  The fact that a trial monopolized Mr. Aab’s time for the three weeks between the
last week in April and May 20 explains nothing about why Mr. Aab failed to respond to
Complainant’s Request for Admissions by the middle of April.  Mr. Aab could have asked for an
extension of time, but he did not.  
The need to answer other discovery requests also did not excuse Respondents’ obligation to
respond to Complainant’s Request for Admissions.  Mr. Aab cited a delay in the ability to obtain
requested documents as a reason for failing to respond to Complainant’s discovery requests in a
timely fashion.  See id. ¶ 3(a).  Any delay in obtaining the necessary documents, however, did not
justify a delay in responding to the Request for Admissions.  
Complainant’s Request for Admissions was not voluminous.  When Respondents finally
responded to the requests, they denied most of them.  Respondents did not need two months to
answer the Request for Admissions.  
Finally, Respondents did not bother to respond to Complainant’s Request for Admissions
until prompted by my May 8 SCO.  Not only did Mr. Aab let the deadline for responding to the
Request pass, but he persisted in his lack of attention and action when Complainant filed its Motion
for Summary Decision, which was based in large part on the admitted requests.  The Motion notified
Respondents’ counsel that Complainant was seeking judgment based on the matters admitted when
Respondents failed to answer the Request for Admissions by the deadline.  Despite the seriousness
of this action, Respondents’ counsel did not immediately answer the Request and move to permit
8 OCAHO 1003
11
Respondents to withdraw and to amend their admissions.  Not only did Respondents fail to act with
the urgency that this case deserved, but they persisted in their neglect until prompted by my SCO.
Although Respondents finally answered the Request for Admissions, they never have responded to
Complainant’s Motion for Summary Decision.  
Courts have concluded there are situations in which it would not “further the interests of
justice” to “deem a central fact to have been admitted by the failure of [a] pro se defendant to
respond” to requests for admissions.  See Local Union No. 38, Sheet Metal Workers’ Int’l Ass’n,
AFL-CIO v. Tripodi, 913 F. Supp. 290, 294 (S.D.N.Y. 1996).  I generally agree with that philosophy,
but that factual scenario is not the situation in this case.  Respondents are represented by an attorney
whose duty it is to advise them in legal matters and actively pursue their interests within the bounds
of the law.  Allowing Respondents to withdraw and amend their admissions under the present
circumstances would itself work an injustice by rewarding the glaring disregard of rules designed
to promote fairness and efficiency in the legal process.  Cf. Alexander v. Commissioner of Internal
Revenue, 926 F.2d 197, 199 (2d Cir. 1991) (stating, in the context of affirming the trial court’s
decisions not to permit the late filing of answers to the requests for admissions and to grant summary
judgment based on matters deemed admitted, that “[i]t is not the role of appellate courts to make
allowances for the patent disregard of clearly stated trial court rules that are in part designed to
provide for the expeditious conclusion of litigation”).  All the matters about which Complainant
sought admissions in its Request for Admissions were admitted when Respondents failed to respond
to the Request in a timely manner; all those items deemed admitted stay admitted.
Respondents did not answer the Request for Admissions in time, and, when they did answer,
did not raise any objections to the requests.  Arguably, any potential objections that Respondents
might have raised were waived.  Cf. Boyle v. Leviton Mfg. Co., Inc., 94 F.R.D. 33, 36 (S.D. Ind.
1981) (by answering and not objecting to requests for admissions, party waived objections for
purposes of later raising them as a bar to being assessed attorney’s fees for failure to admit); Pleasant
Hill Bank v. United States, 60 F.R.D. 1, 4 n.1 (W.D. Mo. 1973) (by answering request for admission,
party waived objection that it later raised in brief opposing motion for summary judgment).  
Even if  objections had not been waived,  the  requests  for  admissions  in  this  case  appear
to be proper.  A couple of Complainant’s requests, that Y Plus is a successor in interest of Spring
& Soon and that Y Plus is a mere continuation of Spring & Soon’s business, C. Request Admiss.
Sec. I ¶¶ 17, 23, presented the potential issue of whether they called for pure conclusions of law.  
Rule  36  was  amended  in  1970  to  resolve  a  conflict “in the court decisions as to whether
a  request to admit matters of ‘opinion’ and matters involving ‘mixed law and fact’ is proper under
the rule.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 36 advisory committee’s note.  Rule 36 now states that requests for
admissions  may  “relate  to  statements  or  opinions  of  fact  or  of  the  application  of  law  to
fact,”  Fed.  R.  Civ. P. 36(a), thereby “eliminat[ing] the requirement that the matters be ‘of fact,’”
see Fed. R. Civ. P. 36 advisory committee’s note.  
8 OCAHO 1003
12
Requests that call for a pure conclusion of law are improper, but requests that ask for a
conclusion of law in relation to the facts of the actual case at hand are acceptable.  See Abbott v.
United States, 177 F.R.D. 92, 93 (N.D.N.Y. 1997); Fed. R. Civ. P. 36 advisory committee’s note
(“The amended provision does not authorize requests for admissions of law unrelated to the facts
of the case.”); see also Audiotext Communications Network, Inc. v. US Telecom, Inc., No. Civ. A.
No. 94-2395-GTV, 1995 WL 625744, at *6 (D. Kan. 1995) (requests that seek application of law
to the facts of the case are acceptable).  Allowing requests that call for conclusions of law in relation
to the facts of the case meets the Rule 36 objective of narrowing the disputed issues in the case.  See
Fed. R. Civ. P. 36 advisory committee’s note (“An admission of a matter involving the application
of law to fact may, in a given case, even more clearly narrow the issues.”); Leviton Mfg., 94 F.R.D.
at 35-36.  In a related vein, “[t]here is nothing improper about a request simply because it goes to
an ultimate fact that may be dispositive of the case . . . .”  Hart v. Dow Chemical, No. 95 C 1811
1997 WL 627645, at *8 (N.D. Ill. Sept. 30, 1997).
In Abbott, a party requested admissions of law that were based exclusively on hypothetical
facts given in the requests.  See Abbott, 177 F.R.D. at 93.  The court ruled that such requests were
improper:  
Although admittedly the boundary line is not always plain between
permissible questions relating to the application of law to fact and objectionable
questions relating to pure questions of law, the questions posed by plaintiff in this
case fall outside the bounds of proper discovery.  Most telling is that plaintiffs have
not posed proper questions requiring application of law to the facts peculiar to this
case to clarify the government’s legal theories; rather, plaintiffs have posed improper
hypothetical factual scenarios unrelated to the facts here to ascertain answers to pure
questions of law.  This they cannot do.  
Id.  
In the present case, Complainant has not posed requests for admissions based on hypothetical
scenarios.  The requests regarding Y Plus’ status as a successor in interest to and mere continuation
of Spring & Soon involve conclusions of law, but in relation to the facts of this case.  That is
something Rule 36 clearly permits since its 1970 amendment.9  
9  Some post-1970 cases still say that requests that call for legal conclusions, even in
relation to the facts of the case, or that go to central facts in dispute are improper.  See, e.g.,
Whitaker v. Belt Concepts of America, Inc. (In re Olympia Holding Corp.), 189 B.R. 846, 853
(Bankr. M.D. Fla. 1995).  Those cases, however, cite to pre-1970 case law, or to other post-1970
cases that cite to pre-1970 case law, in support of their position.

B.
Liability Issues
To rule on Complainant’s Motion for Summary Decision, I must examine whether
Complainant has demonstrated a lack of genuine issue of material fact and is entitled to judgment
as a matter of law.  “[I]t is well settled that a failure to respond to a request for admissions will
permit the district court to enter summary judgment if the facts admitted by operation of Rule 36(a)
are dispositive of the case.”  Pleasant Hill Bank v. United States, 60 F.R.D. 1 (W.D. Mo. 1973)
(citing, inter alia, Moosman v. Blitz, Inc., 358 F.2d 686, 688 (2d Cir. 1966)); see also Donovan v.
Carls Drug Co., Inc., 703 F.2d 650, 651 (2d Cir. 1983).  “[A]dmissions under Rule 36, even those
made upon a party’s default in responding, may serve as the factual predicate for summary
judgment.”  Pakistan Int’l Airlines v. Travel Link Int’l, Ltd., No. 90 CIV. 1703 (PNL), 1991 WL
130182, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. July 9, 1991) (citing Carls Drug, 703 F.2d at 651).
1.
Liability of Spring & Soon
a.
Count I: knowing hire/continue to hire
In Count I of the Complaint, Complainant alleges that Respondent Spring & Soon hired
seven named individuals for employment in the United States after November 6, 1986, that those
seven employees were aliens not authorized for employment in the United States, and that
Respondent hired those employees knowing that they were aliens not authorized to work in the
United States, in violation of section 274A(a)(1)(A) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. § 1324a(a)(1)(A).
Amended Compl. ¶¶ I.A-D.  Alternatively, Complainant alleges that Respondent continued to
employ the seven individuals knowing that they were aliens not authorized for employment in the
United States, in violation of section 274A(a)(2) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. § 1324A(a)(2), and 8 C.F.R.
§  274a.3.   Id.  ¶  I.E.  It  is  unlawful  for  a  person  or  other  entity  to  hire  for  employment in
the United States an alien knowing the alien is unauthorized for employment in the United States,
8 U.S.C. § 1324a(a)(1)(A) (1994), and/or to continue to employ an alien already hired knowing the
alien is unauthorized for employment in the United States, id. § 1324a(a)(2).
Respondents have admitted that the seven individuals listed in Count I were illegal aliens
unauthorized to work in the United States at the time of hire, see C. Request Admiss. Sec. V, and
that Spring & Soon hired them knowing they were unauthorized for employment, see C. Request
Admiss. Sec. I ¶ 15.  The seven individuals were hired after November 6, 1986, as alleged in the
Complaint, because Spring & Soon was not incorporated until after that date.  See C. Request
Admiss. Ex. E10 (Mrs. Sung signed Spring & Soon’s Certificate of Incorporation on October 22,
1991).
10  Respondents have admitted that the document attached to Complainant’s Request 
or Admissions as Exhibit E, Spring & Soon’s Certificate of Incorporation, is genuine.  See
C. Request Admiss. Sec. VI.  
8 OCAHO 1003
14
In  relation to Count I, Complainant has demonstrated the absence of genuine issues of
material fact and that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  I find that Spring & Soon violated
8 U.S.C. § 1324a(a)(1)(A) by knowingly hiring the seven individuals named in Count I.  I GRANT
Complainant’s  Motion  for  Summary  Decision  with  respect  to  Spring  &  Soon’s  liability  for
Count I.
b.
Count II: failure to prepare/present I-9 forms
In Count II, Complainant alleges that Respondent hired five individuals for employment in
the United States after November 6, 1986, and that Respondent failed to prepare the Employment
Eligibility Verification Form (I-9 form) for those five employees, in violation of section
274A(a)(1)(B) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. § 1324a(a)(1)(B).  Amended Compl. ¶¶ II.A, B, D.
Alternatively,  Complainant  alleges  that  Respondent  failed  to  present  the  I-9  forms  for  those
five individuals at a scheduled inspection, in violation of section 274A(a)(1)(B) of the INA, 8 U.S.C.
§ 1324a(a)(1)(B).  Id. ¶¶ II.C, E.  An employer must prepare an I-9 form for each employee hired
after November 6, 1986, see 8 U.S.C. §§ 1324a(a)(1)(B), (b)(1) (1994); 8 C.F.R. §§ 274a.2(a),
(b)(1)(i),  (b)(1)(ii)  (1996),  and  present  any  such  I-9  forms  at  INS  inspections,  see  8  U.S.C.
§§ 1324a(a)(1)(B), (b)(3) (1994); 8 C.F.R. § 274a.2(b)(2)(ii) (1997).
In its Answer to the Amended Complaint, Spring & Soon admits it “employed persons who
identified themselves as indicated in the Complaint, or by different names.”  Ans. to Amended
Compl. ¶ 3.  Respondents have admitted that Spring & Soon did not prepare and/or present at the
January 26, 1996, scheduled inspection I-9 forms for the five listed people.  See C. Request Admiss.
Sec. 1 ¶¶ 4, 9; Sec. IV.  Spring & Soon admits that it hired the five people name in Count II.  Since
Spring & Soon was not incorporated until after November 6, 1986, it may be inferred that the hiring
took place after that date.
There are no genuine issues of material fact regarding Count II’s allegation of failure to
prepare and/or present I-9 forms at the scheduled inspection, and Complainant is entitled to judgment
as a matter of law.  Therefore, I GRANT Complainant’s Motion as to Spring & Soon’s liability for
Count II.
c.
Count III: Sections one and two
In Count III, Complainant alleges that Respondent hired twenty-three individuals for
employment in the United States after November 6, 1986, that Respondent failed to ensure that those
twenty-three individuals properly completed section one of the I-9 form, and that Respondent failed
to properly complete section two of the I-9 form for those employees, in violation of section
274A(a)(1)(B) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. § 1324a(a)(1)(B).  Amended Compl. ¶¶ III.A-D.  An employer
must  ensure  that  its  employees  properly  complete  section  one  of their respective I-9 forms, see
8 U.S.C. §§ 1324a(a)(1)(B), (b)(2) (1994); 8 C.F.R. § 274a.2(b)(1)(i)(A) (1997), and an employer
must properly complete section two of the I-9 form, see 8 U.S.C. §§ 1324a(a)(1)(B), (b)(1) (1994);
8 C.F.R. § 274a.2(b)(1)(ii)(B) (1997).
8 OCAHO 1003
15
Respondents have admitted that the I-9 forms attached as Exhibit A to Complainant’s
Request for Admissions are genuine and relate to the named individuals.  See C. Request Admiss.
Sec. II.  The I-9 forms reveal errors in sections one and two for all twenty-three listed people.
Section one lacks the required attestation11 for all twenty-three people.  One I-9 form, that belonging
to Bokyon Cheon (¶ III.A.4),  has the “lawful permanent resident” box marked, but the employee
failed to include the required alien number.  All of the other I-9 forms have no attestation boxes
marked, and “none” typed or written in the blank for alien numbers.
In section two, all twenty-three forms lack sufficient documentation in List A or Lists B and
C.  An employer must verify an employee’s identity and employment eligibility by examining and
recording information in section two about a List A document,12 or by examining and recording
information in section two about both a List B document13 and a List C document.14  See 8 U.S.C.
§ 1324a(b)(1)(A) (1994); 8 C.F.R. § 274a.2(b)(1)(v) (1997).    Two I-9 forms, belonging to Bokyon
Cheon (¶ III.A.4) and Rosa Maria Fournier (¶ III.A.9), contain social security card information in
List C, but have no document information in List B and List A.15  One form, belonging to Pedro
Cabrera (¶ III.A.1), displays “I.D. requested” typed under List A, and Lists B and C are completely
blank.  All of the remaining I-9 forms in Count III have “I.D. requested” typed in List A and “none”
typed in Lists B and C.
The twenty-three individuals named in Count III were hired after November 6, 1986, as
alleged in the Complaint, because Spring & Soon was not incorporated until after that date, and
because the dates of hire listed in section two on all the forms fall after that date.  Evidence on the
11  In section one, the employee must attest, by marking the appropriate box, to one of 
the following: (1) that he or she is a citizen or national of the United States; (2) that he or she
is a lawful permanent resident; or (3) that he or she is an alien authorized to work until a
designated date.  If the employee marks one of the latter two options, then he or she also must
include his or her alien number in the space provided.  See Form I-9, OMB No. 1115-0136
(rev. Nov. 21, 1991).  
12  List A documents establish both identity and employment eligibility.
 Acceptable List A documents are noted at 8 U.S.C. § 1324a(b)(1)(B) (1994) and
8 C.F.R. § 274a.2(b)(1)(v)(A) (1997).  
13 List B documents establish identity only.  Acceptable List B documents are noted at
8 U.S.C. § 1324a(b)(1)(D) (1994) and 8 C.F.R. § 274a.2(b)(1)(v)(B) (1997).  
14  List C documents establish employment eligibility only.  Acceptable List C documents
are noted at 8 U.S.C. § 1324a(b)(1)(C) (1994) and 8 C.F.R. § 274a.2(b)(1)(v)(C) (1997).  
15  Instead, those two I-9 forms contain the words “I.D. requested” under List A and
“none” under List B.  
8 OCAHO 1003
16
face of the forms reveals that section one lacks the required attestation and that the documentation
portion of section two lacks essential document information.  As there are no genuine issues of
material fact in relation to Count III, and as Complainant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law,
I GRANT Complainant’s Motion with respect to Spring & Soon’s liability for this count.
d.
Count IV: Section two
In Count IV, Complainant alleges that Respondent hired one individual for employment in
the United States after November 6, 1986, and failed to properly complete section two of the I-9
form for that individual, in violation of section 274A(a)(1)(B) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. § 1324a(a)(1)(B).
Amended Compl. ¶¶ IV.A-C.  An employer must properly complete section two of the I-9 form.  See
8 U.S.C. §§ 1324a(a)(1)(B), (b)(1) (1994); 8 C.F.R. § 274a.2(b)(1)(ii)(B) (1997).  
Respondents  have  admitted  that  the  I-9  form  for  this  individual,  attached  as  part  of
Exhibit A of Complainant’s Request for Admissions, is genuine and relates to the individual.  See
C. Request Admiss. Sec. II.  Section two of this employee’s I-9 form lacks sufficient documentation.
Under List A, “petition approved” appears in the space designated for the document title, “I.N.S.”
appears in the space designated for the issuing authority, and “I.D. requested” appears in the space
designated for the document number.  A photocopy of a Form I-797 accompanies this I-9 form, but
attaching a copy of the document to the I-9 form without filling in all the necessary information on
the face of the I-9 form does not satisfy the documentation recording requirement, see United States
v. Corporate Loss Prevention Assocs., 6 OCAHO 908, at 6 (February 5, 1997), 1997 WL 131365,
at *4 (Modification by the Chief Administrative Hearing Officer of Administrative Law Judge’s
Order).   At  any  rate,  a   Form   I-797  is  not  an  acceptable  List  A  document.   See  8 U.S.C. §
1324a(b)(1)(B) (1994); 8 C.F.R. § 274a.2(b)(1)(v)(A) (1997).  In addition, this I-9 form contains the
word “none” in Lists B and C.  
The employee in question was hired after November 6, 1986, as shown by the facts that the
date of hire noted in section two of her I-9 form falls after that date, and that Spring & Soon was not
incorporated until after that date.  Evidence on the face of the I-9 form that necessary elements are
missing in section two demonstrates that Spring & Soon failed in its duty to properly complete
section two.  As there are no genuine issues of material fact in relation to Count IV, and as
Complainant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, I GRANT Complainant’s Motion as to
Spring & Soon’s liability for this count.  
e.
Count V: Section one
In Count V, Complainant alleges that Respondent hired one individual for employment in
the United States after November 6, 1986, and failed to ensure that individual properly completed
section  one  of   his   I-9   form,   in  violation  of  section  274A(a)(1)(B)  of  the  INA,  8  U.S.C.
8 OCAHO 1003
17
§ 1324a(a)(1)(B).  Amended Compl. ¶¶ V.A-C.  An employer must ensure that its employees
properly complete section one of their respective I-9 forms.  See 8 U.S.C. §§ 1324a(a)(1)(B), (b)(2)
(1994); 8 C.F.R. § 274a.2(b)(1)(i)(A) (1997).  
Respondents  have  admitted  that  the  I-9  form  for  this  individual,  attached  as  part  of
Exhibit A of Complainant’s Request for Admissions, is genuine and that it relates to the individual.
See C. Request Admiss. Sec. II.  Section one of this I-9 form lacks the required attestation.  No
attestation boxes are marked, and “none” appears in the space designated for an alien number.  
The employee in question was hired after November 6, 1986, as evidenced by the facts that
the date of hire listed in section two of his I-9 form falls after that date, and that Spring & Soon was
not incorporated until after that date.  Evidence on the face of the I-9 form that the necessary
attestation is missing in section one demonstrates that Spring & Soon failed in its duty to make sure
that the employee properly completed section one.  As there are no genuine issues of material fact
in relation to Count V, and as Complainant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, I GRANT
Complainant’s Motion with respect to Spring & Soon’s liability for this count.  
2.
Liability of Y Plus (as successor in interest of Spring & Soon)
Respondents admit that Y Plus is successor in interest to Spring & Soon.  See C. Request
Admiss. Sec. I ¶ 17.  A successor corporation generally is not responsible for the debts and liabilities
of its predecessor.  See R.C.M. Executive Gallery Corp. v. Rols Capital Co., 901 F. Supp. 630, 635
(S.D.N.Y. 1995); Delgado v. Matrix-Churchill Co., 613 N.Y.S.2d 242, 243 (App. Div. 1994).  Under
New York state law, there  are  four  exceptions  to  that  general  rule:  (1)  when  the  successor
corporation expressly or  impliedly  assumes  such  liability;  (2)  when  there  is  a  de  facto
consolidation  or  merger of the two corporations; (3) when the second corporation is a mere
continuation of the first; or (4) when the transaction was fraudulently executed to escape such
obligations.  Delgado, 613 N.Y.S.2d at 243 (citing Grant-Howard Assocs. v. General Housewares
Corp., 63 N.Y.2d 291, 296, 482 N.Y.S.2d 225 (1984); Schumacher v. Richards Shear Co., 59 N.Y.2d
239, 244 (1983)).
At least one federal court questions whether state or federal law should be applied to
determine successor liability for federal causes of action.16  See Rols Capital, 901 F. Supp. at 634.
As in Rols Capital, however, that distinction does not matter for present purposes because New York
state law and federal law recognize the same four exceptions to the general rule of not holding a
successor corporation liable for the debts of its predecessor.  See id. at 635.  Like the New York
courts,   federal   courts   will  impose  successor  liability   when   any   of   the   previously   stated
16  The court in Rols Capital, however, found it unnecessary to decide that question
because the New Jersey state law that it was applying recognizes the same four exceptions 
to the general non-liability rule that courts have applied to federal claims.  See Rols Capital, 
901 F. Supp. at 635.  
8 OCAHO 1003
18
four exceptions are present, see id. at 635-36; Lumbard v. Maglia, Inc., 621 F. Supp. 1529, 1534-35
(S.D.N.Y. 1985); see also Golden State Bottling Co., Inc. v. NLRB, 414 U.S. 168, 182 n.5 (1973).17
Respondents have admitted that Y Plus is a mere continuation of Spring & Soon’s business.
See C. Request Admiss. Sec. I ¶ 23.  Respondents also have admitted sufficient facts that would
justify the legal conclusion that Y Plus is a mere continuation of Spring & Soon and, thus, will be
held responsible for Spring & Soon’s liabilities. 
A variety of factors are considered in determining whether a successor corporation is a mere
continuation of the predecessor,18 such as the following: 
(1) continuity of ownership; (2) a cessation of ordinary business and dissolution of
the predecessor as soon as practically and legally possible; (3) assumption by the
successor of the liabilities ordinarily necessary for the uninterrupted continuation of
the business of the predecessor; and (4) a continuity of management, personnel,
physical location, assets, and general business operation.  
Lumbard, 621 F. Supp. at 1535 (citing Arnold Graphics Indus., Inc. v. Electronic Tabulating Corp.,
775 F.2d 38 (2d Cir. 1985)).  Not all of these factors are needed to show that a successor corporation
is a mere continuation of the predecessor.   Id.  at 1535  (citing Menacho v. Adamson United Co.,
420 F. Supp. 128, 133 (D.N.J. 1976)). 
17  Successor liability may be even broader in the federal context.  The Seventh Circuit
states that, “in order to protect federal rights or effectuate federal policies, [successor liability]
allows lawsuits against even a genuinely distinct purchaser of a business if (1) the successor
had notice of the claim before the acquisition; and (2) there was a ‘substantial continuity in the
operation of the business before and after the sale.’” Chicago Truck Drivers, Helpers &
Warehouse Workers Union (Independent) Pension Fund v. Tasemkin, Inc., 59 F.3d 48, 49
(7th Cir. 1995); see also Rols Capital, 901 F. Supp. at 635 n.4 (noting the use of this additional
exception in the Seventh Circuit and stating that it is used “when the vindication of an important
statutory policy necessitates the creation of this additional and even broader exception to the
common-law nonliability rule”). 
18  Lumbard uses the same factors to determine whether a corporation is a mere
continuation of another corporation as it does to determine whether the de facto merger exception
applies, although it notes that another district court tries to draw a distinction between the two in
that “a de facto merger contemplates a selling corporation and a purchasing corporation, [but] ‘a
continuation accomplishes . . . something in the nature of a corporate reorganization, rather than
a mere sale.’” Lumbard, 621 F. Supp. at 1535 n.8 (quoting Ladjevardian v. Laidlaw-Coggeshall,
Inc., 431 F. Supp. 834, 839 (S.D.N.Y. 1977)).

Respondents have admitted that Y Plus has the same directors, officers and shareholders as
Spring & Soon.  See C. Request Admiss. Sec. I ¶¶ 30-32. They also have admitted that Y Plus
acquired all or most of Spring & Soon’s assets for cash, see id. Sec. I ¶ 18, that Y Plus paid little or
no consideration for the transfer of assets to itself from Spring & Soon, see id. Sec. I ¶ 22, and that
Spring & Soon was unable to pay its creditors’ claims following the transfer of assets to Y Plus, see
id. Sec. I ¶ 21.  
Respondents have admitted that Y Plus was formed shortly before the time of acquisition of
Spring & Soon’s assets, see id. Sec. I ¶ 20, and that Spring & Soon ceased business operations and
dissolved shortly after Spring & Soon transferred its assets to Y Plus, see id. Sec. I ¶ 19.
Respondents admitted that Y Plus filed for incorporation in New York on February 22, 1996, and
that Spring & Soon ceased doing business the following month, during March 1996.  See id. Sec.
I ¶¶ 45-46.  
Spring & Soon and Y Plus share a common business type and even some employees.  As a
result of Respondents’ admissions, it is conclusively determined that Y Plus manufactures the same
or similar product as Spring & Soon and that Y Plus uses Spring & Soon production facilities.  See
id. Sec. I ¶¶ 24-25.  Specifically, Spring & Soon and Y Plus both engaged and/or engage in the
business of garment manufacturing.  See id. Sec. I ¶¶ 43-44.  Respondents have admitted that some
employees that worked for Spring & Soon worked for Y Plus.  See id. Sec. I. ¶ 26.  In particular,
Respondents admitted that Y Plus hired the following two employees of Spring & Soon: Bernardo
Perez-R, aka Gilberto Quechol Paccheco, and Maria Rosario Gracia, aka Rosa Garcia-Tenecela.  See
id. Sec. I ¶ 27.  In addition, Respondents admit that Y Plus uses Spring & Soon’s business goodwill,
see id. Sec. I ¶ 29, that Y Plus holds itself out as the effective continuation of Spring & Soon, see
id. Sec. I ¶ 35, and that Y Plus uses the same corporate or product name as Spring & Soon, see id.
Sec. I ¶ 36.  
Respondents admit that Mr. Sung owned Spring & Soon, see id. Sec. I ¶ 38.  They also admit
that  he  holds  or  has  held  stock  in  Y  Plus, see id. Sec. I ¶ 34, and that he works at and has held
a management position at Y Plus, see id. Sec. I ¶¶ 41-42.  Respondents admit that Mrs. Sung owns
Y Plus, see id. Sec. I ¶ 37, but also that she held stock in, worked at, and held a management position
at Spring & Soon, see id. Sec. I ¶¶ 33, 39-40.  
Additionally, Y Plus filed for incorporation approximately one month after the NIF was
served on Spring & Soon.  See C. Request Admiss. Sec. I ¶ 45; C. Request Admiss. Ex. G (Y Plus
Certificate of Incorporation); NIF at 2.  All of the above facts provide ample basis for concluding
that Y Plus is a mere continuation of Spring & Soon.  
As a result of Respondents’ admissions, there are no genuine issues of material fact with
respect to the issue of whether Y Plus is a mere continuation of Spring & Soon and, thus, is
responsible  for  Spring  &  Soon’s  liabilities.   Complainant  has  demonstrated  that it  is entitled
to judgment as a matter of law that Y Plus is a mere continuation of Spring & Soon and that Y Plus
8 OCAHO 1003
20
is accountable for Spring & Soon’s liabilities in this case.  Consequently, I GRANT Complainant’s
Motion for Summary Decision as to Y Plus’ liability for Counts I-V of the Amended Complaint.
C.
Penalty Issues
In its Motion for Summary Decision, Complainant asks me to award a civil money penalty
in the full amount requested in the Amended Complaint.  See C. Mot. SD at 3.  Interestingly enough,
Complainant does not ask, in its Motion for Summary Decision, for the imposition of a cease and
desist order; Complainant seeks such an order in the Amended Complaint.  
1.
Substantive violations
A first-time violator of the knowing hire provision under 8 U.S.C. § 1324a(1)(A) shall
receive  an  order  to  cease  and  desist  from such violations and to pay a civil money penalty of not
less than   $250  and  not  more  than  $2,000  for  each  unauthorized  alien  knowingly  hired.   See
8 U.S.C. § 1324a(e)(4)(A)(i) (1994).  For a violator of the knowing hire provision who previously
has been subject to one order for a knowing hire or continue to employ violation, the INA mandates
a cease and desist order and a civil money penalty of not less than $2,000 and not more than $5,000
for each unauthorized alien knowingly hired.  See id. § 1324a(e)(4)(A)(ii).  
Complainant seeks a total penalty of $30,800 for the seven violations contained in Count I,
which it says breaks down into $4,440 for each of the seven violations.  See Amended Compl. at 3.
First of all, Complainant’s calculation does not compute.  If Complainant is seeking a total civil
money penalty with respect to Count I of $30,800, then it would be requesting $4,400, not $4,440,
for each of the seven violations.  If Complainant is seeking $4,440 for each of the seven violations,
however, then the total requested penalty would be $31,080.
Secondly, in its Motion, Complainant does not discuss any factors that support the penalty
amount requested, whether it is $4,400 or $4,440 per violation.  Complainant demonstrates that the
$2,000 through $5,000 per violation range is appropriate in this case,19 but it does not establish why
either $4,400 or $4,440 should be the appropriate level within that range.  
19  Spring & Soon previously has been the subject of a Final Order issued by the INS
pursuant to a settlement agreement between Spring & Soon and the INS stemming from
allegations raised against Spring & Soon in a prior investigation.  See C. Request Admiss. Ex. C
(Final Order), Ex. D (Settlement Agreement).  Respondents have admitted to the genuineness of
those two documents.  See C. Request Admiss. Sec. VII.  In the Settlement Agreement, Spring &
Soon and the INS specifically agreed “that future violations of Section 274A of the [INA] by the
employer will be treated as a second or subsequent offense.”  C. Request Admiss. Ex. D ¶ 3.  The
Settlement Agreement also provided that the INS Final Order “is a final and unappealable order
pursuant to [INA] Section 274A(e)(3)(B),” and that it “shall have the same force and effect as an
Order made after a full hearing.”  C. Request Admiss. Ex. D ¶ 6.  
8 OCAHO 1003
21
2.
Verification violations
A  person  or  entity  who  violates  the  employment  eligibility  verification  system  under
8 U.S.C. § 1324a(1)(B) shall receive “a civil money penalty in an amount of not less than $100 and
not more than $1,000 for each individual with respect to whom such violation occurred.”  8 U.S.C.
§ 1324a(e)(5) (1994).  The statute mandates five factors that must be considered when setting a civil
money penalty for verification violations: (1) size of the business; (2) good faith; (3) seriousness of
the violations; (4) whether the individual was an unauthorized alien; and (5) history of previous
violations.  Id.  In assessing civil money penalties for verification, or paperwork, violations, I
generally have followed the line of OCAHO cases that have applied a mathematical, rather than
judgmental, approach to setting the penalty.  See United States v. Carter, 7 OCAHO 931, at 46
(1997), 1997 WL 602725, at *34; United States v. Skydive Academy of Haw. Corp., 6 OCAHO 848,
at  10  (1996),  1996 WL 312123, at *9-10; United States v. Felipe. Inc., 1 OCAHO 626, 629 (Ref.
No. 93), 1989 WL 433965, at *4, aff’d by CAHO, 1 OCAHO 726, 732 (Ref. No. 108) (1989), 1989
WL 433964, at *5 (holding that the mathematical approach is an acceptable, although not exclusive,
approach to setting civil money penalties in paperwork cases).  The mathematical approach works
in the following manner:
[T]he approach [is] to divide $900, the difference between the statutory $1,000
maximum and statutory $100 minimum, by five for the five statutory criteria
[established in 8 U.S.C. § 1324a(e)(5)], arriving at a general amount of $180 for each
penalty factor.  The $180 per factor is not rigidly applied, because certain penalty
factors may justify a greater penalty amount than others.  
Carter, 7 OCAHO 931, at 47, 1997 WL 602725, at *34.  
With respect to Count II, Complainant seeks a civil money penalty of $4,400, or $880 for
each of the five violations contained therein.  See Amended Compl. at 3.  For Count III, Complainant
seeks a penalty of $18,780, which  breaks down into a penalty of $660 for each of the three
violations contained in Amended Complaint paragraphs III.A.4, 9, and 19, and $840 for each of the
twenty remaining violations in the count.  See id. at 5.  Complainant requests a civil money penalty
of $820 for the one violation contained in Count IV, see id., and a civil money penalty of $630 for
the one violation contained in Count V, see id. at 6.  
Complainant has demonstrated a history of prior violations, see C. Request Admiss. Exs. C,
D, so aggravation of the civil money penalty is warranted based on that factor.  Respondents have
admitted that certain individuals were, at the time of hire, illegal aliens unauthorized to work in the
United States, see C. Request Admiss. Sec. V, so Complainant has met its burden of showing that
8 OCAHO 1003
22
penalty enhancement factor for certain parts of the Complaint.20  Complainant,  however, does not
address in its Motion for Summary Decision what other factors it alleges warrant enhancement of
the civil money penalty.  Complainant requests a higher penalty for each paragraph of Counts II-V
than is warranted by the penalty factors Complainant has shown.  Therefore, Complainant has not
met its burden of showing that the full requested civil money penalty for those counts is justified.
Complainant has not demonstrated that it is entitled to the full civil money penalty requested
in the Amended Complaint, with respect either to the substantive or to the verification violations.
Complainant’s Motion for Summary Decision is DENIED as to penalty.  
D.
Complainant’s Motion to Compel Response to Request for Production of Documents
and Answer to Interrogatories
Complainant served its Motion to Compel Response to Request for Production of Documents
and Answer to Interrogatories on April 22, 1998.  Complainant asserted that it served Respondents
with interrogatories and requests for document production on March 13, 1998, and that Respondents
had failed to respond to those discovery requests as of April 21.  C. Mot. Compel ¶¶ 1-3.  Responses
to those discovery requests were due April 17, 1998.  Although Respondents did not answer the
interrogatories and request for production of documents on time, they did provide responses attached
to their Response to the SCO, which was served May 20, 1998.  
Complainant’s Motion to Compel is DENIED as moot because Respondents now have
responded to Complainant’s interrogatories and request for production of documents.  Nothing in
the answers to the interrogatories and request for production of documents will be taken to contradict
matters established as a result of the deemed admissions.  See 28 C.F.R. § 68.21 (1997) (“Any matter
20  Specifically, Respondents have admitted that all five of the individuals listed in
Count II were unauthorized aliens, and that the individuals listed in Count III paragraphs A.5, 
7, 8, 10, 18, and 20 were unauthorized aliens.  Therefore, aggravation of the civil money
penalty is warranted for those particular paragraphs in Counts II and III based on the presence
of unauthorized aliens factor.  Those paragraphs, however, are not the only ones for which
Complainant seeks a penalty enhanced more than in other paragraphs.  Respondents have
admitted that twenty-nine named individuals were taken into INS custody and transported from
Spring & Soon’s place of business as a result of the INS inspection, see C. Request Admiss.
Sec. I, ¶ 7, but that admission alone does not necessarily mean that all twenty-nine of those
people were unauthorized aliens.  Also, Complainant has attached documents entitled “Order to
Show Cause and Notice of Hearing” to some of the I-9 forms that it includes as Exhibit A to its
Request for Admissions, but Complainant only asked Respondents to admit that the attached
I-9 forms are genuine and relate to the named individuals, see C. Request Admiss. Sec. II;
Complainant did not ask Respondents to admit that the documents accompanying the I-9 forms
and also included in Exhibit A are accurate and genuine copies.  
8 OCAHO 1003

admitted under this section is conclusively established unless the Administrative Law Judge upon
motion permits withdrawal or amendment of the admission.”) (emphasis added); see also Fed. R.
Civ. P. 36(b) (“Any matter admitted under this rule is conclusively established unless the court on
motion permits withdrawal or amendment of the admission.”) (emphasis added).  Even though all
liability issues are established in Complainant’s favor, some of the responses to the interrogatories
and document production requests still may be useful for the penalty issue.  If Complainant believes
that any responses to the interrogatories and requests for production of documents are incomplete
or nonresponsive, it retains the right to file a motion to compel. 
E.
Complainant’s Motion to Substitute Counsel
Complainant filed a motion to substitute counsel, along with a notice of appearance for INS
Assistant District Counsel Paul Szeto, on May 27, 1998.  Complainant stated that INS District
Attorney Mimi Tsankov, who had been handling the case, no longer worked for the INS.  Subst.
Mot. at 1.  I noted in my May 29 Order Staying Proceeding that Respondents were entitled to file a
response to the substitution motion on or before June 11, 1998.  To date, Respondents have not filed
such a response.  Because Complainant’s request is reasonable, and because Respondents have
offered no objection, Complainant’s Motion to substitute counsel is GRANTED.  All further
documents in this case will be served on Mr. Szeto as listed in the attached certificate of service. 
V.
CONCLUSION
Respondents have admitted all the matters contained in Complainant’s Request for
Admissions by virtue of the fact that they failed to respond to the Request in a timely manner.  For
the reasons stated previously in this Order, I will not permit Respondents to withdraw and to amend
those admissions.  Complainant’s Motion for Summary Decision is GRANTED with respect to
liability as to both Respondents, but DENIED with respect to penalty.  Complainant’s Motion to
Compel is DENIED as moot.  Complainant’s motion to substitute counsel is GRANTED.
The only remaining issues in this case are the penalties to be assessed.  No later than July 20,
1998, the parties shall file21 either a joint or separate pleadings proposing procedural dates for the
remainder of this case.  Specifically, the parties shall state whether, as to remaining penalty issues,
they waive an evidentiary hearing on penalty and wish to submit documentary evidence and briefs.
If a party wishes to present oral testimony on penalty, then, not later than July 20, 1998, it shall file
a witness list.  The witness list shall state the name, address (including city and state), title (if
applicable) and business telephone number of each witness; shall describe the subject matter of the
testimony and the specific issues on which the witness will testify; shall state the exhibits, if any, that
shall be offered through each witness; and shall state for each witness the approximate amount 
21  “File” means that the document must be received in my office by the given date, not
that it merely must be postmarked by then.  See 28 C.F.R. § 68.8(b) (1997).  
8 OCAHO 1003
24
of  time needed for the direct examination of the witness.  Any modifications to the witness list shall
not be made later than thirty days before the start of hearing unless good cause is shown and specific
permission to do so is granted by the judge.
If a party seeks an evidentiary hearing, it also shall state approximately how much time it
believes would be needed for the hearing, and it shall propose several dates for the hearing.  If a
hearing takes place, it will be conducted where the parties are located, in the New York area.  If a
party prefers to submit the penalty issue on briefs, it shall propose a briefing schedule.  The stay of
proceeding, entered by Order of May 29, 1998, hereby is lifted.
