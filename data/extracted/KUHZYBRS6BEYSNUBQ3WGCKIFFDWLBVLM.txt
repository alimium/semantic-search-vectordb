Dear Tribal Leader: 
 
We are pleased to announce the release of the congressionally-mandated Long Term Plan 
to Build and Enhance Tribal Justice Systems (Tribal Justice Plan), which responds to sections 
211, 241, and 244 of the Tribal Law and Order Act.  The U.S. Departments of Justice (DOJ) and 
Interior (DOI) were asked by Congress to develop long-term plans to address incarceration in 
Indian Country and alternatives to incarceration.  We have further enhanced the plan to include 
offender reentry.  We appreciate and thank all those who commented on and helped to finalize 
the Tribal Justice Plan.  
 
The Tribal Justice Plan is attached and may be accessed at the following web sites: 
• Bureau of Justice Assistance’s Tribal Law and Order Act: Implementation  
 
• National Congress of American Indians’ Tribal Law and Order Resource Center 
Following our public outreach to Indian Country on the draft Tribal Justice Plan, Indian 
tribes, advocates, and contractors submitted 40 comments, sharing their concerns and 
recommendations.  Each of these comments was discussed by DOJ and DOI staff, and most 
recommendations were included in the final Tribal Justice Plan.  
DOJ and DOI will continue to work on the implementation of the Tribal Justice Plan with 
tribal leadership, tribal justice practitioners, and community residents.  More information on 
implementation meetings with federal and tribal representatives will be released later this 
summer.  For updates, please visit the Tribal Law and Order Act: Implementation page at

Sincerely,  
 
A. Elizabeth Griffith
