Joint	  Hurricane	  Testbed	  is	  funded	  by	  the	  US	  Weather	  Research	  Program	  in	  
NOAA/OAR's	  Oﬃce	  of	  Weather	  and	  Air	  Quality.	  	  
Joint Hurricane Testbed (JHT) since 2001 
  Bridge hurricane research and operations 
  Began in 2001 under the USWRP 
  Mission: successfully transfer new technology, research 
results and observational advances from research groups 
to operational centers 
  Testing is done at NHC or EMC 
US Weather Research Program’s vision 
USWRP Goals relating to 
hurricane landfall forecasting 
  To reduce landfall track and intensity forecast errors by 20%.  
  To increase warning lead-time to and beyond 24 hours with 
95% confidence without increasing the present 3-to -1 over 
warning.  
  To make skillful (compared to persistence) forecasts of gale- 
and hurricane-force radii out to 48 hours with 95% 
confidence.  
  To extend quantitative precipitation forecasts out to 3 days 
and enhance skill of day-3 predictions to improve inland 
flooding forecasts.  
Major Activities 2001-2011 
Building the JHT 2001-02 
  Funded initial round of 10 projects for a first year (FY01)  (Mar - Sep 
2001)

JHT: The Process 
• 
Call for Proposals – drafted and disseminated (bi-annually) 
• 
Principal Investigators apply for funding through NOAA 
• 
7 member Steering Committee rates all proposals 
• 
Funded projects are tested during 1 or 2 hurricane seasons in 
conjunction with NHC/EMC points of contact 
• 
At the project’s end, each are evaluated by NHC/EMC staff 
• 
Implementation of successful projects are then carried out 
by NHC/EMC staff/PIs
