Policy Statement—New Energy 
Information Administration Policy for 
the Unscheduled Release of Revisions 
to the Weekly Natural Gas Storage 
Report
AGENCY: Energy Information 
Administration (EIA), Department of 
Energy (DOE).
FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: The 
WNGSR is available on EIA’s Internet 
site at http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/oog/info/
ngs/ngs.html. The survey Form EIA–912 
and instructions used to collect 
information for the WNGSR are

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
ACTION: Policy statement; new Energy 
Information Administration policy for 
the unscheduled release of revisions to 
the Weekly Natural Gas Storage Report. 
I. Background 
II. Discussion of Comments 
III. Current Actions
the EIA Web site at http://
tonto.eia.doe.gov/oog/info/ngs/
schedule.html. 
The EIA provides the public and other 
Federal agencies with opportunities to 
comment on collections of energy 
information conducted by EIA. As 
appropriate, EIA also requests 
comments on important issues relevant 
to EIA’s dissemination of energy 
information. Comments received help 
the EIA when preparing information 
collections and information products 
necessary to EIA’s mission. 
On January 7, 2005, EIA issued a 
Federal Register notice (70 FR 1426–28) 
requesting public comments on 
proposed changes to the current policy 
for handling revisions to information 
disseminated in the WNGSR. In that 
notice, EIA discussed the reasons for 
WNGSR revisions as well as three 
potential proposed policy options for 
the unscheduled release of revisions: (1) 
The existing policy of No Unscheduled 
Release, in which the revised 
information is disseminated in the next 
scheduled WNGSR; (2) Fixed Timing, in 
which revisions of sufficient magnitude 
are released at a fixed time and day 
prior to the next regularly scheduled 
release of the WNGSR; and (3) Variable 
Timing, in which revisions of sufficient 
magnitude may be disseminated 2 hours 
after EIA issues notification.
SUMMARY: The EIA has a new policy 
regarding the unscheduled release of 
revisions to weekly estimates of working 
gas volumes held in underground 
storage facilities at the national and 
regional levels disseminated in EIA’s 
Weekly Natural Gas Storage Report 
(WNGSR). Under the new policy, the 
unscheduled release of revisions shall 
be disseminated in a special release of 
the WNGSR when the effect of reported 
changes is at least 10 billion cubic feet 
(Bcf) at either a regional or national 
level. The unscheduled release of 
revisions shall be disseminated on a 
Federal workday between 2 and 2:10 
p.m. (Eastern Time) following public 
notification between 1 and 1:10 p.m. of 
the same day. Public notification will 
include, at a minimum, the following: A 
notice on EIA’s Web site, e-mails to 
selected media, and a general e-mail 
notice sent to users of WNGSR data who 
have signed onto a free service available 
on EIA’s Web site. The unscheduled 
release of revisions for this policy does 
not include revised estimates resulting 
from changes in the survey methodology 
or estimation parameters, which are 
scheduled and announced in advance; 
or revised estimates resulting from 
reclassifications of natural gas between 
working gas and base gas by natural gas 
storage companies, which are 
incorporated into the estimates during 
the next regularly scheduled WNGSR 
release.
DATES: This policy becomes effective 
with the WNGSR released on May 19, 
2005, containing data as of May 13, 
2005.
II. Discussion of Comments 
In response to the Federal Register 
notice requesting comments on the 
proposed WNGSR revision policy, EIA 
received 26 sets of comments. Most of 
the comments were from energy firms 
and trade groups. 
The comments tended to focus on the 
following general issues for which EIA 
specifically requested a response: 
• Whether EIA should release 
revisions to the Weekly Natural Gas 
Storage Report outside the regular 
established weekly schedule, and if so, 
whether that should occur on a fixed or 
variable schedule. 
• The magnitude of the threshold that 
may trigger an unscheduled release of 
revisions. 
• The timing and pre-notification 
guidelines for the unscheduled release 
of revisions, including the length of 
time between notification and 
subsequent data release. 
• If prior notification is used, whether 
a notification approach using a posting 
on the EIA Web site and e-mail is 
sufficient. 
• Whether the hours for an 
unscheduled release should be limited 
to Federal work hours or the operating 
hours of selected energy trading 
markets. 
I. Background 
The Federal Energy Administration 
Act of 1974 (Pub. L. 93–275, 15 U.S.C. 
761 et seq.) and the DOE Organization 
Act (Pub. L. 95–91, 42 U.S.C. 7101 et 
seq.) require the EIA to carry out a 
centralized, comprehensive, and unified 
energy information program. This 
program collects, evaluates, assembles, 
analyzes, and disseminates information 
on energy resource reserves, production, 
demand, technology, and related 
economic and statistical information. 
This information is used to assess the 
adequacy of energy resources to meet 
near and longer term domestic 
demands. 
The Weekly Natural Gas Storage 
Report (WNGSR) has been issued by EIA 
since May 9, 2002, providing weekly 
estimates of working gas volumes held 
in underground storage facilities at the 
national and regional levels. WNGSR 
users include policymakers, commodity 
market analysts, and industry experts. 
EIA uses the data to prepare analytical 
products assessing storage operations 
and the impact on supplies available, 
and to analyze relationships between 
demand, heating-degree-days, and 
inventory levels. 
The WNGSR is based on information 
collected on Form EIA–912, ‘‘Weekly 
Underground Natural Gas Storage 
Report.’’ Form EIA–912 respondents 
provide estimates for working gas in 
storage as of 9 a.m. Friday each week. 
The deadline for submitting reports to 
the EIA is 5 p.m. (Eastern Time) the 
following Monday, except when 
Monday is a Federal holiday. In that 
case, the submission deadline is 5 p.m. 
on Tuesday. The WNGSR is released on 
Thursday between 10:30 and 10:40 a.m. 
(Eastern Time) on EIA’s Web site (http:/
/tonto.eia.doe.gov/oog/info/ngs/
ngs.html), except when Thursday is a 
Federal holiday. A listing of changes to 
this general schedule is maintained on

respondent suggesting a press release 
also. 
In reference to the potential hours 
during which the unscheduled release 
of revisions may occur, seven 
respondents indicated that such releases 
should occur anytime, five expressed a 
preference for major energy market 
hours, and three suggested that Federal 
government work hours would be 
appropriate. Eleven respondents did not 
express an opinion on this issue. 
Respondents indicating a preference for 
a broader release horizon argued that 
the information should be made 
available as soon as possible. However, 
it was not clear whether these 
respondents literally meant anytime or 
implicitly preferred Federal work hours. 
Those preferring unscheduled releases 
during the business hours of the major 
energy markets indicated that a release 
during that period would be more 
equitable for all market participants. 
managing the uncertainty and 
disruption that may be associated with 
on-going updates. 
EIA is establishing a policy with a 
time for the unscheduled release of 
revisions between 2 and 2:10 p.m. on a 
Federal workday in order to reduce 
uncertainty in the market and the cost 
of monitoring EIA’s Internet site 
continually for revision announcements. 
Further, the only time that EIA will 
issue a notification of an upcoming 
release of revisions will be between 1 
p.m. and 1:10 p.m. during a Federal 
workday. 
An approximate 1 hour delay between 
notification and release of a revision 
will provide market participants 
adequate opportunity to prepare for the 
new data and will not unduly delay the 
release of the information to the public. 
The announcement of a pending release 
will occur in multiple ways including 
through a Web site announcement, e-
mails to selected media, and a general 
e-mail notice sent to users of WNGSR 
data who have signed onto a free service 
available on EIA’s Web site. Users 
should note that timely delivery of the 
notification through e-mail depends on 
a number of factors, including their 
Internet service providers and Internet 
traffic, and in some cases a notification 
may not be received before the release 
of the revised WNGSR. However, 
reliance on multiple forms of 
communication will work to minimize 
difficulties in informing the public. 
The new policy reflects EIA’s 
concerns regarding its ability to execute 
the unscheduled releases effectively. 
While considering implementation 
plans for a more flexible policy, EIA 
determined that market participants 
with automated Web browser programs 
(also called ‘‘robots’’) may continually 
monitor EIA’s Web site for an 
announcement. The system congestion 
caused by users in short episodes, such 
as occurs each Thursday at 10:30 a.m. 
for the scheduled release of the WNGSR, 
has been noticeable to EIA Web site 
managers, but has not caused significant 
problems to date. If EIA had a policy of 
releasing an unscheduled WNGSR 
revision at any time during the day, 
users might impose a similar load on 
EIA’s system on a continual basis. The 
sustained high level of activity on EIA’s 
Web site could overwhelm the system 
and seriously degrade system 
performance and responsiveness for all 
users. This could prevent EIA from 
successfully executing a release and 
even jeopardize EIA’s overall Internet 
operations. By limiting customer 
interest to brief periods around 1–1:10 
p.m. for notification, and 2–2:10 p.m. 
for release of an unscheduled release, 
EIA’s Response to Comments Received 
The comments on the issue of a policy 
for the unscheduled release of WNGSR 
revisions generally focused on the 
benefit of the public having the most 
accurate data as soon it can be made 
available as well as reducing 
uncertainty for market participants. 
While the benefits of providing the 
unscheduled release of revisions are not 
empirically measurable, commenters 
generally agreed that more flexibility in 
releasing this information will be an 
improvement to EIA’s current policy of 
no unscheduled release of revisions, 
despite the likely resulting costs of 
monitoring EIA for the possibility of an 
unscheduled release.
There are a number of factors that 
were considered in developing a more 
flexible unscheduled release policy. 
First, EIA’s goal is to provide all market 
participants fair opportunity to access 
new information at the same time to 
avoid bestowing an unfair advantage on 
a subset of market participants. The 
unscheduled release of revisions makes 
ensuring fairness to all market 
participants problematic because market 
participants may not learn of a revision 
at the same time. While many 
respondents asserted that a variable 
release policy would reduce market 
uncertainty, the possibility of an 
unscheduled release occurring at any 
time during the day could increase 
market uncertainty more often than not, 
as rumors about revisions may occur 
more frequently than revisions 
themselves. A revision policy in which 
revisions may occur on any Federal 
workday at a specified fixed time 
balances the public’s desire for up-to-
date, accurate information with 
As to whether EIA should conduct the 
unscheduled release of revisions to the 
Weekly Natural Gas Storage Report, two 
respondents indicated that EIA should 
continue the existing policy of issuing 
revisions only on the official schedule, 
while twenty-one indicated a preference 
that revisions be made available prior to 
the next scheduled release, and the 
three remaining respondents did not 
express a preference. The respondents 
who preferred no change in the current 
policy felt that it was adequate. Most of 
the respondents who were in favor of 
changing the current policy to permit 
unscheduled releases outside the 
regular weekly cycle argued that 
providing the market with the revised 
data more promptly would ensure that 
the storage data being used by market 
participants were as accurate and timely 
as possible. 
With regard to the appropriateness of 
the suggested threshold of 15 Bcf to 
trigger an unscheduled release of 
revisions, responses varied 
considerably. Fifteen respondents 
expressed a preference for thresholds 
ranging up to 15 Bcf. Of those fifteen, 
two respondents favored thresholds 
below 7 Bcf, six favored a 7 Bcf 
threshold, one suggested a range of 7 to 
10 Bcf, three favored 10 Bcf, and three 
favored a 15 Bcf threshold. Another 
respondent suggested the threshold 
should be a percentage of current 
working gas stocks, although a 
percentage was not specified. The 
remaining ten respondents did not 
provide an opinion regarding a 
threshold that would trigger an 
unscheduled release. 
On the timing and pre-notification of 
the unscheduled release of revisions, 
three respondents indicated that EIA 
should not provide early notification, 
fourteen indicated that pre-notification 
2 hours in advance was appropriate, one 
respondent suggested an overnight 
delay, and the remaining eight 
respondents did not state a preference. 
Respondents opposed to a delay 
between the pre-notification and the 
unscheduled release of a revision 
expressed a preference to have the 
information as soon as possible. 
Respondents in favor of pre-notification 
asserted that the early notice would give 
market participants time to prepare for 
the new information and help ensure 
that they would receive the information 
simultaneously. With respect to how to 
issue a pre-notification of an impending 
unscheduled release, all twelve 
respondents expressing a preference 
indicated that some combination of an 
e-mail notice and Web site posting 
would be sufficient, with one

(WNGSR), e-mail notification to selected 
media, and an e-mail notice that will be 
sent to all users of WNGSR data who 
have signed onto a free distribution 
service. There are two exceptions to the 
release of revised WNGSR data on an 
unscheduled basis. First, this 
unscheduled release policy will not 
apply to data changes resulting from 
changes in the methodology or 
estimation parameters. Second, revised 
estimates due to respondents 
reclassifying gas (between working gas 
and base gas inventories) will be 
reported only in regularly-scheduled 
releases of the WNGSR. 
EIA reserves the right to revisit or 
amend this policy at any time at the 
discretion of the Administrator. 
However, EIA will provide prior 
notification in the Weekly Natural Gas 
Storage Report or the Federal Register 
before implementing any changes.

event that a significant error in the data 
submitted by respondents or in EIA’s 
processing of that data is discovered 
shortly after it is issued. 
This new policy will not apply to 
scheduled releases such as changes in 
methodology or estimation parameters, 
which are scheduled and announced in 
advance. It also will not apply to revised 
estimates resulting from respondents 
reclassifying gas already in underground 
storage facilities (between working gas 
and base gas inventories). Revisions 
based on reclassifications of gas will 
only be reported in the next regularly-
scheduled release of the WNGSR. The 
timing of a reclassification is often 
discretionary for the respondent. Even 
when it is not (e.g., it becomes final on 
the basis of regulatory agency action), 
the respondent has unique knowledge 
related to a potential revision. In order 
to limit the possible disruption to 
markets caused by the reclassification of 
previous working gas inventories, 
reclassifications will be included in the 
estimate for the next regularly 
scheduled WNGSR release, no matter 
when they are officially accounted for 
by the respondent. Reclassifications 
exceeding a 7 Bcf threshold will be 
noted in the WNGSR text, although as 
adjustments to the current week data, 
they are not actually revisions. As a 
result, reclassifications would not lead 
to mid-week revisions which would be 
known in advance by only one 
respondent. All revisions that continue 
to be disseminated in regularly-
scheduled releases of the WNGSR will 
be handled according to the revision 
policy established in a prior notice 
published in the Federal Register on 
November 12, 2002 (67 FR 68581–
68583). That policy also appears in the 
WNGSR Methodology documentation 
available at http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/oog/
info/ngs/methodology.html#revisions. 
the threat to EIA’s Internet capabilities 
is reduced. 
This approach to timing of the 
announcement of an impending 
unscheduled release of a WNGSR 
revision will allow for revisions to be 
released as early as the same day the 
need for a revision is identified 
including situations in which the need 
for a revision is identified shortly after 
the WNGSR is released. It achieves this 
result in a manner that should not create 
unnecessary costs for users with limited 
resources and helps to avoid potential 
difficulties that might jeopardize the 
operational integrity of EIA’s Internet 
site. 
Lastly, each new announcement that 
EIA makes about the natural gas storage 
data seems to have a significant 
influence on market trading. 
Announcement of a pending 
unscheduled release likely will be 
accompanied by price volatility or a 
virtual suspension of trading, either of 
which constitutes a disruption of 
normal trading. As a result, it seems 
prudent for EIA to adopt a threshold for 
an unscheduled release of a revision 
higher than the current 7 Bcf threshold 
for a regularly scheduled revision to the 
WNGSR. EIA selected a threshold of 10 
Bcf. Using this threshold, EIA would 
have had one unscheduled release of a 
WNGSR revision between January 1, 
2003, and March 31, 2005. 
This new policy will become effective 
with the WNGSR released on May 19, 
2005, containing data as of May 13, 
2005. This date was chosen to ensure 
adequate time for developing and 
testing unscheduled release procedures, 
testing revised report formats, and 
working with WNGSR customers on the 
new formats. A test site for the modified 
report formats (which will be 
redesigned to accommodate revision 
markers) will be provided in early May. 
Information about the test site and 
changes will be provided on the 
WNGSR Web site in the first week of 
May.
SUMMARY: In compliance with the 
Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 
3501 et seq.), this document announces 
that EPA is planning to submit a 
proposed Information Collection 
Request (ICR) to the Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB). This is 
a request for a new collection. Before 
submitting the ICR to OMB for review 
and approval, EPA is soliciting 
comments on specific aspects of the 
proposed information collection as 
described below.
DATES: Comments must be submitted on 
or before June 27, 2005.
III. Current Actions 
EIA is establishing a new policy for 
the unscheduled release of revisions to 
certain information disseminated in the 
WNGSR. In establishing this new 
policy, EIA recognizes the importance of 
timeliness in providing revised storage 
estimates. After considering all factors, 
EIA decided to establish a policy 
allowing for the unscheduled release of 
WNGSR revisions on any Federal 
workday at a set time between 2 and 
2:10 p.m. after public notification 
between 1 and 1:10 p.m. This timetable 
would allow for a same-day correction 
to a morning WNGSR release in the 
EIA WNGSR Policy for Unscheduled 
Release of Revisions 
The unscheduled release of revisions 
to weekly estimates of working gas held 
in underground storage caused by data 
changes or corrections when the 
cumulative effect of these changes is at 
least 10 Bcf shall be disseminated on a 
Federal workday between 2 p.m. and 
2:10 p.m. (Eastern Time) following 
notice of the pending release to the 
public between 1 p.m. and 1:10 p.m. 
(Eastern Time). If a revision is made, 
changes to all affected regions shall be 
recorded in the 2–2:10 p.m. release. 
Public notification will occur in a 
number of ways including a Web site 
notice of the impending release of 
revised data that will replace the current 
Weekly Natural Gas Storage Report
