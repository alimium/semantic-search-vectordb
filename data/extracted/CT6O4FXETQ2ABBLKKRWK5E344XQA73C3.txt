A Good Deal for Seniors �

All Americans are struggling with the ever-increasing costs of health care, but seniors have been especially hard hit. I
have fought for this change in Medicare since I was first elected, so I'm very happy that we were able to pass this bill
today that will help seniors get more affordable health care.�
�
�
Medicare beneficiaries were done a disservice when the Medicare Prescription Drug bill passed with a provision that
prohibited the Secretary of Health and Human Services from negotiating prices with drug manufacturers. Today we fixed
that.�
�
�
Negotiating for better prescription drug prices is a long overdue step toward making health care more affordable for
Medicare beneficiaries. I am proud to have helped pass this bipartisan legislation and I look forward to continuing to work
for better and more affordable health care for our seniors. �
