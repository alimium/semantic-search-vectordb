access to and permission to copy the sealed second supplemental clerk’s transcript, pages 16 
through 224, of his record on appeal, is granted.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 8.328 (c)(6).)  Counsel 
must supply the personnel and equipment necessary to undertake this review and copying of the 
records, which must occur on the premises of the court.  Use of such materials is limited to any 
petition for writ of habeas corpus challenging the lawfulness of confinement pursuant to the 
underlying judgment of death.  To the extent the parties quote or describe such materials in court 
papers, those papers must themselves be filed or lodged under seal.  The materials referred to the

Attorney General’s moving the Solano County Superior Court to unseal the record.  (Cal. Rules of

Geraldine S. Russell is hereby appointed to represent appellant Paul Gregory Watson for habeas

court. 
 
Any “petition for writ of habeas corpus will be presumed to be filed without substantial delay if it 
is filed … within 36 months” of this date (Supreme Ct. Policies Regarding Cases Arising From 
Judgments of Death, policy 3, timeliness std. 1-1.1), and it will be presumed that any successive 
petition filed within that period is justified or excused (see In re Clark (1993) 5 Cal.4th 750, 774-
782), in light of prior habeas corpus/executive clemency counsel Francis Breidenbach’s 
declaration, in support of his motion to withdraw, to the effect that he was unable to discharge his 
duty to investigate and, if appropriate, present a habeas corpus petition on behalf of appellant Paul 
Gregory Watson, and this court’s delay in appointing replacement habeas corpus/executive 
clemency counsel.
