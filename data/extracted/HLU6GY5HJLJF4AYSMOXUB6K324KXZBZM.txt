SECTION 1.0  
INTRODUCTION 
 
Temperature impairments were assessed within Peterson Creek using a combination of in-stream 
temperature measurements, riparian shading assessments, mid-summer streamflow 
measurements, and modeling.  The Peterson Creek temperature assessment was conducted to aid 
in the development of Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs) in the Upper Clark Fork TMDL 
Planning Area (TPA).  Data collected during this assessment were used in the QUAL2K model 
to assess the influence of shading and streamflow on stream temperatures in Peterson Creek.  
The results of this assessment were compared to Montana’s water quality standards for 
temperature to evaluate beneficial use support and potential restoration strategies. 
 
1.1 Montana Water Quality Standards 
 
Montana’s water quality standard for temperature addresses a maximum allowable increase 
above the “naturally occurring” temperature to protect the existing thermal regime for fish and 
aquatic life.  For waters classified as B-1, the maximum allowable increase over the naturally 
occurring temperature (if the naturally occurring temperature is less than 66º Fahrenheit) is 1°F.  
In the naturally occurring range of 66-66.5 ºF, an increase cannot exceed 67ºF.  If the naturally 
occurring temperature is greater than 66.5ºF, the maximum allowable increase is 0.5º F [ARM 
17.30.622(e) and ARM 17.30.623(e)].  Temperature monitoring and modeling indicated that 
naturally occurring stream temperatures in Peterson Creek are likely greater than 66.5°F during 
portions of the summer months.  Thus, the maximum allowable increase due to unmitigated 
human causes is 0.5°F (0.23°C).

SECTION 2.0  
TEMPERATURE ASSESSMENT 
 
The Peterson Creek temperature assessment was performed in order to identify existing 
conditions and to determine if anthropogenic disturbances have led to increased stream water 
temperatures.  This assessment utilized field data and computer modeling to assess stream 
temperatures in relation to Montana’s water quality standards. 
 
2.1 Field Data collection 
 
Field data used in this assessment were collected by Montana DEQ staff during the 2007 field 
season and included temperature measurements, streamflow measurements, and an assessment of 
riparian shading along Peterson Creek and selected tributaries.  Field methods are described in 
Upper Clark Fork TMDL Planning Area Temperature and Instantaneous Flow Monitoring 
Sampling and Analysis Plan (MDEQ 2007). 
 
2.1.1 Temperature Measurements 
 
Temperature monitoring was conducted on Peterson Creek over a two-month timeframe in the 
summer of 2007.  The study timeframe examined stream temperatures during the period when 
streamflows tend to be lowest, water temperatures are warmest, and negative affects to the cold 
water fishery and aquatic life beneficial uses are likely most pronounced.  Temperature 
monitoring consisted of placing temperature data logging devices at 11 sites in the Peterson 
Creek watershed during the summer of 2007.  Temperature monitoring sites were selected to 
bracket stream reaches with similar hydrology, riparian vegetation type, valley type, stream 
aspect, and channel width so that the temperature data collected during this assessment could be 
utilized in the QUAL2K model.  A summary of temperature data is presented in Attachment A. 
 
2.1.2 Streamflow Measurements 
 
Streamflow was measured at 11 sites on Peterson Creek and selected tributary streams where 
temperature data logging devices were deployed.  Streamflow data were collected during 
temperature data logger deployment and again during retrieval.  Streamflow data collected 
during this assessment were used in the QUAL2K model to help determine if in-stream 
temperatures exceed Montana standards.  Streamflow data is presented in Attachment B. 
 
2.1.3 Riparian Shading 
 
Riparian shading was assessed at five sites along Peterson Creek using a Solar Pathfinder which 
measures the amount of shade at a site in one-hour intervals.  The Solar Pathfinder was utilized 
to assess riparian shading using the August template for the path of the sun.  Shade was 
measured three times over a 200-foot reach at each site.  In addition to the Solar Pathfinder 
readings, the following measurements were performed at each site in which riparian shading was 
assessed: 
• Stream azimuth

for Water Quality Restoration – Appendix G 
 
• Bankfull width 
• Wetted width 
• Dominant tree species 
 
Riparian shading data were used to assess existing and potential riparian shading conditions 
relative to the level of anthropogenic disturbance at a site.  Measurements obtained with the 
Solar Pathfinder were utilized in the QUAL2K model to help determine if in-stream 
temperatures exceed Montana standards.  Solar Pathfinder data are presented in Attachment C. 
 
2.2 QUAL2K Model 
 
The QUAL2K model was used to determine if human caused disturbances within the watershed 
have increased the water temperature above the “naturally occurring” level and, if so, to what 
degree.  The QUAL2K model is available at: 
http://www.epa.gov/ATHENS/wwqtsc/html/qual2k.html.  Stream temperature, riparian shading 
and streamflow data collected in the summer of 2007 were used to calibrate the QUAL2K model 
for existing conditions.  The potential to reduce stream temperatures was then modeled based on 
five scenarios, including: 
• Baseline scenario (existing conditions) 
• Increased shade scenario 
• Decreased water consumptive use scenario 
• Natural condition scenario (no anthropogenic impacts)  
• Naturally occurring scenario (full application of BMPs to present uses) 
 
2.2.1 Data Sources and Model Assumptions 
 
Data sources and model assumptions made during this assessment include: 
 
1. Temperature data loggers were placed at 11 sites in the Peterson Creek watershed during 
the summer of 2007, including eight mainstem locations and three tributaries.  Data 
loggers were deployed between July 16th and 18th and retrieved on September 26th.  One 
mainstem temperature data logger was lost (PTR-04) and one tributary data logger did 
not work properly (PTR-02) resulting in temperature data for seven Peterson Creek sites 
and two tributary streams (Table 2-1).  The maximum daily temperature and the 7-day 
average maximum temperature data were reviewed to identify the warmest day of the 
season.  Maximum daily temperatures occurred between July 19th and 28th, depending on 
the site, while the 7-day average maximum temperature occurred between July 20th and 
22nd (Attachment A).  Based on this data set, the QUAL2K model was run for July 21st, 
2007 conditions.  
 
2. Streamflow data were collected at 11 sites during temperature data logger deployment 
and retrieval, with eight measurements on Peterson Creek and three measurements on 
tributary streams (Table 2-1, Attachment B).  Streamflows collected during data logger 
deployment were applied in the QUAL2K model since the deployment date (July 16th – 
18th) was near the date for which maximum temperatures were modeled (July 21st).

Depth and velocity measurements at each streamflow measurement site were used to 
develop a rating curve for use in the QUAL2K model.  The upper site (PTR-01) was 
excluded when developing the rating curve for depth since this flow measurement was 
much lower than all the other measurements.

3. Streamside shading was assessed at five sites corresponding to the location of 
temperature data loggers.  Four sites were located on Peterson Creek, while one site was 
located on a headwater tributary stream.  Riparian shade was assessed using the August 
template for the solar pathfinder, which measures the amount of shade at one-hour 
intervals.  Since the QUAL2K model was run for July 21st, shade measurements based on 
the August path of the sun may be slightly higher than the actual shade on July 21st due to 
the fact that sun is slightly lower in the sky during August than during July.  However, 
based on the relatively small size of the riparian shade dataset, any additional error 
introduced based on slightly different sun angles in July and August is likely negligible. 
At each site where shade was assessed, the riparian vegetation type was also described 
and the average daily shade at each site was calculated (Table 2-2).  Average daily shade 
ranged from 34% at PTR-08 to 92% at PTR-07.  The majority of the solar pathfinder 
measurements documented relatively dense shrub cover which was observed along much 
of Peterson Creek and measured at sites PTR-03, PTR-04 and PTR-07.  Forested 
conditions in the headwaters were documented at the PTR-02 site, while open pasture 
conditions in areas of irrigated agriculture were documented at the PTR-08 site.

4. Following field data collection, a GIS project was initiated to evaluate riparian conditions 
along Peterson Creek using National Agricultural Imagery Program (NAIP) color aerial 
imagery from 2005, along with high-resolution color orthophotographs from May 20th, 
2004 collected in the vicinity of Deer Lodge.  Information prepared during Montana 
DEQ’s recent Upper Clark Fork TPA Aerial Assessment Reach Stratification project was 
also reviewed.  For this project, the 1:24,000 USGS NHD layer was used for Peterson 
Creek, while the 1:100,000 NHD layer was used to identify tributary streams.  A total of 
10 reaches were delineated along Peterson Creek based on changes in vegetation type, 
changes in stream aspect, and tributary inputs.  These 10 reaches were used to break 
Peterson Creek into 10 stream segments in the QUAL2K model.  QUAL2K model 
segments were identified as “PCT” in this report, which indicates “Peterson Creek 
Temperature” reaches (Table 2-3, Figure 2-1).   
 
Table 2-3. Peterson Creek Temperature (PCT) Reach Descriptions. 
Reach 
Description 
Mainstem 
headwater 
The Mainstem Headwater Reach extended from the headwaters downstream to the confluence with 
Tributary 1.  The data logger PTR-01 was located at the break between the Mainstem Headwater 
Reach and Reach PCT1.  Vegetation included conifers in the overstory with shrubs in the understory. 
PCT1 
Reach PCT1 extended from Tributary 1 downstream to a road crossing that is associated with a slight 
aspect change as well as a change in riparian vegetation.  Water from Tributary 1 was added to this 
reach at the same temperature as recorded at PTR-01.  Tributary 1 is apparently larger than Peterson 
Creek at the confluence. Vegetation included conifers in the overstory with shrubs in the understory. 
PCT2 
Reach PCT2 extends from the road crossing downstream past data logger PTR-03 to a change in 
vegetation.  Tributary 2 and Tributary 3 enter this reach upstream of the PTR-03 data logger.  
Temperatures were elevated at the PTR-03 data logger, so the two tributary streams were added in at 
the same temperature that was recorded in Jack Creek (PTR-05).  There was an irrigation withdrawal 
that appeared to be downstream of the PTR-03 logger.  Vegetation included shrubs in the valley 
bottom and conifers on the hillslopes.  Beaver ponds were observed during the 2007 field assessment. 
PCT3 
Reach PCT3 extended from a vegetation break to an aspect break.  There are no data loggers and no 
tributary inputs.  Vegetation included sparse deciduous trees and shrubs in the valley bottom and 
conifers on the hillslopes.

Reach 
Description 
PCT4 
Reach PCT4 extended down to the confluence with Jack Creek.  A small input of groundwater was 
added to this reach.  Vegetation includes deciduous trees and shrubs in the valley bottom and conifers 
on the hillslopes.  This reach marked the lowest extend of coniferous vegetation. 
PCT5 
Reach PCT5 extended from the confluence with Jack Creek downstream to the upstream end of the 
hayfield and the start of irrigated agriculture.  This reach included data logger PTR-07.  Jack Creek 
was smaller than Peterson Creek at their confluence.  Temperature data (PTR-05) and flow data from 
Jack Creek were applied to the model.  Flows in this reach decreased due to irrigation withdrawals as 
documented by streamflow measurements at data logger PTR-07.  Streamflows then increase again 
by the lower end of the reach (PTR-08) likely due to irrigation return flows.  Irrigation return flows 
were modeled at the same temperature as measured in Jack Creek (PTR-05).  Vegetation included 
shrubs in the valley bottom.   
PCT6 
Reach PCT6 included the irrigated hayfield through which this entire reach flows.  Data logger PTR-
09 was located in this reach along with the PTR-08 shade assessment site.  No irrigation withdrawals 
were identified in this reach due to a lack of streamflow data.  An assessment of aerial imagery 
indicated there were irrigation withdrawals within this reach.  Vegetation included open pasture and 
irrigated agriculture.   
PCT7 
Reach PCT7 began at the confluence with Burnt Hollow Creek which was smaller than Peterson 
Creek.  Reach PCT7 flows through an area of irrigated agriculture and includes PTR-12.  
Streamflows increased slightly at the upper end of the reach as documented at PTR-12 and this was 
attributed to downstream irrigation return flows.  Progressing through the reach, streamflow then 
decreased likely due to irrigation withdrawals.  The measured temperatures at PTR-12 were the 
highest of the study area. Vegetation included shrubs alternating with open pasture areas and sparse 
deciduous trees.  Beaver dams were apparent in the 2004 aerial imagery.   
PCT8 
Reach PCT8 extended downstream from the I-90 crossing to where the channel became channelized 
along the east side of Deer Lodge.  No losses or gains in streamflow were identified within this reach.  
Vegetation included shrubs and sparse deciduous trees.   
PCT9 
Reach PCT 9 was channelized along the east side of Deer Lodge.  Vegetation included shrubs and 
sparse deciduous trees alternative with open pasture areas.

5. Solar pathfinder data collected at five sites in the Peterson Creek watershed were used to 
assign shading values to assessed reaches in the QUAL2K model.  Reaches in which the 
solar pathfinder data were applied directly included PCT2, PCT4 and PCT6 based on 
solar pathfinder sites PTR-03, PTR-04 and PTR-08, respectively.  For reaches in which 
no solar pathfinder data were collected, shade values were extrapolated from assessed 
reaches based on similar riparian vegetation characteristics as observed in GIS using 
color aerial imagery from 2004 and 2005 (Table 2-4).  In addition, reaches PCT5, PCT7 
and PCT8 were assigned hourly shade values based on the average of shade 
measurements at sites PTR-07 and PTR-08 since the aerial assessment indicated that 
these reaches alternated between dense riparian vegetation and open areas.  Combining 
data from sites PTR-07 and PTR-08 resulted in a reach average shade value of 63% 
(Attachment C).

6. Climatic data inputs for the QUAL2K model were obtained from the Pacific Northwest 
Cooperative Agricultural Weather Network (AgriMet) site in Deer Lodge, Montana 
(http://www.usbr.gov/pn/agrimet/webaghrread.html) and included air temperature, dew 
point temperature and wind speed.  Wind speed was reduced to 0 m/s under the 
assumption that this small stream is relatively sheltered from the wind.  The dew point 
temperature was adjusted by increasing the relative humidity by 15% based on local 
conditions within the stream corridor as measured in a similar assessment in the Big Hole 
River watershed (Flynn et. al. 2008).  Cloud cover was assumed to be 0% in the 
QUAL2K model.   
 
7. To evaluate tributary and groundwater inputs and water withdrawals along Peterson 
Creek, a hydrologic balance was created (Table 2-5).  Flows were balanced at the outlet 
of each reach and at each data logger site where flows were measured.  Where tributaries 
were present in a reach, increases in streamflow were entirely attributed to the tributary 
inflows.  When no tributaries were present, inputs were attributed to groundwater 
discharge in the upper watershed and to irrigation return flows in the lower watershed.  
Groundwater inputs were assigned a temperature of 11.0°C based on the results of a 
similar modeling effort in the Big Hole River watershed, which shares a hydrologic 
boundary with the Upper Clark Fork River watershed in which Peterson Creek is located

(Flynn et. al. 2008).  Streamflow decreases were considered due to irrigation 
withdrawals, which are evident in the aerial imagery.  Inflows were treated as follows: 
• Trib 1 enters at the same temperature as PTR-1 (Peterson mainstem headwater) 
• Tribs 2 and 3 enter at the same temperature as PTR-05 (Jack Creek) 
• Trib 4 enters at the same temperature as PTR-11 (Burnt Hollow Creek) 
• Inflows in Reaches 6 and 8 enter at the same temperature as PTR-11

2.2.2 Baseline Scenario 
 
Once the above calibration steps were performed, the QUAL2K model was run for the baseline 
scenario which is intended to represent existing conditions in Peterson Creek on July 21st, 2007 
(Figure 2-2).  This model run utilized all measured field data, with the assumptions described in 
Section 2.2.1 of this document.  The model failed to accurately predict the dramatic increase in 
temperatures that were actually measured between sites PTR-01 and PTR-03 at the upper end of 
Peterson Creek.  Poor model calibration between sites PTR-01 and PTR-03 was thought to be 
primarily due to the small size of this stream relative to the influence of riparian shading.  
Hydraulic output in the model accurately reflected measured conditions, indicating that water 
routing and channel morphology were adequately calibrated.  Several additional model 
calibration steps were taken in an attempt to increase temperatures between site PTR-01 and 
PTR-03.  Decreasing shade to 0% was required to accomplish this task.  Since this appeared 
unrealistic based on a review of aerial imagery and on-the-ground observations, the decision was 
made to retain the baseline scenario as depicted in Figure 2-2 with the understanding that it does 
not accurately represent temperature values measured in the field, especially in the upper reaches 
of Peterson Creek.  Model scenarios were compared to the results of the baseline model and not 
to the field measured values to assure consistency when evaluating the potential to reduce stream 
temperatures.

The baseline scenario model run indicated that stream temperatures remained relatively cool 
downstream to the confluence with Jack Creek and the PTR-07 data logger.  In contrast, actual 
temperature measurements in 2007 indicated water temperature increases near the PTR-03 data 
logger followed by relatively constant temperatures progressing downstream all the way to the 
mouth.  Modeled stream temperatures increased between Jack Creek and Burnt Hollow Creek,

followed by downstream temperatures decreases.  The maximum measured temperature was 
recorded at the PTR-12 data logger, which was located downstream of the confluence with Burnt 
Hollow Creek.  Both the modeled and measured temperatures decreased as Peterson Creek 
approached the I-90 crossing.  This may have been due to what appeared to be a large beaver 
complex within reach PCT7.  Downstream of the I-90 crossing, both modeled and measured 
temperatures again increased.  Thus, the results of the baseline modeling effort and 2007 field 
temperature measurements indicated that Peterson Creek from the Jack Creek confluence and 
continuing downstream past Burnt Hollow Creek, and Peterson Creek downstream of the I-90 
crossing, may be negatively influenced by elevated water temperatures. 
 
2.2.3 Shade Scenario 
 
In the shade modeling scenario, areas with presently diminished shade conditions were changed 
to an unperturbed reference condition based on field measured shade values.  Reaches of 
Peterson Creek extending from the headwaters to Jack Creek (through reach PCT4) were 
considered to be at their potential shade levels, with reach average shade values of 71-87%.  
Reaches of Peterson Creek from the confluence with Jack Creek downstream to the mouth, 
Reaches PCT5 through PCT9, were assigned an estimated reference shade value of 86% based 
on the average of the hourly measurements at sites PTR-03, PTR-04 and PTR-07 (Attachment 
C).  Since no actual measurements were made for reference conditions where dense riparian 
vegetation covered the channel, the 85% value was applied as an estimate of reference 
conditions.  If additional data become available for reference conditions, the 85% value may be 
adjusted accordingly.  All other parameters from the baseline scenario were retained.  The results 
of shade scenario 1 indicated a dramatic decrease in maximum temperatures, particularly in 
reaches PCT6 and PCT9 which were generally lacking woody shrub cover (Figure 2-3).  The 
dramatic modeled temperature reductions were likely influenced by the minimal flow and 
associated small buffering capacity of this small stream.

To further evaluate the influence of shade, a second scenario was assessed in which the estimated 
reference value derived from the average hourly measurements at sites PTR-03, PTR-04 and 
PTR-07 were applied only to reaches PCT6 and PCT9.  These two reaches had extensive areas of 
open pasture and minimal riparian shrub cover as observed on aerial imagery from 2004 and 
2005.  All other parameters from the baseline scenario were retained, including shade values 
along PCT7 since aerial imagery indicated there was a relatively dense band of riparian 
vegetation along much of this reach.  In addition, a more detailed assessment of riparian 
vegetation along one 500-foot reach within reach PCT7 in 2007 found that riparian shrub cover 
along the channel margin averaged 53% and ranged from 35% to 65%.  The second shade 
scenario also led to a substantial decrease in maximum temperatures (Figure 2-4).  This scenario 
was determined to best represent the potential to decrease stream temperatures by increasing 
shade along selected reaches of Peterson Creek.

2.2.4 Channel Morphology Scenario 
 
When applying the QUAL2K model in temperature assessments, a channel morphology scenario 
that examines the influence of channel over-widening is often applied.  However, field data 
collected in 2007 documented low width/depth ratios, suggesting there was minimal potential to 
further reduce stream channel width.  Thus, the channel morphology modeling scenario was not 
applied to the Peterson Creek temperature assessment. 
 
2.2.5 Water Consumptive Use Scenario 
 
The water consumptive use scenario describes the thermal effect of irrigation and domestic water 
uses on water temperatures in Peterson Creek.  This scenario was modeled by removing existing 
water diversions from the study reach as identified in the hydrologic balance (Table 2-5).  The 
current modeling effort included irrigation withdrawals identified in three reaches: PCT5, PCT7 
and PCT9.  Warm water irrigation return flows were also removed from reaches PCT5 and 
PCT7.  Additional irrigation withdrawals not identified through field measurements in 2007 may 
be present, but were not accounted for in this modeling exercise.  These included observed 
withdrawals in reaches PCT2 and PCT6.  All other parameters from the baseline scenario were 
retained.  This scenario indicated that water withdrawals have a lesser potential impact on stream 
temperatures than riparian shading (Figure 2-5).  The model indicated that slight decreases in 
temperature could be achieved through water conservation in reach PCT6 upstream of the 
confluence with Burnt Hollow Creek and reach PCT9 through the City of Deer Lodge.  Due to a 
lack of measurements of irrigation withdrawals throughout the system, the results of the water 
consumptive use scenario should be interpreted with caution.  If more detailed flow data for the 
irrigation network becomes available, this scenario may need to be reevaluated.

Note that streamflow measurements in July of 2007 document a maximum flow in Peterson 
Creek of 2.1 cfs at site PTR-12, with flows then decreasing to 0.4 cfs by the mouth (site PTR-
14), which is a distance of approximately 2.6 miles.  This section of Peterson Creek may be an 
appropriate area on which to focus water management activities since flows were observed to 
decrease by 80% in this reach, which extends from downstream of the confluence with Burnt 
Hollow Creek to the mouth. 
 
2.2.6 Natural Condition Scenario 
 
The natural condition scenario reflects the temperature regime that would be expected absent of 
the influence of man.  This allows for the characterization of the extent of the departure from the 
natural condition.  Factors applied in shade scenario 1 (reference shade) and the water 
consumptive use scenario (no irrigation withdrawals) were applied to run this scenario.  All other 
parameters from the baseline scenario were retained.  The natural condition scenario indicated 
that maximum temperatures at the mouth of Peterson Creek could be approximately 15°F cooler 
than the modeled maximum temperature of 78.3°F (Figure 2-6).  The measured maximum 
temperature on July 21st of 2007 was 75.8°F at the mouth (PTR-14), while the natural condition 
scenario results in a maximum temperature of 62.7°F (Attachment D), suggesting water 
temperatures could be approximately 13°F cooler at the mouth of Peterson Creek.  The seasonal 
maximum value at site PTR-14 was 78.0°F on July 22nd (Attachment A).

2.2.7 Naturally Occurring Scenario (ARM 17.30.602) 
 
The naturally occurring scenario defines water temperature conditions resulting from the 
implementation of all reasonable land, soil and water conservation practices as outlined in ARM 
17.30.602.  This scenario identifies the “naturally occurring” temperature in water bodies of 
interest and establishes the temperatures to which a 0.23°C (0.5°F) temperature increase is 
allowable.  This, in turn, can be used to identify the impairment status of a water body.  This 
scenario included improved shading in reaches PCT6 and PCT9 as suggested by shade scenario 2 
along with a 15% increase in irrigation and domestic water use efficiency.  This was calculated 
by reducing the three identified irrigation withdrawals by 15%.  The result of the naturally 
occurring scenario was similar to the result of shade scenario 2, with substantial reductions in 
temperature predicted in Peterson Creek downstream of the confluence with Jack Creek.  Based 
on the naturally occurring scenario, a maximum temperature of 68.6°F was predicted at the 
mouth of Peterson Creek and there is the potential for an approximately 10°F reduction in in-
stream temperatures relative to the baseline scenario (Attachment D).

2.3 Peterson Creek Modeled Temperature Relative to Montana Standards 
 
The naturally occurring scenario indicated that water temperatures greater than 66.5°F can be 
expected in Peterson Creek.  Thus, the maximum allowable increase in temperature due to 
unmitigated human causes is 0.5°F (0.23°C) (see Section 1.1).  This standard was exceeded at 
the lower-most four monitoring sites on Peterson Creek, which represents Peterson Creek from 
downstream of Jack Creek to the confluence with the Clark Fork River (Table 2-6, results for 
each modeling scenario presented in Attachment D).  The majority of the temperature reduction 
potential predicted by the QUAL2K model resulted from increased shade, as presented in shade 
scenario 2 (Figure 2-4), with an additional smaller reduction in temperatures resulting from 
improved irrigation and domestic water management.  As discussed in Section 2.2.3, the 
dramatic modeled temperature reductions were likely a result of the minimal flow in this small 
stream.  Due to the minimal amount of flow, there may be a substantial amount of error in the 
QUAL2K model.  However, temperature data collected in 2007 and the results of this QUAL2K 
modeling effort suggest that Peterson Creek fails to meet Montana’s standard for temperature 
during low flow periods in the middle of summer and that an increase in riparian shading, 
particularly along reaches PCT6 and PCT9 will likely lead to a decrease in water temperatures.

SECTION 3.0  
CONCLUSIONS 
 
This assessment indicated that Peterson Creek is impaired due to elevated water temperatures 
during low flow periods in the middle of summer.  Overall, the results of this study indicated that 
Peterson Creek downstream of the confluence with Jack Creek should be the focus of restoration 
efforts directed towards decreasing water temperatures in Peterson Creek.   
 
Major findings and restoration recommendations include: 
• 
Temperature data collected in 2007 and the results of this QUAL2K modeling 
effort suggest that Peterson Creek fails to meet Montana’s standard for 
temperature during low flow periods in the middle of summer. 
 
• 
Modeling indicated that increased shading in reaches PCT6 and PCT9 would 
likely have the greatest impact on water temperatures in Peterson Creek.  Reach 
PCT6 extends upstream of the Burnt Hollow Creek confluence, while Reach 
PCT9 flows through the town of Deer Lodge.  In 2007, maximum temperatures 
were observed at site PTR-12 in reach PCT7, which is located downstream of the 
Burnt Hollow Creek confluence.  This further supports the need for improved 
riparian shading upstream of this site.  
 
• 
Maximum streamflows were observed at PTR-12, which is located downstream of 
the Burnt Hollow Creek confluence.  Streamflows decreased by 80% between this 
site and the confluence with the Clark Fork River.  Thus, irrigation efficiency 
improvements should focus on Peterson Creek downstream of the confluence with 
Burnt Hollow Creek. 
 
Limitations of this study include a lack of detailed flow measurements for the irrigation network, 
a lack of reference conditions data for riparian shading, and potential limitations of the QUAL2K 
model when working with such a small stream.  Thus, the results of this assessment may need to 
be reevaluated as additional information becomes available.
