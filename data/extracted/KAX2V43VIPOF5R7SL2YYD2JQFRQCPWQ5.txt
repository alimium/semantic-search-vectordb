Bachus Enlists Congressional Support To Save Air National Guard Units
  
WASHINGTON- Congressman Spencer Bachus today sent a letter to House
Armed Services Committee Chairman Duncan Hunter requesting that he
hold a hearing on the Base Realignment and Closure Commission's decision
to realign the 117
th Air Refueling Wing and 22 similarly
situated air units.
  
 
  
Congressman Bachus was joined by members of the Alabama,
Delaware, Michigan, Missouri and Ohio delegations. Some of
the concerns the letter expressed were:
  
 
  
Â·        While Congress deemed "military value" to be the
overriding factor upon which the BRAC recommendations were
to be based, six Air National Guard Tanker wings determined to
have less military value than Birmingham are remaining in place
with some seeing an increase in aircraft.

Â·        To date, $73 million has been spent on Birmingham's
infrastructure to make it a world-class tanker base. There is
currently space to bed down 13 aircraft, and next year the
Birmingham International Airport runway will be lengthened to
12,000 feet, yielding an increased capability that is greater than
that of any of the airports to which the 117
th ARW aircraft
are to be relocated.
  
 
  
Â·        The ability of "enclave" bases to sustain expediti
onary 
c
ombat units is not clear.
  
Once flying units are removed, many bases will no
longer be able to support military or civilian aircraft
operations, and recruitment and retention could be
made more difficult.
