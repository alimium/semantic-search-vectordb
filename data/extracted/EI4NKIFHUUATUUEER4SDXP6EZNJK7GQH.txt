"I'm honored to be recognized by the National Small Business Association during my first term in Congress," Braley said. 
"I'm proud that my first bill to pass in the House was one to help small businesses compete.  Small businesses are the
backbone of Iowa's economy, and I will continue working to ensure that small businesses have the resources they need
to grow."  �

Last year, Braley introduced and passed the Small Business Fairness in Contracting Act, which would help small
businesses compete for government contracts.  Braley also introduced and passed the Plain Language Act, which would
make government documents easier to understand.  Braley is Chairman of the House Small Business Subcommittee on
Contracting and Technology.  �
