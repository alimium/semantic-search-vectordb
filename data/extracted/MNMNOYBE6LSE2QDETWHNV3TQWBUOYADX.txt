|   * Total ancestries tallied is the total number of people reporting each specific ancestry either first or second in their response to           |
|     the ancestry question. For example, someone responding "Irish−German−Dutch" is counted in both the Irish and German ancestry groups,          |
|     but the third response is not tallied.  Total tallies can be greater than the total population, even though many people left this             |
|     question unanswered.  This is the only question for which the Census Bureau did not impute any answers for non−respondents.                   |
|  ** Includes only people reporting "U.S." or "American" as their sole ancestry.  For example, "Irish−American" is tallied only as "Irish".        |
| *** Includes most reported ancestries which are equivalent to specific race & Hispanic/Latino groups, such as Cree, Thai, Samoan & Cuban.         |

| ** For Census 2000, persons could report more than one race, but the seven racial categories shown are mutually exclusive and include everyone.   |
|*** Hispanic/Latino origin is NOT considered a race. People who reported as Hispanic/Latino are also counted in the seven racial categories.       |
