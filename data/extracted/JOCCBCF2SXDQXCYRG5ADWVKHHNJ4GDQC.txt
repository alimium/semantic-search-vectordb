Environmental Assessment 
 
Summary  
Capitol Reef National Park (park), in cooperation with the Federal Highway Administration 
(FHWA), Central Federal Lands Highway Division (CFLHD), proposes to rehabilitate and 
resurface eight miles of the Scenic Drive roadway from the intersection with Utah State Route 
24 (SR-24) (milepost 0.0) and the parking lot for Capitol Gorge (milepost 8.0).  
The proposal to rehabilitate and resurface the Scenic Drive is needed because the roadway 
surface has deteriorated with signs of shoving and rutting, as well as deteriorated pavement 
edges, potholes, and bleeding and cracking failures. Cracking of the pavement is common 
within the travel lanes and along the shoulders. The roadway is threatened in some locations by 
eroding ditches and drainage channels. Some culverts are plugged with debris. Numerous 
culvert headwalls have become weakened because of erosion and deterioration of the mortar.  
This environmental assessment evaluates two alternatives: a no-action alternative and an action 
alternative. The no-action alternative describes the current road maintenance regimen of spot 
repairs and chip-sealing of the roadway as needed, with periodic repairs to individual drainage 
structures as the need arises. The park would respond to future needs and conditions without 
substantial actions or changes in the present maintenance regimen. 
 Under the proposed alternative, Rehabilitate and Resurface the Scenic Drive, the roadway 
would be rehabilitated and repaved with asphalt pavement or with chip-seal throughout its 8-
mile length. From the intersection with State Route 24, milepost (MP) 0.00, to the park fee 
station at MP 1.70, the existing pavement on the Scenic Drive would be pulverized and the 
roadway would be paved with asphalt concrete. Between the fee station and the Capitol Gorge 
parking area the existing chip-seal pavement would be pulverized, and the roadway would be 
paved with a double chip-seal overlay. Painted centerline striping would be applied from the 
picnic area and campground in the Fruita Historic District to the intersection with SR-24. 
Centerline striping may also be applied at some of the sharpest curves, to enhance safety. 
Rumble strips would be installed at the beginning of the 15-mile-per-hour speed zone. Minor 
improvements would be made to the Fruita Campground entrance to provide additional width for 
turning movements into and out of the campground. Paved asphalt aprons would be developed 
and extended into the entrances of Grand Wash and the Pleasant Creek Road. 
 Existing concrete low water crossings would be repaired or replaced in kind as needed. Cut 
and fill slope erosion and slumping along the roadway would be repaired as needed. The 
Capitol Gorge parking area would be paved with asphalt pavement. Some existing minor 
parking areas and pullouts would be reconstructed and formalized. Vegetated areas disturbed 
by construction activities would be revegetated with native plants and seeds. Existing roadway 
signs would be replaced.  
Damaged and deteriorating culverts (historic and non-historic) would be repaired and/or 
reconstructed, and new culverts would be installed where needed. The NPS considers the 
Scenic Drive as potentially eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places. 
Therefore, all masonry stone rehabilitation would be completed in accordance with the 
Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for the Preservation of Historic Properties. Consultation 
with the Utah State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) was conducted under a separate 
United States Department of the Interior • National Park Service • Capitol Reef National Park 
 
submittal in compliance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation of 1966, as 
amended.  
This environmental assessment has been prepared in compliance with the National 
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) to provide the decision-making framework that 1) analyzes a 
reasonable range of alternatives to meet objectives of the proposal, 2) evaluates potential 
issues and impacts to Capitol Reef National Park’s resources and values, and 3) identifies 
mitigation measures to lessen the degree or extent of these impacts. Resource topics analyzed 
in detail in this document include cultural landscapes; soundscape; soils and geology; health 
and safety; visitor use and experience; and park operations and management. All other 
resource topics were dismissed because the project would have negligible or minor impacts on 
those resources. No major impacts are anticipated as a result of this project.

PURPOSE AND NEED   
Introduction  
Capitol Reef National Park (park) is located in southern Utah in Wayne, Garfield, Sevier, and 
Emery Counties, Utah. The headquarters area and the project areas are located east of the 
town of Torrey, in Wayne County, Utah. Capitol Reef was first established as a national 
monument on August 2, 1937 by Presidential Proclamation 2246 (50 Stat. 1856). The 
monument originally comprised 37,060 acres. Additional lands were added to the monument by 
Presidential Proclamation 3249 of July 2, 1958 and Presidential Proclamation 3888 of January 
20, 1969. On December 18, 1971, Congress abolished Capitol Reef National Monument and 
established Capitol Reef National Park, with its final boundaries encompassing 241,903 acres 
(85 Stat. 639, 16 U.S.C. §273 et seq.). The park is managed by the National Park Service.  
This environmental assessment (EA) will examine the environmental impacts associated with 
the proposal to repair and resurface the entire 8-mile length of the asphalt-paved and chip-
sealed Scenic Drive roadway between SR-24 and the parking lot for Capitol Gorge. This EA 
was prepared in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969, 
regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) (40 CFR §1508.9), and the National 
Park Service Director’s Order (DO)-12 (Conservation Planning, Environmental Impact Analysis, 
and Decision-Making). Figure 1 depicts the location of the Scenic Drive.  
Background 
The Scenic Drive is a hard-surfaced road that extends between Utah State Road 24 (Utah SR-
24) and Capitol Gorge. The narrow and twisting road, a popular driving route used by park 
visitors, has numerous concrete-paved low water crossings that are sometimes impassable 
during seasonal flash flooding. It connects with spur roads accessing popular hiking and scenic 
locales, and it is the primary scenic tour road within the park. Much of the Scenic Drive was 
chip-sealed in 1988. The improvements made the road more attractive to visitors in passenger 
vehicles and motor homes, and traffic and use of trails in the area increased. The use of large 
recreational vehicles on the narrow, winding, and shoulderless road has created safety 
concerns. Cyclists and pedestrians, in combination with the large vehicles and other traffic, add 
to those concerns.  
Purpose and Need 
The purpose of the proposal to repair and resurface the Scenic Drive between SR-24 and the 
parking lot for Capitol Gorge is to maintain a safe and reliable roadway, while providing the 
National Park Service (NPS) the opportunity to meet and uphold its mandate to administer and 
protect the park for the enjoyment of natural, cultural, and scientific resources in a manner that 
leaves these resources unimpaired.  
The Scenic Drive is in need of repair. The roadway surface has deteriorated, with signs of 
shoving and rutting, as well as deteriorated pavement edges, potholes, and bleeding and 
cracking failures. Such damage occurs within the travel lanes in locations where the subgrade 
becomes saturated because of poor drainage, and along the edges of the pavement where 
there is little shoulder support. The roadway is threatened in some locations by eroding ditches 
and drainage channels. Plugged or undersized culverts in some locations force seasonal runoff 
to flow across the road, eroding the pavement and the roadway bench. Numerous stone 
headwalls have become weakened and are threatened with failure, because of erosion and 
deterioration of the mortar.

Poorly defined drainage ditches also cause roadway overtopping and roadway shoulder erosion 
in some locations. Some concrete paved low water crossings have erosion damage. Figures 2 
through 11 illustrate some of the repair needs.  
 
The objectives of the proposed project are to:  
Improve the Efficiency of Park Operations 
• 
Repair damaged and deteriorating road pavement, drainage, stone masonry 
retaining walls, headwalls, and other structural features 
• 
Reduce maintenance requirements and costs due to deficiencies in the condition of 
the road  
Provide for Visitor Enjoyment and Safety 
• 
Improve the roadway condition to more safely accommodate traffic 
• 
Reduce the incidence and risk of traffic accidents 
• 
Efficiently implement rehabilitation work while minimizing visitor impact 
Protect Park Resources  
• 
Maintain the scenic quality of the road  
• 
Protect park natural and cultural resources and values 
Relationship to Other Plans and Policies 
This proposal is consistent with the objectives of the Capitol Reef National Park Final 
Environmental Impact Statement, General Management Plan, and Development Concept Plan 
(1998), which outlines the management, use, and development of the Park through the year 
2013. The proposal is consistent with the 2006 National Park Service Management Policies goals 
and objectives for natural resource and cultural resource management, use of the park, 
transportation systems, park facilities, and visitor facilities. 
It is consistent with the objectives of the 1984 NPS Park Roads Standards, which states that 
roads in national parks serve a distinctly different purpose from most other road and highway 
systems. Park roads are to be designed with extreme care and sensitivity to provide access for 
the protection, use, and enjoyment of the resources that constitute the national park system. 
It is consistent with Director’s Order – 87A, which states that park roads are constructed only 
where necessary to provide access for the protection, use, and enjoyment of the natural, 
historical, cultural, and recreational resources that constitute our national park system. Park 
roads should enhance the visitor experience while providing safe and efficient accommodation 
of park visitors and to serve essential management action needs. Park roads are designed with 
extreme care and sensitivity with respect to the terrain and environment through which they 
pass—they are laid lightly onto the land. 
Appropriate Use 
Section 1.5 of 2006 National Park Service Management Policies, “Appropriate Use of the Parks,” 
directs that the National Park Service must ensure that park uses that are allowed would not 
cause impairment of, or unacceptable impacts on, park resources and values. A form of park 
use may be allowed within a park only after a determination has been made in the professional 
judgment of the park manager that it will not result in unacceptable impacts.

Section 8.1.2 of 2006 National Park Service Management Policies, Process for Determining 
Appropriate Uses, provides evaluation factors for determining appropriate uses. All proposals 
for park uses are evaluated for: 
• 
consistency with applicable laws, executive orders, regulations, and policies;  
• 
consistency with existing plans for public use and resource management;  
• 
actual and potential effects on park resources and values;  
• 
total costs to the Service; and  
• 
whether the public interest will be served.  
Park managers must continually monitor all park uses to prevent unanticipated and 
unacceptable impacts. If unanticipated and unacceptable impacts emerge, the park manager 
must engage in a thoughtful, deliberate process to further manage or constrain the use, or 
discontinue it.  
From Section 8.2 of 2006 National Park Service Management Policies: “To provide for enjoyment 
of the parks, the National Park Service will encourage visitor use activities that  
• 
are appropriate to the purpose for which the park was established, and  
• 
are inspirational, educational, or healthful, and otherwise appropriate to the park 
environment; and  
• 
will foster an understanding of and appreciation for park resources and values, or will 
promote enjoyment through a direct association with, interaction with, or relation to park 
resources; and  
• 
can be sustained without causing unacceptable impacts to park resources and values.  
The Scenic Drive, in its present configuration, has been in continuous use since it was 
constructed. The proposed rehabilitation of the Scenic Drive is consistent with the park’s 
general management plan and other related park plans. The NPS finds that maintaining 
automobile access along the Scenic Drive and to trailheads and other points of interest along 
the road is an acceptable use at Capitol Reef National Park. 
Scoping   
Capitol Reef National Park conducted internal scoping with appropriate National Park Service 
staff, as described in more detail in the Consultation and Coordination chapter. The park also 
conducted external scoping with the State of Utah Historic Preservation Office and 
interested/affected groups. More information regarding external scoping can be found in 
Comments and Coordination.

Impact Topics Retained for Further Analysis   
In this section and the following section on Impact Topics Dismissed from Further Analysis, the 
NPS analyzes all potential impacts by considering the direct, indirect, and cumulative effects of 
the proposed action on the environment, along with connected and cumulative actions. Impacts 
are described in terms of context and duration. The context or extent of the impact is described 
as localized or widespread. The duration of impacts is described as short-term or long-term. The 
intensity and type of impact is described as negligible, minor, moderate, or major, and as 
beneficial or adverse. The NPS equates “major” effects as “significant” effects. The identification 
of “major” effects would trigger the need for an EIS. Where the intensity of an impact could be 
described quantitatively, the numerical data are presented; however, most impact analyses are 
qualitative and use best professional judgment in making the assessment.  
If there is no effect or no measurable effect, there would either be no contribution to cumulative 
effects, or the contribution would be low. For each issue or topic presented below, if the 
resource is found in the analysis area or the issue is applicable to the proposal, then a limited 
analysis of direct and indirect, and cumulative effects is presented. There is no impairment 
analysis included in the limited evaluations for the dismissed topics because the NPS’s 
threshold for considering whether there could be an impairment is based on “major” effects.  
Impact topics for this project have been identified on the basis of federal laws, regulations, and 
orders; 2006 National Park Service Management Policies; and National Park Service knowledge 
of resources at Capitol Reef National Park. Impact topics that are carried forward for further 
analysis in this EA are listed below along with the reasons why the impact topic is further 
analyzed.  
Cultural Landscapes 
According to the Director’s Order # 28, “Cultural Resource Management Guideline,” a cultural 
landscape is  “. . . a reflection of human adaptation and use of natural resources and is often 
expressed in the way land is organized and divided, patterns of settlement, land use, systems of 
circulation, and the types of structures that are built. The character of a cultural landscape is 
defined by both physical materials, such as roads, buildings, walls, and vegetation, and by use 
reflecting cultural values.” 
The NPS has identified the Scenic Drive/Capitol Gorge landscape as potentially eligible for 
listing in the National Register of Historic Places. Constructed in 1883, the road now known as 
the Scenic Drive was little more than a wagon trail that connected the farming community of 
Fruita to Torrey, Notom and other communities nearby. Prior to the rerouting and paving of a 
section of Utah Highway 24 through Fremont Canyon in 1962, the old route south of Fruita 
through Capitol Gorge (now part of the Scenic Drive) was the main road through the 
Waterpocket Fold, a route formerly used by Native Americans for centuries. Fruita, a Mormon 
farming community, was founded in 1880. The northern 1.7-mile section of the Scenic Drive that 
passes through the community is considered a contributing feature of the Fruita Rural Historic 
District, which was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1997.  
Properties more than fifty years old may be eligible for the National Register if they meet the 
criteria for listing and for contributions at the national, state, or local level. In order for a property 
to be listed in the National Register, it also must possess historic integrity of those features 
necessary to convey its significance, i.e., location, design, setting, workmanship, materials, 
feeling, and association. The Fruita landscape was determined eligible because its original land 
use patterns, particularly its historic fruit orchards, remain relatively intact. The Fruita Historic 
Capitol Reef National Park 
 
 
10
 
Resurface the 8-Mile Scenic Drive Road Environmental Assessment 
 
 
 
District landscape also contains 14 historic buildings, including a schoolhouse, two homes, 
outbuildings and cellars, and a distilling site.  
In the early 1940s, the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) completed improvements to the 
Scenic Drive, including construction of culverts and other drainage features. However, historic 
records do not indicate how many of these features pre-dated the CCC era. It is unclear which 
drainage features date to the CCC era, and which were constructed earlier and simply repaired 
or rebuilt between 1938 and 1942. The Scenic Drive currently has 64 culverts and 22 low water 
crossings. An inventory of culverts completed by park staff in 2009 identified six that are known 
or are likely to have been constructed by the CCC, in addition to another 31 possible CCC-era 
drainage features. Alterations were subsequently made to the road during the later Mission 66 
period of NPS development (1945-1967), but the overall historic alignment and drainage 
structures of the road remain relatively intact. The proposed Scenic Drive rehabilitation project 
described in this EA would have the potential to impact the historic features of the Scenic Drive 
and Fruita landscapes. For these reasons, the topic of cultural landscapes has been carried 
forward for further analysis in this document. 
Soundscape 
Soundscape refers to the total ambient acoustic environment associated with a given 
environment (sonic environment) in an area such as a national park. It is also refers to the total 
ambient sound level for the park. In a national park setting, this soundscape is usually 
composed of both natural ambient sounds and a variety of human-made sounds.  
In accordance with 2006 National Park Service Management Policies and Director’s Order 47 – 
Sound Preservation and Noise Management, an important component of the National Park 
Service’s mission is the preservation of natural soundscapes associated with national park 
units. Natural soundscapes exist in the absence of human-caused sound. The natural ambient 
soundscape is the aggregate of all the natural sounds that occur in a park unit, together with the 
physical capacity for transmitting natural sounds.   
With either alternative discussed in this EA, human-caused noise, caused by visitors and their 
vehicles as well as by park maintenance activities, would intrude upon the natural soundscape. 
The preferred alternative would result in more construction noise than the no action alternative. 
The majority of construction noise would occur from April to October. Effects to the natural 
soundscape during daylight hours would be clearly detectable, localized, and periodic. 
Therefore, soundscape was addressed as an impact topic in this EA.  
Geology and Soils  
According to the 2006 National Park Service Management Policies, the National Park Service will 
preserve and protect geologic resources and features from adverse effects of human activity, 
while allowing natural processes to continue (NPS 2006). These policies also state that the 
National Park Service will strive to understand and preserve the soil resources of park units and 
to prevent, to the extent possible, the unnatural erosion, physical removal, or contamination of 
the soil, or its contamination of other resources.  
The proposed repairs and rehabilitation of the Scenic Drive would be mostly confined to the 
existing road bench, but some excavation would be needed to widen the roadway in a few 
locations to achieve a consistent width, and to widen some sharp “S-shaped” curves to improve 
safety. The proposed project would also require excavation in selected areas under the road 
surface to reconstruct the subgrade, displacing and disturbing soils. Soils would also be 
disturbed and compacted in one of the staging areas. 
Capitol Reef National Park 
 
 
11
 
Resurface the 8-Mile Scenic Drive Road Environmental Assessment 
 
 
 
Because the proposed actions would impact geology and soils this topic has been carried 
forward for further analysis. 
Health and Safety 
The NPS is committed to providing appropriate, high-quality opportunities for visitors and 
employees to enjoy the parks in a safe and healthful environment. The goals of the park include 
ensuring that basic visitor needs are met in keeping with the park purposes, and that visitor and 
employee safety and health are protected. To the extent feasible, facilities, programs, and 
services in the park are accessible to and usable by all people, including those with disabilities 
(NPS 2004b).  
One of the primary purposes of this proposed project is to improve safety. The NPS also wants 
to keep the roadway and associated park resources open during construction and, as a result, 
protective measures need to be studied and implemented to ensure safety to motorists and 
visitors. Because the proposed project would affect health and safety of park staff and visitors, 
this topic has been carried forward for further analysis. 
Visitor Use and Experience 
According to 2006 National Park Service Management Policies, the enjoyment of park resources 
and values by people is part of the fundamental purpose of all park units (NPS 2006). The 
National Park Service is committed to providing appropriate, high quality opportunities for 
visitors to enjoy the parks, and will maintain within the parks an atmosphere that is open, 
inviting, and accessible to every segment of society. Further, the National Park Service will 
provide opportunities for forms of enjoyment that are uniquely suited and appropriate to the 
superlative natural and cultural resources found in the parks. The 2006 National Park Service 
Management Policies also state that scenic views and visual resources are considered highly 
valued associated characteristics that the National Park Service should strive to protect (NPS 
2006).  
Taking a self-guided tour of the Scenic Drive is one of the principal activities available to park 
visitors. The average number of visitors who travel the Scenic Drive annually is around 70,000. 
The average visitor length of stay for people who travel to the visitor center and the Scenic Drive 
is 3 hours. Those who opt for the self-guided tour along the Scenic Drive are able to travel 
through the historic settlement of Fruita and stop at eleven locations along the western face of 
the Waterpocket Fold that offer spectacular scenic views of notable geologic formations. The 
Scenic Drive also offers access to exploration of Grand Wash and Capitol Gorge. Because the 
proposed project would affect visitor use and experience of these park resources, this topic has 
been carried forward for further analysis. 
Park Operations and Management  
Park operations and management would be affected by implementation of either the no-action 
alternative or the action alternative (alternative B). Either alternative would require repair and 
maintenance activities on the Scenic Drive. Construction activities on the Scenic Drive would 
require temporary changes in park operations to address traffic control and keep the public 
informed about road conditions. Therefore, the topic of park operations has been carried 
forward for further analysis in this document. 
Impact Topics Dismissed From Further Analysis   
In this section of the EA, NPS provides a limited evaluation and explanation as to why some 
impact topics are not evaluated in more detail. Impact topics are dismissed from further 
evaluation in this EA if:

• 
they do not exist in the analysis area, or 
• 
they would not be affected by the proposal, or the likelihood of impacts are not reasonably 
expected, or  
• 
through the application of mitigation measures, the effects from the proposal would be minor 
or less, and there is little controversy on the subject or reasons to otherwise include the 
topic. 
Vegetation and Invasive Exotic Plants  
According to the 2006 National Park Service Management Policies, the National Park Service 
strives to maintain all components and processes of naturally evolving park unit ecosystems, 
including the natural abundance, diversity, and ecological integrity of plants (NPS 2006).  
Construction activities on the roadway shoulders and immediately adjacent areas would 
displace native vegetation and would provide conditions favorable for the establishment of 
invasive exotic plants, but the impacts would be mitigated by control measures, such as a 
revegetation plan, restricting construction activities to specified areas, and other mitigation 
measures identified in this EA. The impacts would be negligible to minor, because the areas 
where conditions would be favorable for invasion by exotic plants would be relatively small, 
including the road shoulders and areas immediately adjacent to the roadway. The impacts 
would be short-term because those areas would be revegetated with native species and the 
spread of invasive exotic plants would be controlled.  
 Such negligible or minor impacts would not result in any unacceptable impacts; the proposed 
actions are consistent with §1.4.7.1 of 2006 National Park Service Management Policies. 
Because these effects are minor or less in degree and would not result in any unacceptable 
impacts, this topic is dismissed from further analysis in this document.  
Wildlife  
The NPS Organic Act, which directs parks to conserve wildlife unimpaired for future 
generations, is interpreted by the NPS to mean that native animal life should be protected and 
perpetuated as part of the park’s natural ecosystem. Natural processes are relied on to control 
populations of native species to the greatest extent possible; otherwise they are protected from 
harm by human activities. Management goals for wildlife include maintaining components and 
processes of naturally evolving park ecosystems, including natural abundance, diversity, and 
the ecological integrity of plants and animals. 
Wildlife commonly found in the proposed project area include mule deer, coyotes, bighorn 
sheep, marmots, fox, woodrats, ringtails, chipmunks, ground squirrels, jackrabbits, bats, 
kangaroo rats, mice, and many species of birds. There are also numerous insect species, 
amphibians, and reptiles.  
Neither of the alternatives would impact the overall abundance, diversity, or ecological integrity 
of animals, nor inhibit the processes of park ecosystems. Wildlife habitat would be adversely 
affected adjacent to the road along its length, e.g. through the removal of vegetation and soils. 
Those impacts would be measurable, but they would not affect native species’ populations or 
the natural processes sustaining them, beyond their natural range of variability. Mitigation 
measures, such as replanting disturbed areas with native vegetation, would be in accordance 
with conventional best management practices, and would have a high likelihood of success. The 
long-term adverse impact to wildlife would be minor.  
Capitol Reef National Park

During construction, noise would also increase, which may disturb wildlife in the general area. 
Construction-related noise would be temporary, and existing sound conditions would resume 
following construction activities. Therefore, the temporary noise from construction would have a 
negligible to minor adverse effect on wildlife.  
Such negligible to minor impacts would not result in any unacceptable impacts; the proposed 
actions are consistent with §1.4.7.1 of 2006 National Park Service Management Policies. 
Because these effects are minor or less in degree and would not result in any unacceptable 
impacts, this topic is dismissed from further analysis in this document.  
Special Status Species 
For federally sponsored projects, the Endangered Species Act (Act) of 1973 (as amended) 
requires examination of potential impacts to Threatened, Endangered, and Candidate Species. 
Section 7 of the Act requires federal agencies to ensure that any activities they authorize, fund, 
or implement, do not jeopardize the continued existence of any wildlife species federally listed 
as threatened or endangered and do not destroy or adversely modify designated critical habitat. 
NPS policy requires examination of potential impacts on federal candidate species, as well as 
state-listed threatened, endangered, candidate, rare, declining, and sensitive species with 
potential to occur within the project area. For simplicity, the federal and state-listed species 
identified in this EA are collectively described as Special Status Species. 
A population of a National Park Service sensitive plant, the rush lomatium, has been identified in 
the vicinity of the Scenic Drive. Park staff have determined that those plants will not be affected 
by the proposed repair and rehabilitation of the Scenic Drive. 
Park staff reviewed the Utah Conservation Data Center website and generated a list of Species 
of Special Concern for the project area. The database identified five state-listed animal species 
that could potentially occur within the project area (Utah Conservation Data Center 10/30/2009); 
Table 1.  
The NPS has no record of federally listed species occurring within the project area, and recent 
field examinations by park staff confirm that. The southwestern willow flycatcher has the 
potential to occur within the project area, but there is no suitable nesting habitat for the species 
in or near the project area.

A portion of the proposed project area lies within designated critical habitat for the Mexican 
spotted owl, and is near a protected activity center (PAC). The PAC has historically been 
occupied by young and adult owls. However, a nest site has never been found. The most recent 
detection of a Mexican spotted owl in the area was in1996, when a single male was observed. 
Subsequent surveys were conducted in 1997, 2001, 2008, and 2009; no owls have been 
detected. Based upon those survey data, construction activities associated with the proposed 
project would not be expected to affect nesting or roosting Mexican spotted owls. Construction 
activities are not expected to adversely affect any of the primary constituent elements of the 
critical habitat or to adversely modify critical habitat.  In a letter dated December 3, 2009 the 
NPS provided a list of federally listed and candidate species that could potentially occur in the 
project area to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), and sought concurrence that the 
proposed action would not adversely affect listed or candidate species or proposed or 
designated critical habitat. The USFWS concurred on December 15, 2009 that the proposed 
Capitol Reef National Park 
 
 
15
 
Resurface the 8-Mile Scenic Drive Road Environmental Assessment 
 
 
 
action was "not likely to adversely affect" any listed species, including Mexican spotted owls. 
The NPS consultation and the USFWS concurrence are presented in Appendix A of this EA. No 
adverse impacts to Threatened and Endangered Species would be anticipated with 
implementation of the proposed action, and the proposed action would not result in any 
unacceptable impacts. The proposed actions are consistent with §1.4.7.1 of 2006 National Park 
Service Management Policies. Because there would be no adverse impacts or any unacceptable 
impacts, this topic is dismissed from further analysis.  
Water Resources 
National Park Service policies require protection of water quality consistent with the Clean 
Water Act. The purpose of the Clean Water Act is to "restore and maintain the chemical, 
physical, and biological integrity of the Nation's waters."  To enact this goal, the U.S. Army 
Corps of Engineers has been charged with evaluating federal actions that result in potential 
degradation of waters of the United States and issuing permits for actions consistent with the 
Clean Water Act. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency also has responsibility for 
oversight and review of permits and actions, which affect waters of the United States.  
The Scenic Drive crosses the Fremont River at one location in the Fruita Historic District, but the 
rest of the proposed project area does not contain surface waters. It is mostly dry, except for 
periodic flooding during sudden storm events.  
A National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit would be prepared by 
CFLHD and submitted to the Utah Division of Water Quality prior to commencing any near-
water activities. As authorized by the Clean Water Act, the NPDES permit program controls 
water pollution by regulating conveyances such as pipes or man-made ditches that discharge 
pollutants into waters of the United States.  
A hazardous spill plan would be required from the contractor prior to the start of construction 
stating what actions would be taken in the case of a spill and preventive measures to be 
implemented. Hazardous spill clean-up materials would be on-site at all times.  
Because of the mitigation benefits of the NPDES permit and a hazardous spill plan, and 
because most of the Scenic Drive is well removed from surface waters, the impacts to water 
quality and drinking water would be negligible. Water quantity would not be affected. Because 
the effects on water resources would be no greater than negligible and would not result in any 
unacceptable impacts, the topic is dismissed from further analysis in this document. 
Wetlands  
For the purpose of implementing Executive Order 11990 Protection of Wetlands, any area that 
is classified as a wetland according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's "Classification of 
Wetlands and Deepwater Habitats of the United States" (Cowardin et al. 1979) is subject to 
Director’s Order #77-1: Wetland Protection (D.O. 77-1) and its implementation procedures as 
presented in Procedural Manual #77-1: Wetland Protection (2008). The Cowardin classification 
system forms the basis for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's National Wetlands Inventory 
(NWI) mapping program. Under the Cowardin definition, a wetland must have one or more of 
the following three attributes:  
1. at least periodically, the land supports predominantly hydrophytes (wetland vegetation);  
2. the substrate is predominantly undrained hydric soil; or  
3. the substrate is non-soil and is saturated with water or covered by shallow water at some time 
during the growing season of each year.  
Capitol Reef National Park 
 
 
16
 
Resurface the 8-Mile Scenic Drive Road Environmental Assessment 
 
 
 
Most of the dry washes within the project area meet the third attribute listed above, and 
therefore are considered wetlands. 
Channels or similar features that are used for the sole purpose of active stormwater or 
wastewater are not considered wetlands for purposes of Procedural Manual #77-1. Therefore, 
drainage ditches alongside the Scenic Drive road bed are not considered wetlands.  
Executive Order 11990 requires federal agencies to avoid, where possible, adversely impacting 
wetlands. Further, §404 of the Clean Water Act authorizes the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to 
prohibit or regulate, through a permitting process, discharge of dredged or fill material or 
excavation within waters of the United States. National Park Service policies for wetlands, as 
stated in 2006 National Park Service Management Policies and D.O. 77-1 strive to prevent the 
loss or degradation of wetlands and to preserve and enhance the natural and beneficial values 
of wetlands. In accordance with D.O. 77-1, proposed actions that have the potential to adversely 
impact wetlands must be addressed in a statement of findings for wetlands.  
Some actions may be excepted from the statement of findings and compensation requirements 
(D.O. 77-1, 4.2.1). They include maintenance, repair, or renovation (but not full reconstruction or 
expansion) of currently serviceable facilities or structures: 
- that were under construction or were completed prior to May 28, 1980, but whose retention 
has been reviewed and justified, or 
- that were completed after publication of the May 28, 1980 guidelines, and for which 
compliance with them is on record. 
This exception allows for minor deviations (total of 0.1 acre or less throughout the entire project) 
in the structure's configuration or fill footprint in wetlands due to subsequent changes in 
construction codes, methods, or safety standards (e.g., handicap accessibility), but does not 
apply to other types of reconstruction/expansion (e.g., road widening to increase capacity, road 
re-routing) or conversion to other uses that would have additional adverse impacts on wetlands. 
In order to eliminate future erosion, which could create scour holes, it is anticipated that outlet 
protection would be constructed below drain outfalls in some naturally-occurring dry washes. 
Some of the washes meet the Cowardin definition of riverine intermittent wetlands. Such dry 
washes are common throughout the park and the geographic area. The outlet protection 
features would vary in size, depending on conditions in the washes. The outlet protection 
features might incorporate stone riprap or concrete in colors matching the surrounding soil.   
The FHWA estimated in the October 5, 2009 Preliminary Design Study Report – Draft, Appendix 
C, that less than 0.1 acre would be impacted by construction of outlet protection in the washes. 
Because the repair and rehabilitation of the Scenic drive would adversely impact less than 0.1 
acre of wetlands, and because the impacts of the proposed work meet the conditions in 
Appendix 2 of D.O. 77-1, that rehabilitation work would be an excepted action. Therefore, it will 
not be necessary to prepare a wetland statement of findings as part of this environmental 
assessment, and compensation for the wetland impacts will not be required.  
The adverse effects on wetlands would be minor or less. They would be detectable, but 
relatively small in terms of area and the nature of the change. The action would affect a limited 
number of individuals of plant or wildlife species within the wetland, but all species would remain 
viable. Because the effects would be no greater than minor and would not result in any 
unacceptable impacts, this topic has been dismissed from further analysis in this document.

Floodplains  
Executive Order 11988 Floodplain Management requires all federal agencies to avoid 
construction within the 100-year floodplain unless no other practicable alternative exists. The 
National Park Service under 2006 National Park Service Management Policies and Director’s 
Order 77-2 Floodplain Management will strive to preserve floodplain values and minimize 
hazardous floodplain conditions. According to Director’s Order 77-2 Floodplain Management, 
certain construction within a 100-year floodplain requires preparation of a statement of findings 
for floodplains.  
A floodplain statement of findings was completed for the park GMP EIS in 1998 (NPS 1998, 
Appendix F), based on mapping of the Fruita area in 1995. The northern portion of the Scenic 
Drive from the picnic area to the Gifford barn is within the 100-year floodplain. Areas to the 
south have not been mapped. However, the Scenic Drive is considered an excepted action 
under the NPS final procedures for implementing Executive Order 11988, because the section 
of the Scenic Drive that passes through the Fruita area is considered a contributing feature of 
the Fruita Rural Historic District, which was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 
1997. The NPS also considers the Scenic Drive/Capitol Gorge as a separate component 
landscape within the park that is potentially eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic 
Places. The Floodplain Management manual does not apply to historic structures whose 
location is integral to their significance.  
Pavement pulverization and road repaving within the existing roadway footprint, and repairs to 
culverts and low water crossings would be the only work on the floodplain. There would be no 
change in the ability of a floodplain to convey floodwaters, or its values and functions. The 
proposed project would not contribute to flooding. The proposed project would not result in 
significant or unacceptable impacts to floodplain values, and the proposed actions are 
consistent with §1.4.7.1 of 2006 National Park Service Management Policies. Therefore, this 
topic is dismissed from further analysis in this document. 
Historic structures  
There are 14 historic structures within the park. Only one of these, the Gifford barn, is situated 
in close proximity to the Scenic Drive within the Fruita Rural Historic District. The structure is 
separated from the road by a non-historic post-and-rail fence (see Figure 5). The barn is 
associated with the Gifford farm complex, which was constructed circa 1900. It is a rectangular, 
post-and-beam building with vertical plank siding.  
The proposed road work may include resetting two fence posts in proximity to the Gifford Barn 
to allow for a clear zone at the road shoulder. However, there would be negligible impacts to the 
setting of this historic structure. Because these effects are less than minor in degree and would 
not result in unacceptable impacts, this topic is dismissed from further analysis in this document. 
Archeological Resources  
In August 2009, a Phase I archeological survey of the Scenic Drive was completed (Bonnifield 
2009). A total of eight sites were recorded in proximity to the Scenic Drive; two are considered 
eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places. However, the proposed road 
construction activities are not expected to impact archeological resources because construction 
activities would be confined to the road bench and designated staging areas. In addition, all 
construction activities conducted in proximity to the two National Register-eligible sites would be 
monitored by a professional archeologist.  
 
Capitol Reef National Park

The survey report was included in a submittal package to the Utah SHPO on January 19, 2010, 
as required under the consultation provisions of Section 106 of the NHPA of 1966, as amended. 
The SHPO consultation letter, with SHPO concurrence, is included in Appendix B of this EA.  
Because these effects are less than minor in degree and would not result in unacceptable 
impacts, this topic is dismissed from further analysis in this document. In the unlikely event that 
human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony are 
discovered during construction, provisions outlined in the Native American Graves Protection 
and Repatriation Act (25 USC 3002) of 1990 would be followed. 
Ethnographic Resources 
National Park Service’s Director’s Order-28 Cultural Resource Management defines 
ethnographic resources as any site, structure, object, landscape, or natural resource feature 
assigned traditional legendary, religious, subsistence, or other significance in the cultural 
system of a group traditionally associated with it. According to DO-28 and Executive Order 
13007 on sacred sites, the National Park Service should try to preserve and protect 
ethnographic resources.  
Ethnographic resources are not known to exist in the proposed project area. Native American 
tribes traditionally associated with the park will receive copies of this document for their review 
and comment. If subsequent issues or concerns are identified, appropriate consultations will be 
undertaken. Because these effects are less than minor in degree and would not result in any 
unacceptable impacts, this topic is dismissed from further analysis in this document. 
Museum Collections  
Museum collections include historic artifacts, natural specimens, and archival and manuscript 
material. They may be threatened by fire, vandalism, natural disasters, and careless acts. The 
National Park Service requires the consideration of impacts on museum collections (historic 
artifacts, natural specimens, and archival and manuscript material), and provides further policy 
guidance, standards, and requirements for preserving, protecting, documenting, and providing 
access to, and use of, National Park Service museum collections. The proposed activities would 
not require additional curatorial services or increase the number of museum objects at the park; 
therefore, museum objects were dismissed from further analysis in this document. 
Air Quality  
The Clean Air Act of 1963 (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.) was established to promote the public health 
and welfare by protecting and enhancing the nation’s air quality. The act establishes specific 
programs that provide special protection for air resources and air quality related values 
associated with National Park Service units. Section 118 of the Clean Air Act requires a park 
unit to meet all federal, state, and local air pollution standards. Capitol Reef National Park is 
designated as a Class I air quality area under the Clean Air Act. A Class I area is subject to the 
most stringent regulations of any designation, and must not exceed the maximum allowable 
increment over baseline concentrations of sulfur dioxide and particulate matter as specified in 
Section 163 of the 1963 Clean Air Act. Further, the Act provides that the federal land manager 
has an affirmative responsibility to protect air quality related values (including visibility, plants, 
animals, soils, water quality, cultural resources, and visitor health) from adverse pollution 
impacts (EPA 2000). The air quality at Capitol Reef is generally very good; occasionally, 
particulate levels in the area are high due to high winds, as is typical in a desert environment.  
Construction activities such as hauling materials and operating heavy equipment could result in 
temporary increases of vehicle exhaust, emissions, and fugitive dust in the general project area. 
Capitol Reef National Park 
 
 
19
 
Resurface the 8-Mile Scenic Drive Road Environmental Assessment 
 
 
 
During construction the contractor would be required to implement dust control mitigation 
procedures to reduce the particulate matter. Additional mitigation measures that would be 
implemented include: allowing construction vehicles to idle up to but not exceeding 5 minutes 
when parked. Any exhaust, emissions, and fugitive dust generated from construction activities 
would be temporary and localized and would likely dissipate rapidly because air stagnation at 
Capitol Reef National Park is rare. Overall, the project could result in a negligible degradation of 
local air quality, and such effects would be temporary, lasting only as long as construction. The 
Class I air quality designation for Capitol Reef National Park would not be affected by the 
proposal. Because the Class I air quality would not be affected and the proposed actions are 
consistent with §1.4.7.1 of 2006 National Park Service Management Policies, and because there 
would negligible effects on air quality, this topic is dismissed from further analysis in this 
document. 
Lightscape Management  
In accordance with 2006 National Park Service Management Policies, the National Park Service 
strives to preserve natural ambient lightscapes, which are natural resources and values that 
exist in the absence of human caused light (NPS 2006). Capitol Reef National Park strives to 
limit the use of artificial outdoor lighting to that which is necessary for basic safety requirements. 
The park also strives to ensure that all outdoor lighting is shielded to the maximum extent 
possible, to keep light on the intended subject and out of the night sky. 
The current impact of light pollution along the Scenic Drive is localized and negligible, lasting as 
long as it takes for a vehicle to pass. No additional artificial lighting or any actions that would 
increase nighttime visitors are proposed under the preferred alternative. Further, such impacts 
are negligible in degree. Because the effects are negligible and would not result in any 
unacceptable impacts, this topic is dismissed from further analysis in this document. 
Socioeconomics 
The proposed action would neither change local and regional land use nor appreciably impact 
local businesses or other agencies. Implementation of the proposed action could provide a 
negligible beneficial impact to the economy of the gateway community of Torrey and Wayne 
County due to minimal increases in employment opportunities for the construction workforce 
and revenues for local businesses and governments generated from these additional 
construction activities and workers. Any increase in workforce and revenue, however, would be 
temporary and negligible, lasting only as long as construction. Because the impacts to the 
socioeconomic environment would be negligible, this topic is dismissed. 
Prime and Unique Farmlands  
In August 1980, the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) directed that federal agencies 
must assess the effects of their actions on farmland soils classified by the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture's Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) as prime or unique. Prime or 
unique farmland is defined as soil that particularly produces general crops such as common 
foods, forage, fiber, and oil seed; unique farmland produces specialty crops such as fruits, 
vegetables, and nuts. There are 68 acres of prime and unique agricultural lands in the Fruita 
Valley in the park. These lands are composed of orchards, pastures, and open fields, which are 
part of a National Register-listed cultural landscape. As such, these lands are protected under 
the National Historic Preservation Act, which limits development and use of the district. Neither 
alternative will affect the manner in which these lands are managed. Specifically, the portion of 
the project that passes through the Fruita Rural Historic District orchards will not affect fruit trees 
Capitol Reef National Park 
 
 
20
 
Resurface the 8-Mile Scenic Drive Road Environmental Assessment 
 
 
 
or orchard operation. Because there would be no effects on prime and unique farmlands, this 
topic is dismissed from further analysis in this document. 
Indian Trust Resources  
Secretarial Order 3175 requires that any anticipated impacts to Indian trust resources from a 
proposed project or action by the Department of Interior agencies be explicitly addressed in 
environmental documents. The federal Indian trust responsibility is a legally enforceable 
fiduciary obligation on the part of the United States to protect tribal lands, assets, resources, 
and treaty rights, and it represents a duty to carry out the mandates of federal law with respect 
to Native American and Alaska Native tribes. 
There are no Indian trust resources at Capitol Reef National Park. The lands comprising the 
park are not held in trust by the Secretary of the Interior for the benefit of Indians due to their 
status as Indians. Because there are no Indian trust resources, this topic is dismissed from 
further analysis in this document. 
Environmental Justice  
Executive Order 12898 General Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority 
Populations and Low-Income Populations requires all federal agencies to incorporate 
environmental justice into their missions by identifying and addressing disproportionately high 
and adverse human health or environmental effects of their programs and policies on minorities 
and low-income populations and communities. Because the new administration facility would be 
available for use by all park staff regardless of race or income, and the construction workforces 
would not be hired based on their race or income, the proposed action would not have 
disproportionate health or environmental effects on minorities or low income populations or 
communities. Because there would be no disproportionate effects, this topic is dismissed from 
further analysis in this document. 
Climate Change and Sustainability 
Although climatologists are unsure about the long-term results of global climate change, it is 
clear that the planet is experiencing a warming trend that affects ocean currents, sea levels, 
polar sea ice, and global weather patterns. Although these changes will likely affect winter 
precipitation patterns and amounts in the parks, it would be speculative to predict localized 
changes in temperature, precipitation, or other weather changes, in part because there are 
many variables that are not fully understood and there may be variables not currently defined. 
Therefore, the analyses in this document are based on past and current weather patterns, and 
the effects of future climate changes are not discussed further.

ALTERNATIVES 
During October 2009, an interdisciplinary team of National Park Service and Federal Highway 
Administration employees met for the purpose of discussing the scope of the proposed project 
and developing project alternatives. This meeting resulted in the definition of project objectives 
as described in the Purpose and Need, and a list of alternatives that could potentially meet 
these objectives. An action alternative and the no-action alternative were originally identified for 
this project. A number of options that were considered for the action alternative were dismissed 
from further consideration for various reasons, as described later in this chapter. One action 
alternative and the no-action alternative are carried forward for further evaluation in this 
environmental assessment. A summary table comparing alternative components is presented at 
the end of this chapter. 
Alternatives Carried Forward 
Alternative A – No-Action  
The no-action alternative consists of the park’s ongoing routine of maintenance and repairs. It 
does not imply or direct discontinuing day-to-day maintenance and repairs. The park would 
continue to clear culverts, stabilize slopes, patch potholes, and complete other isolated repairs 
as the need arises. The road would continue to deteriorate, and repair costs would continue to 
escalate. Temporary road closures for repairs would become more frequent. Should the no-
action alternative be selected, the NPS would respond to future needs and conditions without 
major actions or changes in the present course. 
Alternative B – Rehabilitate and Resurface the Scenic Drive (Preferred Alternative) 
The Scenic Drive would be rehabilitated and repaved throughout its 8-mile length between SR-
24 and the Capitol Gorge parking area. The existing roadway width would be maintained, but 
the pavement would be widened at “S-shaped” curves to help prevent vehicles from off-tracking 
onto the shoulders. The roadway would also be widened at its southern end to provide a 
consistent width. The subgrade throughout the length of the Scenic Drive would be excavated 
as needed in spot locations, and replaced with appropriate fill material. From milepost (MP) 
0.00, the intersection with SR-24, to the park fee station at MP 1.70, the existing pavement on 
the Scenic Drive would be pulverized and the roadway would be paved with asphalt concrete. 
Between the fee station and the Capitol Gorge parking area the existing chip-seal pavement 
would be pulverized, and the roadway would be paved with a double chip-seal overlay. Painted 
centerline striping would be applied from the picnic area and campground in the Fruita Historic 
District to the intersection with SR-24. Centerline striping may also be applied at some of the 
sharpest curves, to enhance safety. Rumble strips would be installed at the beginning of the 15-
mile-per-hour speed zone. Minor improvements would be made to the Fruita Campground 
entrance to provide additional width for turning movements into and out of the campground. 
Paved asphalt aprons would be developed and extended into the entrances of Grand Wash and 
the Pleasant Creek Road. 
At locations where drainage ditches are close to and parallel with the road bed, existing stone 
retaining walls would be extended or new walls would be constructed to prevent future erosion. 
The roadside ditch along the east side of the Scenic Drive across from the historic Gifford Barn 
(MP 1.25) would be improved to better accommodate storm flows. Options being considered 
include reconstructing and paving the ditch with a consistent cross section and slope to more 
easily accommodate mechanical maintenance, or retaining the current native soil ditch while 
implementing a schedule of more frequent maintenance. The native soil ditch would be

22
 
Resurface the 8-Mile Scenic Drive Road Environmental Assessment 
 
 
 
reshaped and hardened with compaction as needed. More analysis will be conducted to 
determine the proper solution. Plugged culverts would be cleaned.  
Existing concrete low water crossings would be repaired or replaced in kind as is needed. In 
some drainages where existing culverts have become plugged with soil and rock, the culverts 
would be replaced with low water crossings. Some such culverts would remain in place and be 
permanently plugged, to ensure that they do not deteriorate and collapse beneath the road bed.  
Stone headwalls that have become weakened would be reconditioned, with grout, resin, or new 
mortar applied as needed. Some stone headwalls would be dismantled and reconstructed, 
using the original stone as much as is feasible. Any replacement stone would be native stone of 
a similar appearance. All masonry stone rehabilitation would be in accordance with the 
Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for the Preservation of Historic Properties. Stone riprap 
would be placed at culvert outlets as needed.  
The roadway pavement would be widened on curves between approximately mileposts 4.3 to 
4.5, although the widened pavement would still be on the existing road bench. In other isolated 
locations throughout the length of the Scenic Drive the roadway would be widened by 1 to 2 
feet, to provide a consistent road width as much as is feasible. Warning signs would be installed 
in locations where the roadway narrows, but cannot be widened because of the proximity of 
important park resources. 
Near the Capitol Gorge parking area, from approximately milepost 7.4 to 7.9, the adjacent 
hillside would be cut back to create slopes with gradients of approximately two-to-one or three-
to-one (2:1 or 3:1), depending on conditions at the sites. Drainage ditches would be cut at the 
toe of the slope alongside the roadway. The purpose of those excavations would be to widen 
the road to a consistent width through that stretch of narrow roadway. It is estimated that 
approximately 2,000 to 2,500 cubic yards of shale, shale residuum soils, and sandstone would 
be excavated.  
The parking area at the entrance to Capitol Gorge would be paved with asphalt and the existing 
sandstone curbing would be reset. Some new matching curbing would be installed to formalize 
the parking area. A raised median would be added, and access to the existing restroom would 
be improved. 
Approximately nine minor parking areas and pullouts along the length of the Scenic Drive would 
be reconstructed with formalized layouts. Others would be abandoned and rehabilitated.  
Staging Areas  
Construction staging and stockpile areas for repairing and rehabilitating the Scenic Drive would 
be located in the Cal Pendleton Field south of the Fruita Campground. There is also potential for 
use of the park's "boneyard" for storage of materials and equipment. The access for Cal 
Pendleton Field and the boneyard is by a gravel road immediately south of the Fee Station. Cal 
Pendleton Field is adjacent to the Scenic Drive while the boneyard is approximately one-half 
mile west. Materials for park use are commonly stored at the boneyard now and it has been 
disturbed by park vehicles. It has been used as a construction staging area in the past. Cal 
Pendleton Field is a pasture area but is not currently being used in any capacity by the park. 
 
The parking area at the entrance to Capitol Gorge would also be utilized as a staging area. That 
would provide a staging area at each end of the Scenic Drive.

General Construction Schedule and Costs 
It is anticipated that the repair and rehabilitation of the Scenic Drive would be accomplished in 
2011. The total cost of the repair and rehabilitation of the Scenic Drive would be approximately 
$4 million. 
Mitigation Measures  
The following mitigation measures were developed to minimize the degree and/or severity of 
adverse effects and would be implemented during construction of the action alternative, as 
needed:    
• 
To minimize the amount of ground disturbance, staging and stockpiling areas would be in 
previously disturbed sites, away from visitor use areas to the extent possible. All staging and 
stockpiling areas would be returned to pre-construction conditions following construction.  
• 
Fugitive dust generated by construction would be controlled by spraying water on the 
construction site, if necessary. 
• 
Contractors would be required to properly maintain construction equipment (i.e., mufflers 
and brakes) to minimize noise. Construction equipment would not be permitted to idle for 
long periods of time.  
• 
To minimize possible petrochemical leaks from construction equipment, the contractor would 
regularly monitor and check construction equipment to identify and repair any leaks.  
• 
All tools, equipment, barricades, signs, surplus materials, and rubbish would be removed 
upon project completion. 
• 
Revegetation efforts would strive to reconstruct the natural spacing, abundance, and 
diversity of native plant species using native species. A revegetation plan approved by NPS 
would be developed for disturbances in the project area. 
• 
 All disturbed areas would be restored as much as is feasible to pre-construction conditions 
shortly after construction activities were completed. Weed control methods would be 
implemented to minimize the introduction of noxious weeds. Remedial actions would include 
installation of erosion-control structures, reseeding, topsoil placement, and/or replanting the 
area, and controlling non-native plant species with herbicide. 
• 
Because disturbed soils would be susceptible to erosion, until the soil was stable and 
vegetation was established, standard erosion control measures would be used to minimize 
any potential soil erosion and prevent sediment from reaching streams.  
• 
Treatment of non-native vegetation would be completed in accordance with NPS–13, 
Integrated Pest Management Guidelines. Monitoring and follow-up treatment of exotic 
vegetation would occur after project activities are completed. 
• 
To prevent the introduction of, and minimize the spread of, nonnative vegetation and 
noxious weeds, the following measures would be implemented during construction:  
o Soil disturbance would be minimized. 
o To avoid introduction of non-native/noxious plant species, no hay bales would be 
used for temporary erosion control or during revegetation.  
o All construction equipment would be pressure washed and/or steam cleaned before 
entering the park to ensure that all equipment is weed-free. 
Capitol Reef National Park 
 
 
24
 
Resurface the 8-Mile Scenic Drive Road Environmental Assessment 
 
 
 
o All haul trucks bringing fill materials from outside the park would be covered to 
prevent seed transport. 
o Vehicle and equipment parking would be limited to within construction limits or 
approved staging areas.  
o Staging areas outside the park would be surveyed for noxious weeds and treated 
appropriately prior to use. 
o All fill, rock, and additional topsoil would be obtained from stockpiles from previous 
projects or excess material from this project, if possible; and if not possible, then 
weed-free fill, rock, or additional topsoil would be obtained from sources outside the 
park. NPS personnel would certify that the source is weed-free.  
• 
Erosion control BMPs for drainage and sediment control, as identified and used by the 
FHWA and NPS, would be implemented to prevent or reduce nonpoint source pollution and 
minimize soil loss and sedimentation in drainage areas. These practices may include, but 
would not be limited to, silt fencing, filter fabric, temporary sediment ponds, check dams of 
pea gravel-filled burlap bags or other material, and/or immediate mulching of exposed areas 
to minimize sedimentation and turbidity impacts as a result of construction activities. The 
placement and specific measures used would be dictated to a large degree by the 
steepness of the topography immediately adjacent to the roadway. Silt fencing fabric would 
be inspected daily during project work and weekly after project completion, until removed. 
Accumulated sediments would be removed when the fabric was estimated to be 
approximately 75% full. Silt removal would be accomplished in such a way as to avoid 
introducing sediments into any flowing water bodies. 
• 
Regular site inspections would be conducted to ensure that erosion control measures were 
properly installed and functioning effectively. 
• 
The operation of ground-disturbing equipment would be temporarily suspended during large 
precipitation events to reduce the production of sediment that may be transported to 
streams.  
• 
A National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit would be prepared by 
CFLHD and submitted to the Utah Division of Water Quality prior to commencing any near-
water activities. 
• 
A hazardous spill plan would be required from the contractor prior to the start of construction 
stating what actions would be taken in the case of a spill and preventive measures to be 
implemented. Hazardous spill clean-up materials would be on-site at all times. This measure 
would be designed to avoid/minimize the introduction of chemical contaminants associated 
with machinery (e.g., fuel, oil, and hydraulic fluid) used in project implementation. 
• 
Construction workers and supervisors would be informed about special status species. 
Contract provisions would require the cessation of construction activities if a species was 
discovered in the project area, until park staff re-evaluates the project. This would allow 
modification of the contract for any protection measures determined necessary to protect the 
discovery. 
• 
If there were night construction, lights would be shielded and directed downward to minimize 
the areas impacted by the artificial light, and to avoid light pollution. 
• 
The construction contractor would be required to keep all garbage and food waste contained 
and removed daily from the work site, to avoid attracting wildlife. Construction workers would 
be instructed to remove food scraps and not feed or approach wildlife. 
Capitol Reef National Park 
 
 
25
 
Resurface the 8-Mile Scenic Drive Road Environmental Assessment 
 
 
 
• 
Should construction unearth previously undiscovered cultural resources, work would be 
stopped in the area of any discovery and the park would consult with the state historic 
preservation officer and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, as necessary, 
according to §36 CFR 800.13, Post Review Discoveries. In the unlikely event that human 
remains were discovered during construction, provisions outlined in the Native American 
Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (1990) would be followed. 
• 
The National Park Service would ensure that all contractors and subcontractors were 
informed of the penalties for illegally collecting artifacts or intentionally damaging 
paleontological materials, archeological sites, or historic properties. Contractors and 
subcontractors would also be instructed on procedures to follow in case previously unknown 
paleontological or archeological resources were uncovered during construction.  
• 
To minimize the potential for impacts to park visitors, variations on construction timing may 
be considered. One option would include conducting the majority of the work in the off-
season or shoulder seasons.  
• 
Visitors would be informed in advance of construction activities. 
• 
As much as was feasible, park staff would be posted at construction traffic stops to answer 
visitor questions and provide information during traffic delays. 
• 
Provisions for emergency vehicle access through construction zones would be developed. 
Alternatives Considered and Dismissed 
No action alternatives other than to repair and rehabilitate the Scenic Drive throughout its length 
were considered feasible, but a number of options were considered for the action alternative. 
Options were considered for rehabilitating a ditch at approximately milepost 1.25. The existing 
ditch does not effectively intercept and convey storm flows from the adjacent steep slopes. 
Sediment-laden stormwaters sometimes overflow the ditch, damaging the roadway and flowing 
into the nearby historic Gifford barn. The following options for preventing those flows were 
considered, but were dismissed.  
1. Install a relief culvert halfway down the existing ditch. Although a relief culvert would 
convey a portion of the water under the road, it is likely that the culvert would plug with 
sediment and become inoperative.  
2. Raise the roadway profile . It was determined that raising the roadway profile would not 
be feasible, because the increased cost would not provide a correspondingly higher level 
of protection for the roadway or the barn. The option that was selected as part of the 
preferred alternative (a concrete-lined ditch) would provide equivalent protection for the 
roadway and the barn and would cost appreciably less. 
The option of painting white edge striping (sometimes referred to as a fog line) along the 
outside edge of each travel lane was considered as roadway striping option, but that option 
was dismissed. Park Service and FHWA interdisciplinary team members felt that such 
striping could induce vehicle operators to drive closer to the centerline, actually decreasing 
safety.  
Alternative Summaries 
Table 2 summarizes the major components of Alternatives A and B, and compares the ability of 
these alternatives to meet the project objectives (the objectives for this project are identified in 
the Purpose and Need chapter). As shown in the following table, Alternative B meets each of 
Capitol Reef National Park 
 
 
26
 
Resurface the 8-Mile Scenic Drive Road Environmental Assessment 
 
 
 
the objectives identified for this project, while the No Action Alternative does not address all of 
the objectives. 
Table 2 – Summary of Alternatives and How Each Alternative Meets Project Objectives 
Project Objectives  
Alternative A – No Action 
Alternative B – Preferred Alternative 
Improve the Efficiency of 
Park Operations 
 
The efficiency and cost of park operations 
would improve from better road conditions 
and reduced maintenance requirements. 
The improvements would repair damaged 
areas of road subgrade, correct cross-
slope and drainage issues, repave the 
entire roadway, protect existing retaining 
walls and headwalls and install new walls 
as needed. Damaged low water crossings 
would be replaced in kind, and new low 
water crossings would replace some 
culverts that are completely filled with 
debris.  
Under the No Action Alternative, the 
NPS would not implement road 
rehabilitation or improvements. The 
efficiency of park operations would 
not be improved and maintenance 
requirements and costs would 
increase. Routine road maintenance 
would continue, but the road 
pavement and structural integrity 
would continue to deteriorate, 
requiring increasingly frequent spot 
repairs. Seasonal flows across and 
alongside the roadway would 
continue damaging the roadway and 
increasingly threatening the integrity 
of the road prism and some stone 
masonry drainage structures. The 
need for repairs would increase. 
Provide for Visitor 
Enjoyment and Safety 
Visitor enjoyment and safety would benefit 
from measures to improve the condition of 
the roadway. Upgrades to the road and 
associated structures would make travel by 
vehicles easier and safer. The pavement 
would be widened to a consistent width 
where feasible. Improvements at Fruita 
Campground would increase turning 
widths for entering and exiting the 
campground. 
Visitor enjoyment and safety 
concerns would not be fully 
addressed, because problems with 
the road surface, slope, drainage, 
guard walls, retaining walls, and low 
water crossings would not be 
corrected, except by spot repairs as 
needed. A deteriorating road 
surface and delays during repair 
efforts would adversely affect visitor 
enjoyment. Existing safety concerns 
would remain;  the pavement would 
not be widened to a consistent 
width, and turning widths for 
entering and exiting Fruita 
Campground would not be 
increased.  
Protect Park Resources  
 
Park natural and cultural resources 
and the scenic quality of the road 
would be compromised by 
deteriorating road conditions, poor 
drainage, erosion, and damage to 
historic cultural features. 
Park natural and cultural resources would 
be protected by drainage improvements, 
repair and construction of retaining walls 
and headwalls, and other structural repairs 
that reduce the potential for deterioration 
of historic features. Road repairs and 
improvements would decrease erosion 
along the roadway, reducing adverse 
impacts to vegetation, soils, and water 
quality.

Table 3 summarizes the anticipated environmental impacts for alternatives A and B. Only those 
impact topics that have been carried forward for further analysis are included in this table. The 
Environmental Consequences chapter provides a more detailed explanation of these impacts.  
Table 3 – Environmental Impact Summary by Alternative 
Impact Topic 
Alternative A – No Action 
Alternative B – Preferred Alternative 
Cultural 
Landscapes 
Alternative B would have short-term minor adverse 
impacts to the Scenic Drive and Fruita cultural 
landscapes. The visual impact to individual drainage 
features and the overall landscape settings would be 
apparent during the construction process. In the long 
term, the impacts to these landscapes would be 
beneficial. The condition of the Scenic Drive roadbed 
would be improved, and the road’s historical drainage 
features would be rehabilitated.      
Alternative A would have 
short-term minor, and long-
term minor to moderate 
adverse impacts on both 
the Scenic Drive and Fruita 
cultural landscapes. The 
condition and integrity of 
the Scenic Drive would 
continue to degrade due to 
deferred maintenance and 
the ongoing effects of 
erosion.  
Soundscape 
Alternative A would have 
short-term, moderate, 
adverse impacts on the 
soundscape. Repair 
operations and their short-
term impacts on the 
soundscape would become 
more frequent. 
Alternative B would have short-term, moderate, adverse 
impacts and long-term beneficial impacts on the 
soundscape. The noise levels from road repair 
operations would be very noticeable to visitors and would 
adversely affect wildlife in the surrounding area, but the 
noise would not have an effect on the regional level. 
However, the rehabilitation and resurfacing of the entire 
length of the Scenic Drive would reduce the frequency of 
periodic repairs. Noise associated with such road repairs 
would be correspondingly reduced.  
Geology and 
Soils 
Alternative B would have long-term beneficial impacts on 
geology and soils by reducing erosion, rutting, and soil 
compaction throughout the length of the Scenic Drive. 
There would be long-term minor adverse impacts from 
the removal of rock and soil to accommodate some 
widening of the roadway, the excavation and paving of 
an earthen ditch, and the cleaning, realignment, and 
widening of other ditches along the Scenic Drive, but 
impacts would be predominantly beneficial.  
Alternative A would have 
long-term, minor, adverse 
impacts on geology and 
soils. Erosion would 
continue, because repairs 
and rehabilitation efforts 
would not be completed 
throughout the length of the 
Scenic Drive. 
Health and 
Safety 
Alternative B would have short-term minor adverse 
impacts on health and safety, due to road repair 
operations, as motorists approach and pass through the 
construction area. Alternative B would also have 
beneficial long-term impacts. The correction of existing 
roadway deficiencies and improved safety features would 
increase safety for motorists on the Scenic Drive. 
Alternative A would have 
long-term, minor, adverse 
impacts on health and 
safety. Some repairs would 
have to be deferred, and 
intermittent repairs at 
individual locations in the 
roadway would create 
minor safety hazards for 
park staff and for motorists. 
Visitor Use and 
Experience 
Alternative A would have 
long-term, minor to 
moderate, adverse impacts 
on visitor use and 
experience. Periodic 
maintenance projects would 
require traffic delays at 
Alternative B would have short-term minor to moderate 
adverse impacts, long-term minor adverse impacts, and 
long-term beneficial impacts on visitor use and 
experience. There would be short-term minor adverse 
impacts on visitor use and experience during road repair 
and rehabilitation activities, and long-term minor adverse 
impacts associated with maintenance activities. The 
Capitol Reef National Park

Impact Topic 
Alternative A – No Action 
Alternative B – Preferred Alternative 
Scenic Drive would be closed between Grand Wash and 
the Capitol Gorge parking area for as long as a month, 
creating a short-term moderate adverse impact on visitor 
use and experience. However, rehabilitation and 
resurfacing of the Scenic Drive would also have long-
term beneficial impacts. 
random times and 
locations. Roadway 
conditions would 
deteriorate to the point that 
the quality of the visitor 
experience is diminished 
from a visibly damaged 
road, eroded low water 
crossings, or deterioration 
of other structural features. 
 
Park Operations 
and 
Management 
Alternative A would have 
long-term, moderate, 
adverse impacts on park 
operations and 
management. Continuing 
and increasing operational 
and maintenance demands 
would be readily apparent 
and would have a 
substantial effect on park 
operations and 
management in a manner 
noticeable to staff and the 
public. 
Alternative B would have short- term and long-term, 
minor, adverse impacts, as well as a long-term beneficial 
impact on park operations and management. Planning 
for and assisting in the completion of the repair and 
rehabilitation of the Scenic Drive would require time and 
attention from park staff, which would add to their 
workloads. Travel on the Scenic Drive would be impeded 
during road rehabilitation and resurfacing activities. 
Those impacts would end when construction was 
finished. With the rehabilitation and resurfacing of the 
Scenic Drive completed, maintenance workloads and 
costs would decrease, creating a long-term beneficial 
impact. 
 
Identification of the Environmentally Preferred Alternative 
The environmentally preferred alternative is determined by applying the criteria suggested in the 
National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), which guides the Council on Environmental 
Quality (CEQ). The CEQ provides direction that “[t]he environmentally preferable alternative is 
the alternative that would promote the national environmental policy as expressed as goals in 
NEPA’s §101: 
1. fulfill the responsibilities of each generation as trustee of the environment for succeeding 
generations; 
2. assure for all generations safe, healthful, productive, and esthetically and culturally 
pleasing surroundings; 
3. attain the widest range of beneficial uses of the environment without degradation, risk of 
health or safety, or other undesirable and unintended consequences; 
4. preserve important historic, cultural and natural aspects of our national heritage and 
maintain, wherever possible, an environment that supports diversity and variety of 
individual choice; 
5. achieve a balance between population and resource use that will permit high standards 
of living and a wide sharing of life’s amenities; and 
6. enhance the quality of renewable resources and approach the maximum attainable 
recycling of depletable resources. 
While the no action alternative (alternative A) would preserve existing conditions, it would 
not be considered the environmentally preferred alternative because not rehabilitating the 
Capitol Reef National Park 
 
 
29
 
Resurface the 8-Mile Scenic Drive Road Environmental Assessment 
 
 
 
Scenic Drive, repairing damaged road and drainage problems, and implementing other 
improvements would not meet environmental goals in the same manner as the preferred 
alternative. Alternative A is not the environmentally preferred alternative for the following 
reasons: 1. not rehabilitating the Scenic Drive would not meet the stewardship responsibility 
for protecting park resources (goal 1, as expressed in NEPA’s §101); 2. it would not improve 
road safety or protection of environmental and cultural resources (goals 2, 3, and 4);           
3. damaged road sections would continue to deteriorate and result in increased 
maintenance costs (and would not fully meet goal 3); and 4. there is a higher likelihood of 
road failure, which would result in road closure, making it more difficult for visitors and staff 
to access park facilities (goal 5). Thus, alternative A does not fully meet the provisions of 
NEPA §101 goals 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. 
The NPS determined that the environmentally preferred alternative is the preferred 
alternative (alternative B) because it surpasses alternative A in realizing the full range of 
national environmental policy goals as stated in §101 of NEPA. Alternative B would provide 
the widest range of beneficial uses without degradation, and would reduce risks to health 
and safety because it would provide sustainable vehicular access to the facilities and 
trailheads along the Scenic Drive. Implementing alternative B would best preserve the 
natural and cultural features along the road because it implements structural improvements 
while providing long-term protection of environmental and cultural resources (goals 1 and 4). 
Road improvements would allow for unimpeded access to recreational opportunities and 
regional access (goals 2, 3, and 5). Alternative B provides for the reuse of asphalt in place 
or milled asphalt that could be used on other road projects outside of the project area (goal 
6).

AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT 
 
Detailed information on the natural, cultural, and human resources at Capitol Reef National Park 
may be found in the final general management plan (NPS, 2001). A summary of the resources 
that may be impacted from the proposed project are described below. 
Location and General Description of the Park 
Capitol Reef National Park is located in south-central Utah approximately 225 miles south of 
Salt Lake City. The entrance to the park is on Utah State Road 24 between the towns of Torrey 
and Hanksville. The park was established by Congress as a national monument on August 2, 
1937, to preserve the geologic resources of the area. It was redesignated a national park in 
1971 and increased six times it original size. The park protects Cathedral Valley, ancient sand 
dunes and other objects of scientific interest, and the majority of the Waterpocket Fold. The 
Waterpocket Fold is the largest wrinkle in the earth’s crust (monocline) in North America.  
Approximately 617,208 recreational visitors came to Capitol Reef National Park in 2009. In the 
past 30 years annual visitation has fluctuated between a low of 516,000 in 2002 to a high of 
681,000 in 1999.  
The primary mode of transportation to the park is the private automobile. The park's main 
driving tours include the Scenic Drive and two mainly unpaved, loop tours through the park's 
Cathedral and Waterpocket Districts. The park offers a brochure for a self-guided tour of the 
Scenic Drive with eleven stops that highlight the geologic and historical features of interest in 
the park.  
Ninety-one percent of park visits include the Scenic Drive. Approximately 70,000 vehicles a year 
travel the road, based on a traffic study completed in 2004. The average number of vehicles per 
day traveling along the Scenic Drive is over 200, with the peak in May of over 400 vehicles per 
day.  
Visitor services include a picnic area, three campgrounds and a visitor center. The Fruita 
Campground is developed, and the Cathedral and Cedar Mesa campgrounds are primitive. 
Backcountry camping is available by permit. The most common visitor activities are viewing 
scenery (93%), followed by photography/painting/drawing (78%) and hiking (70%) (Capitol Reef 
National Park Visitor Study, 2008). There are fifteen hiking trails in the park, ranging in degree 
of difficulty from easy to strenuous. Additional recreational opportunities available at the park 
include climbing, biking, horseback riding and camping. Other popular activities consist of 
visiting the historic buildings and fruit picking in the orchards of the Fruita Historic District, a 
Mormon pioneer settlement. Capitol Reef has the largest historic orchards in the National Park 
System, with approximately 2,600 fruit and nut trees.  
Cultural Landscapes 
The Scenic Drive is a narrow, winding historic road that was originally built in 1883 to link the 
new settlement of Junction (later, Fruita) to other nearby settlements. The road followed traces 
of an ancient route used by Native Americans along the western edge of the Waterpocket Fold. 
Portions of the original route have also been known by other names, including the Blue Dugway, 
Capitol Gorge Highway, Reef Road, Monument Road, and old Utah State Route 24. A two-mile 
section of the road is a contributing landscape feature of the Fruita Rural Historic District. The 
NPS also considers the Scenic Drive/Capitol Gorge as a separate component landscape within 
the park that is potentially eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places.

The original route of the Scenic Drive was not highly engineered, and remained little more than 
a simple wagon road until the mid-twentieth century. Between 1938 and1942, workers from a 
Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) sub-camp established in the park completed some 
improvements to the Scenic Drive. A section of the road southeast of the Fremont River Bridge 
was stabilized. Improvements were also completed at the Danish Hill area south of Fruita. Some 
portions of the route were widened from 11 feet to18 feet, and cut slope flattening to improve 
sight distance was also completed.  
It is unclear which drainage features date to the CCC era, and which were constructed earlier 
and simply repaired or rebuilt between 1938 and 1942. The Scenic Drive currently has 64 
culverts and 22 low water crossings. An inventory of culverts completed by park staff in 2009 
identified six that are known or are likely to have been constructed by the CCC, in addition to 
another 31 possible CCC-era drainage features. Historical records also indicate that four 
hundred feet of rock wall was constructed during this period to improve the grade and drainage, 
and stone check dams were placed in eroding ditches.  
By the late 1950s, when the NPS Mission 66 development period was well underway, the park 
initiated planning for the rerouting of State Highway 24. In 1962 the new highway was realigned 
to run east-west along the Fremont River, with portions following the general alignment of the 
historic route. The Old State Route 24 road from Fruita to Capitol Gorge was renamed the 
Scenic Drive, and the section that extended northeast through the gorge was closed. Minor 
alignments were also completed during this period. Park records note the addition of twelve new 
culverts to address drainage problems.  
Over the years, the Scenic Drive was widened to approximately 20 feet, although some areas 
are narrower. The Fremont Bridge was replaced in 1985 and the section of road between Fruita 
and Capitol Gorge, formerly gravel, was chip-sealed in 1988. Gabion walls, at least four low 
water crossings, and pullouts were also constructed. However, despite these alterations, the 
Scenic Drive retains its rustic character.  
Soundscape 
Generally, ambient sound levels in the vicinity of the proposed project are low and are 
dominated by natural sounds. In the project area natural sounds include the sounds of wind, 
running water, birds, and occasionally other animal sounds.  
Vehicle traffic is the main source of human-caused noise in the project area. Although roadway 
speeds are low, visitor traffic intermittently increases noise levels, particularly during the 
summer months when traffic levels are higher. Noise is also produced during road maintenance 
activities. Summer is the busiest season for road maintenance. Because of weather limitations, 
part of the construction work for the proposed project would occur during the summer.  
Actual ambient sound levels along the Scenic Drive are not known, but as a frame of reference, 
the sound level on a totally quiet night in a desert would be around 30 decibels (dBA), while 
sound levels from light traffic on paved roads range from 45 to 50 dBA at a distance of 100 feet 
from the roadway.  
Geology and Soils 
The Scenic Drive follows the western face of the Waterpocket Fold. The geology in the area 
dates from the Permian (as old as 270 million years) to the Cretaceous (around 80 million years 
old). The Waterpocket Fold has tilted the geologic strata down to the east. The older rocks are 
found in the western part of the park, and the younger rocks are found near the east boundary. 
The geology of the area includes the reddish-brown mudstones, siltstones, claystones, and fine 
Capitol Reef National Park

grained sandstones of the Moenkopi Formation and the grayer band of Chinle shale (originally 
deposited as volcanic ash), to the distinctive red, white, and reddish-brown colors and various 
shapes assumed by the sandstones of the Wingate, Navajo, and Kayenta formations.  
Soils in the area of the proposed project are typically very loose, fine-grained, poorly graded 
silty sand, with some gravel and boulders. The soils are derived from the sandstones and 
shales that predominate the geology of the park. Such soils are easily infiltrated and eroded by 
water, and can also become hydro-compacted.  
Heavier soils, such as silty clay loams, can be found at the base of shale slopes and hills 
throughout the project area. Soils along the Fremont River floodplain are derived from alluvium 
deposited by the river. In the Fruita area, silty clay loam floodplain soils were successfully 
farmed, producing alfalfa, sorghum, vegetables, and a variety of fruit orchards. The NPS has 
continued that history of cultivation within the park.  
Health and Safety 
The rustic characteristics of the Scenic Drive make it suited for low volume traffic flow with slow 
travel speeds. This works well for visitors using the road to access park facilities, which include 
the visitor center, a campground, trailheads, and the Fruita Historic District with its homestead 
buildings and orchards. It is a park road only, and is not an element of the local or county traffic 
patterns. However, the volume and types of public use have increased since the establishment 
of the park. The Scenic Drive pre-dates the establishment of the park and was not constructed 
to currently accepted standards for the volume and types of public use the road now receives. 
Health and safety concerns include the narrow road width, tight curves, debris such as rocks in 
the roadway, the possibility of flash flooding in the washes crossed by the road, and seasonal 
heat and cold.  
Collisions between vehicles are not frequent. Park records report two vehicle collisions on the 
Scenic Drive from 1990 through 1993, and two vehicle collisions from 2005 through 2008. The 
causes of the accidents were reported as inattention and speeding, and some were identified as 
sideswipe collisions on S-shaped curves. Sliding off the road and striking debris in the road are 
also identified as causes for accidents on the Scenic Drive. 
Restroom facilities and potable water are located at the visitor center and the headquarters area 
(at the intersection of Highway 24 and the Scenic Drive) and in Fruita Campground. The 
campground is developed  with 71 recreational vehicle (RV) and/or tent sites, each with a picnic 
table and grill but no individual water, sewage, or electrical hook-ups. An RV dump station is 
open during the summer. The campground restrooms are heated and feature potable running 
water and flush toilets, but not showers. There are toilet facilities at the southern end of the 
Scenic drive where it intersects unpaved spur roads into Grand Wash and Capitol Gorge.  
The park coordinates law enforcement and related activities with neighboring counties. Most 
emergency services, such as search and rescue and initial-response emergency medical 
services for incidents within the park, are provided by park staff. Emergency medical response 
staff have offices in the park headquarters. A medical clinic is located in Bicknell, 19 miles west 
of the park on Utah Highway 24. The closest hospital is located in Richfield, 75 miles west of the 
park. There is limited cell phone service in most areas of the park, but park radios work well 
along the Scenic Drive corridor.  
Fire personnel from the park and from other agencies work together to accomplish each 
agency’s fire management goals. Neighboring agencies will provide assistance with emergency 
fire suppression when requested, in accordance with the Annual Operating Plan for Fire

Management between the U.S. Forest Service, the Bureau of Land Management, National Park 
Service, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Bureau of Indian Affairs, and the State of Utah.  
Visitor Use and Experience 
About 665,000 people visited the park in 2009. The average length of stay for visitor groups who 
spend less than 24 hours in the park is about 6 hours. Approximately 92% stop at the visitor 
center and 91% travel the Scenic Drive. The primary visitor activities are driving the Scenic 
Drive, viewing the scenery, and visiting the Fruita Historic District. Besides the paved Scenic 
Drive, there are unpaved loop tours through the Cathedral and Waterpocket Districts of the 
park. 
Hiking is a popular visitor activity. In the Fruita area, there are 15 day-hiking trails with trailheads 
located along Utah Highway 24 and the Scenic Drive. There are also numerous hiking options 
for serious backpackers and those who enjoy exploring remote areas.  
Horse and pack animal use is also permitted in the park along several park roads and trails. 
There are limited overnight facilities for stock users, and backcountry use permits are available 
for backcountry camping with stock. 
The park offers camping in the developed Fruita campground and the nearby group 
campground. There are two primitive campgrounds in more remote parts of the park, and 
backcountry camping is also permitted.  
Rock climbing is becoming increasingly popular in the park, as in Utah’s canyon country in 
general. Bicycling is allowed, though cyclists must stay on designated roads at all times. 
Cyclists may not travel off road, in washes, on closed roads, on hiking trails, or backcountry 
routes. 
From May to September, the park offers a variety of ranger-guided programs at no charge. 
These include guided walks, talks, and evening programs at the campground amphitheater.  
Park Operations and Management 
The park has approximately 24 permanent employees, and additional seasonal employees in 
the summer months. Interns and volunteers augment the paid staff. Personnel resources are 
distributed among the superintendent’s office, administration, interpretation, maintenance, 
resource management and science, and visitor and resource protection functions.  
The park has a visitor center, an administrative headquarters complex, a maintenance building, 
a service yard, and a 15-unit residential area. The Fruita Rural Historic District within the park 
includes a 3,000-tree orchard complex. Many historic buildings within the park, including wood 
frame homes and barns, are used for staff and/or interpretive purposes, The park has 
equipment such as trucks, trailers, and construction equipment to support park operations.  
The 71-site Fruita Campground is the only developed campground in the park, located south of 
the visitor center in the Fruita Historic District. A group campground, available by reservation for 
as many as 40 people, is located near the Fruita Campground. Two no-fee primitive 
campgrounds in more remote parts of the park have pit toilets and picnic tables, but no water. 
The only paved roads within the park are State Road 24 and the Scenic Drive. Unpaved roads 
include the Capitol Gorge and Grand Wash spur roads, South Draw Road, Hartnet Road, 
Caineville Wash Road, Burr Trail Road, and Notom-Bullfrog Road. 
For management purposes the park is divided into six types of zones: primitive, semi-primitive, 
threshold, rural developed, utility corridor, and road corridors.  
Capitol Reef National Park 
 
 
34
 
Resurface the 8-Mile Scenic Drive Road Environmental Assessment 
 
 
 
In the primitive zone, management strategies focus on wilderness qualities, allowing natural 
processes and undeveloped native conditions to continue with minimal human interference. 
Native species are maintained or re-established, and sensitive species are protected or 
augmented. Attempts are made to eliminate non-native species. Some grazing and related 
development is allowed. The primitive zone can be approached via a limited number of roads, 
primarily four-wheel drive roads and high clearance, two-wheel drive dirt roads. Travel through 
this zone requires cross-country hiking or horseback riding on unimproved trails and routes. 
The semi-primitive zone is similar in nature to the primitive zone, except that evidence of human 
activity is more pronounced. Road corridors are more abundant, and human access is easier. 
Grazing and related development is allowed. Maintenance activities should be rare, solely for 
protecting resources and restoring areas disturbed by human activities. The semi-primitive zone 
can be accessed by a number of roads, primarily two-wheel drive dirt roads. Travel through this 
zone requires cross-country hiking or horseback riding on unimproved trails and routes. 
The threshold zone accommodates more varied human activities. Interpretation is provided 
along maintained hiking trails. A moderate degree of resource management is required. Natural 
processes are perpetuated and natural conditions are maintained as much as possible, but 
some human alterations and intrusions are evident. Access is on paved or two-wheel drive, low-
clearance, all-weather roads. Access to the zone interior is along a variety of trails and routes 
that connect various destination points.  
The rural developed zone encompasses the park headquarters, the Fruita campground, and the 
Sleeping Rainbow Ranch developed areas. The zone is moderately developed and it sustains 
the highest level of visitor use. It includes the Fruita Rural Historic District. Also located in the 
zone are the park visitor center, maintenance facilities, and employee housing. Vehicle access 
to and throughout the zone is by paved and unpaved roads suitable for most vehicles. 
Pedestrian access is provided by maintained trails that allow visitors to explore natural and 
cultural environments. Some trail sections are wheelchair-accessible. 
The utility corridor zone contains the permanent physical plant and infrastructure developments 
relating to utilities delivery, such as electricity, irrigation water, and telephone service. Corridor 
widths vary according to right-of-way agreements or special use permits. Visitors can expect to 
encounter power lines, water developments, underground telephone lines, utility junction boxes, 
and other such developments. The natural character of the land is preserved, while 
accommodating utility development and maintenance. Visitor access to the zone varies 
considerably, depending on the terrain. 
Road corridor zones identify all primary, secondary, and four-wheel drive vehicle routes 
established within the park. Bicycles and licensed vehicles manufactured for highway use may 
travel on park roads. Visitors can expect a variety of road conditions, ranging from a paved, 
well-maintained, state highway to minimally maintained, high clearance, variable-width dirt 
roads.  
The Scenic Drive is one of the road corridors in the park. Users can expect a well-maintained, 
hard-surfaced road meandering through the rural cultural landscape and through the threshold 
zone, with turnouts, trailhead parking areas, interpretive signs, wayside exhibits, and picnic 
sites. Routine maintenance activities include filling potholes and depressions, repairing eroded 
shoulders, removing debris from roadway drains, and chip-sealing the roadway as needed.

ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES 
Methodology 
This chapter analyzes the potential environmental consequences, or impacts, that would occur 
as a result of implementing the proposed project. Topics analyzed in this chapter include 
cultural landscapes, soundscape, geology and soils, visitor use and experience, and park 
operations. Direct, indirect, and cumulative effects are analyzed for each resource topic carried 
forward. Natural and cultural resource topics are also analyzed for impairment. Potential 
impacts are described in terms of type, context, duration, and intensity. General definitions are 
defined as follows, while more specific impact thresholds are given for each resource at the 
beginning of each resource section. 
• Type describes the classification of the impact as either beneficial or adverse, direct or 
indirect: 
- Beneficial: A positive change in the condition or appearance of the resource or a change 
that moves the resource toward a desired condition. 
- Adverse: A change that moves the resource away from a desired condition or detracts 
from its appearance or condition. 
- Direct: An effect that is caused by an action and occurs in the same time and place. 
- Indirect: An effect that is caused by an action but is later in time or farther removed in 
distance, but is still reasonably foreseeable. 
• Context describes the area or location in which the impact will occur. Are the effects site-
specific, local, regional, or even broader? 
• Duration describes the length of time an effect will occur, either short-term or long-term: 
- Short-term impacts generally last only during construction, and the resources resume 
their pre-construction conditions following construction. 
- Long-term impacts last beyond the construction period, and the resources may not 
resume their pre-construction conditions for a longer period of time following construction. 
• Intensity describes the degree, level, or strength of an impact. For this analysis, intensity has 
been categorized into negligible, minor, moderate, and major. Because definitions of intensity 
vary by resource topic, intensity definitions are provided separately for each impact topic 
analyzed in this environmental assessment. 
Note: NPS policy requires that direct and indirect impacts be “considered.” However, 
directness is not to be specifically labeled or identified as “direct/indirect” in any of the impact 
topics in the environmental consequences chapter.  
Cumulative Effects 
The Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) regulations, which implement the National 
Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 USC 4321 et seq.), require assessment of cumulative 
impacts in the decision-making process for federal projects. Cumulative impacts are defined as 
"the impact on the environment which results from the incremental impact of the action when 
added to other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions regardless of what 
agency (federal or non-federal) or person undertakes such other actions" (40 CFR 1508.7). 
Cumulative impacts are considered for both the no-action and preferred alternative.  
Capitol Reef National Park 
 
 
36
 
Resurface the 8-Mile Scenic Drive Road Environmental Assessment 
 
 
 
Cumulative impacts were determined by combining the impacts of the preferred alternative with 
other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions. Therefore, it was necessary to 
identify projects at Capitol Reef National Park and, if applicable, the surrounding region. The 
following projects were identified for the purpose of conducting the cumulative effects analysis, 
listed from past to future: 
Erosion control/bank stabilization measures along State Route 24: The NPS and the Utah 
Department of Transportation installed erosion control/bank stabilization measures along State 
Route 24 within Capitol Reef National Park.  
Development of the Sleeping Rainbow Ranch as a research facility: The project included 
demolishing and replacing existing buildings and utilities on a mesa top approximately two miles 
southwest of the Capitol Gorge parking area. Additional facilities were constructed for use as a 
year-round educational site.  
Replace administration trailer with permanent building:  The park is in the process of replacing 
the existing administration offices trailer with a permanent structure. This project will construct a 
new, site-built structure of about 1,650-square feet that will provide replacement office space for 
all of the administrative functions and a small portion of space for functions that are located in 
two other buildings. The existing administrative trailer has been removed. 
Construct drainage structures on Utah SR-24 to return the Fremont River into its natural 
channel: Capitol Reef National Park, in cooperation with the Utah Department of Transportation 
and the Federal Highways Administration, proposes to construct a set of drainage structures on 
Utah State Highway 24 to return the Fremont River into its natural channel. The proposed 
project includes the construction of two bridges, restoration of habitat for the threatened Ute 
ladies’-tresses orchid, elimination of a manmade waterfall, removal of a parking area near the 
waterfall, and returning the Fremont River to its natural course in the oxbow.  
Replace the existing resources trailer and visitor and resources protection (VRP) shack with 
permanent structures: This project would construct a new, site-built structure that would provide 
replacement office space for all of the resources management and VRP functions. The existing 
resources and VRP structures would be removed.  
Unacceptable Impacts   
As described in Purpose and Need, the NPS must prevent any activities that would impair park 
resources and values. The impact threshold at which impairment occurs is not always readily 
apparent. Therefore, the NPS will apply a standard that offers greater assurance that 
impairment will not occur. The NPS will do this by avoiding impacts that it determines to be 
unacceptable. These are impacts that fall short of impairment, but are still not acceptable within 
a particular park’s environment. Park managers must not allow uses that would cause 
unacceptable impacts; they must evaluate existing or proposed uses and determine whether the 
associated impacts on park resources and values are acceptable. Virtually every form of human 
activity that takes place within a park has some degree of effect on park resources or values, 
but that does not mean the impact is unacceptable or that a particular use must be disallowed. 
To determine if unacceptable impact could occur to the resources and values of the parks, the 
impacts of proposed actions in this environmental assessment were evaluated based on 
monitoring information, published research, and professional expertise, and compared to the 
guidance on unacceptable impacts provided in 2006 National Park Service Management Policies 
1.4.7.1 that defines unacceptable impacts as impacts that, individually or cumulatively, would: 
• 
Be inconsistent with a park’s purposes or values, or  
Capitol Reef National Park 
 
 
37
 
Resurface the 8-Mile Scenic Drive Road Environmental Assessment 
 
 
 
• 
Impede the attainment of a park’s desired future conditions for natural and cultural 
resources as identified through the park’s planning process, or  
• 
Create an unsafe or unhealthful environment for visitors or employees, or  
• 
Diminish opportunities for current or future generations to enjoy, learn about, or be inspired 
by park resources or values, or  
• 
Unreasonably interfere with:  
o Park programs or activities, or  
o An appropriate use, or  
o The atmosphere of peace and tranquility, or the natural soundscape maintained in 
wilderness and natural, historic, or commemorative locations within the park.  
o NPS concessioner or contractor operations or services.  
By preventing unacceptable impacts, park managers also ensure that the proposed use of park 
resources will not conflict with the conservation of those resources. In this manner, the park 
managers ensure compliance with the Organic Act’s separate mandate to conserve park 
resources and values.  
Impairment 
2006 National Park Service Management Policies requires analysis of potential effects to 
determine whether or not actions would impair park resources. The fundamental purpose of the 
national park system, established by the Organic Act and reaffirmed by the General Authorities 
Act, as amended, begins with a mandate to conserve park resources and values. National Park 
Service managers must always seek ways to avoid, or to minimize to the greatest degree 
practicable, adversely impacting park resources and values.  
However, the laws do give the National Park Service the management discretion to allow 
impacts to park resources and values when necessary and appropriate to fulfill the purposes of 
a park, as long as the impact does not constitute impairment of the affected resources and 
values. Although Congress has given the National Park Service the management discretion to 
allow certain impacts within park, that discretion is limited by the statutory requirement that the 
National Park Service must leave park resources and values unimpaired, unless a particular law 
directly and specifically provides otherwise. The prohibited impairment is an impact that, in the 
professional judgment of the responsible National Park Service manager, would harm the 
integrity of park resources or values. An impact to any park resource or value may, but does not 
necessarily, constitute an impairment, but an impact would be more likely to constitute an 
impairment when there is a major or severe adverse effect upon a resource or value whose 
conservation is:  
• 
necessary to fulfill specific purposes identified in the establishing legislation or proclamation 
of the park;  
• 
key to the natural or cultural integrity of the park; or  
• 
identified as a goal in the park’s general management plan or other relevant NPS planning 
documents.  
Impairment may result from National Park Service activities in managing the park, visitor 
activities, or activities undertaken by concessioners, contractors, and others operating in the 
park. A determination on impairment is made in the Environmental Consequences section for 
Capitol Reef National Park

natural and cultural resource topics. 
The potential for impairment or unacceptable impacts from the proposed alternatives is provided 
at the end of this analysis of environmental consequences.  
Cultural Landscapes 
Intensity Level Definitions 
The methodology used for assessing impacts is based on how the proposed repairs to the 
Scenic Drive would affect the Scenic Drive and Fruita cultural landscapes. The thresholds for 
this impact assessment are as follows: 
 
Negligible 
Minor 
Moderate 
Major 
Negligible impacts 
would be at the 
lowest levels of 
detection-barely 
perceptible and not 
measurable. There 
would be no change 
to defining features 
that contribute to 
the resource’s 
National Register 
eligibility. 
Impacts would not 
affect the character-
defining features of 
a cultural landscape 
or structure listed or 
eligible for the 
National Register. 
Impacts would be 
detectable but 
would not diminish 
the overall integrity 
of the resource. 
Moderate impacts 
would alter a 
character-defining 
feature(s) of a 
cultural landscape 
and result in 
measurable 
changes, and they 
could diminish the 
overall integrity of 
the resource to the 
extent that its 
National Register 
eligibility would be 
jeopardized.  
Major impacts 
would result from 
substantial and 
highly noticeable 
changes that would 
alter the character-
defining features of 
a cultural 
landscape. These 
impacts would 
diminish the overall 
integrity of the 
resource to the 
extent that it would 
no longer be eligible 
to be listed in the 
National Register. 
Short-term ⎯occurs only during project construction 
Long-term ⎯continues after project construction 
 
Impacts of Alternative A (No-Action Alternative) 
Effects on the Fruita and the Scenic Drive cultural landscapes under the no-action alternative 
would be minor in the short term. In the long-term, impacts would be minor to moderate, and 
adverse. Despite periodic maintenance, the road conditions on the Scenic Drive would continue 
to deteriorate. The integrity of the landscapes would be visibly diminished due to the damaged 
roadbed, eroded low water crossings, and clogged or collapsed stone culverts. The integrity of 
the Scenic Drive, and therefore the settings of both cultural landscapes would be jeopardized 
due to degradation of their character-defining features. This could ultimately impact the National 
Register eligibility of these cultural landscapes.      
Cumulative Effects:  Other actions in the park will have negligible impacts to the park’s cultural 
landscapes. For the erosion control/bank stabilization measures along State Route 24, impacts 
to cultural landscapes are negligible in the short-term and long-term. The development of the 
Sleeping Rainbow Ranch as a research facility had negligible impacts on cultural landscapes. 
Replacing the administration and resources trailers with permanent structures will also have 
negligible impact on cultural landscapes within the park. Constructing drainage structures on 
Capitol Reef National Park 
 
 
39
 
Resurface the 8-Mile Scenic Drive Road Environmental Assessment 
 
 
 
Utah SR-24 to return the Fremont River into its natural channel will have negligible impacts to 
cultural landscapes. The impacts of the past, present, and future actions, in combination with 
the long-term, minor to moderate, adverse impacts of alternative A, would have minor to 
moderate, adverse impacts on visitor cultural landscapes.  
Conclusion:  Alternative A would have short-term minor adverse impacts, and long-term, minor 
to moderate, adverse impacts on cultural landscapes. Cumulative impacts would be minor in the 
short term, minor to moderate in the long term, and adverse.  
Impacts of Alternative B (Preferred Alternative) 
Alternative B would have short-term minor adverse impacts on cultural landscapes during road 
repair and rehabilitation activities. Work on the Scenic Drive roadbed and related drainage 
structures would visibly impact the character-defining features and the landscape setting during 
the construction phase. Periodic road maintenance would continue to impact the cultural 
landscapes of Fruita and the Scenic Drive, but maintenance needs and frequencies would be 
reduced.  
Following construction, the landscape settings and individual character-defining features would 
be improved and would benefit from alternative B. With subgrade improvements, those 
segments of the road that are affected by subsidence or slumping would no longer require 
frequent repairs.  The selective pavement widening of the S-curves at Grand Wash would occur 
within the existing road bench. Stone culverts, headwalls and low-water crossings would 
function properly, and contribute to the integrity of the Scenic Drive and improve the overall 
condition of the Fruita and the Scenic Drive landscapes. The setting, design, feeling and overall 
rustic quality of the Scenic Drive would be maintained. 
Cumulative Effects:  Other actions in the park will have negligible impacts to the park’s cultural 
landscapes. For the erosion control/bank stabilization measures along State Route 24, impacts 
to cultural landscapes are negligible in the short-term and long-term. The development of the 
Sleeping Rainbow Ranch as a research facility had negligible impacts on cultural landscapes. 
Replacing the administration and resources trailers with permanent structures will also have 
negligible impact on cultural landscapes. Constructing drainage structures on Utah SR-24 to 
return the Fremont River into its natural channel will have negligible impacts to cultural 
landscapes. The impacts of the past, present, and future actions, in combination with the short-
term, minor adverse and long term beneficial impacts of alternative B, would have minor 
adverse and beneficial impacts on cultural landscapes.  
Conclusion:  Alternative B would have short-term minor adverse impacts and long-term 
beneficial impacts on cultural landscapes. Cumulative impacts would be short-term, minor, 
adverse, and long-term beneficial.  
Soundscape 
Intensity Level Definitions 
Capitol Reef National Park was established for the benefit and enjoyment of the public. Noise 
can adversely affect those benefits by intruding upon or disrupting experiences of solitude. 
Noise can also indirectly impact resources by interfering with sounds important for animal 
communication, navigation, mating, nurturing, predation, and foraging functions.  
The methodology used to assess noise impacts in this document is consistent with 2006 
National Park Service Management Policies and Director’s Order #47: Soundscape Preservation 
and Noise Management. 
Capitol Reef National Park

Context, time, and intensity together determine the level of impact for an activity. It is usually 
necessary to evaluate all three factors together to determine the level of noise impact. In some 
cases an analysis of one or more factors may indicate one impact level, while an analysis of 
another factor may indicate a different impact level, according to the criteria below. In such 
cases, best professional judgment based on a documented rationale must be used to determine 
which impact level best applies to the situation being evaluated. The thresholds for this impact 
assessment are as follows: 
 
Negligible 
Minor 
Moderate 
Major 
Effects on the 
natural sound 
environment would 
be at the level of 
detection. Changes 
would be so slight 
that they would not 
be of any 
measurable or 
perceptible 
consequence to the 
visitor experience or 
to wildlife. 
Effects on the 
natural sound 
environment would 
be detectable, 
although the effects 
would be localized. 
Impacts would be 
small and of little 
consequence to the 
visitor experience or 
to wildlife. Mitigation 
measures, if 
needed to offset 
adverse effects, 
would be simple 
and successful. 
Effects on the 
natural sound 
environment would 
be obvious and 
have substantial 
consequences for 
the visitor 
experience or for 
wildlife in the 
region. Extensive 
mitigation measures 
would be needed to 
offset any adverse 
effects and success 
would not be 
guaranteed. 
Effects on the 
natural sound 
environment would 
be readily 
detectable and have 
a noticeable effect 
on the visitor 
experience and 
wildlife. The impacts 
would be localized, 
with few if any 
consequences at 
the regional level. 
There would be 
measureable 
impacts on the local

level. Mitigation 
measures, if 
needed to offset 
adverse effects, 
would be extensive 
and likely 
successful. 
 
Short-term - occurs only during the construction period 
Long-term - occurs even after the construction period  
 
 
Impacts of Alternative A (No-Action Alternative) 
 
The no-action alternative would have recurrent, short-term, moderate, adverse impacts on the 
soundscape. Alternative A would maintain the existing circumstances, in which park staff would 
continue to clear culverts and roadside drainage ditches, stabilize slopes, patch potholes, and 
complete other isolated repairs as the need arose. Surface flows would continue to adversely 
affect the road in some locations, and pavement damage from poor subsurface drainage in 
some locations would require intermittent repairs. The road would continue to deteriorate, and 
repair operations and their short-term impacts on the soundscape would become more frequent.  
Typical sound levels from road construction equipment such as trucks, front loaders, pavers, 
dozers, and graders can be in the range of 63 to 94 dBA at a distance of 100 feet from the 
sound source. Sound levels from light traffic on paved roads range from 45 to 50 dBA at a

distance of 100 feet from the roadway, and the sound level on a totally quiet night in a desert 
would be around 30 decibels (dBA). 
Noise levels decrease at a rate of approximately 6 dBA per doubling of distance from a noise 
source. For example, if a sound level were 94 dBA at 100 feet, it would be 88 dBA at 200 feet, 
and 82 dBA at 400 feet. The rate of decrease is also dependent upon topography and weather 
conditions, but it is likely that within a mile of the roadway the sound from road repair operations 
would be greater than the intermittent sounds created by visitors traveling the Scenic Drive. 
Such sound levels would have a noticeable effect on the visitor experience, disrupting the 
normally tranquil setting, and on wildlife, impelling some animals to leave or avoid the area.  
Cumulative Effects:   Impacts to the soundscape were minor and adverse in the short-term 
during erosion control/bank stabilization measures along State Route 24. Noise from traffic 
(e.g., heavy equipment, propane trucks, and vans) occurred during the development of the 
Sleeping Rainbow Ranch as a research facility, creating short-term, moderate, adverse impacts. 
Noise from outdoor lectures, research activities, and general operations at the research facility 
now carries to the Pleasant Valley floor, creating long-term, minor, adverse impacts on the 
soundscape. The work required to replace the existing administration trailer creates short-term, 
minor, adverse impacts on the soundscape, and replacing the resources trailer will have similar 
adverse impacts. It is anticipated that constructing drainage structures on Utah SR-24 to return 
the Fremont River into its natural channel will have short-term, minor, adverse impacts on the 
soundscape. Those impacts on the soundscape, in combination with the short-term, moderate, 
adverse impacts of the no action alternative, would have short-term, moderate, adverse, 
cumulative impacts and long-term, minor, adverse, cumulative impacts on the soundscape.  
Conclusion:  The no-action alternative would have short-term, moderate, adverse impacts on 
the soundscape. Cumulative impacts would be short-term, moderate, adverse, and long-term, 
minor, adverse.   
Impacts of Alternative B (Preferred Alternative) 
The preferred alternative would have short-term, moderate, adverse impacts and long-term 
beneficial impacts on the soundscape. The noise levels from road repair operations would be 
very noticeable to visitors and would adversely affect wildlife in the surrounding area, but the 
noise would not have an effect on the regional level. However, the rehabilitation and resurfacing 
of the entire length of the Scenic Drive would reduce the frequency of periodic repairs. With 
erosion and slumping of the road shoulders repaired, drainage deficiencies and subgrade 
deficiencies remedied, and repaving of the road with asphalt concrete or chip-sealing, the need 
for future repairs would be reduced. Noise associated with such road repairs would be 
correspondingly reduced.  
 Cumulative Effects:   The cumulative impacts on the soundscape from past, present, and future 
actions (as discussed above in alternative A), in combination with the short-term, moderate, 
adverse impacts and long-term beneficial impacts of the preferred alternative, would have short-
term, moderate, adverse, and long-term beneficial cumulative impacts. 
Conclusion:  The preferred alternative would have short-term, moderate, adverse impacts and 
long-term beneficial impacts on the soundscape. Cumulative impacts would be short-term, 
moderate, adverse, and long-term beneficial.

Geology and Soils 
Intensity Level Definitions 
The planning team based the impact analysis and the conclusions for possible impacts to 
geology and soils on the on-site inspection of known and potential resources within the project 
areas. Where possible, map locations of geological and soils resources were compared with 
locations of potential areas of impact by the proposed project. The thresholds of change for the 
intensity of an impact are defined as follows: 
 
Negligible 
Minor 
Moderate 
Major 
The action would 
result in a change to 
geology or soils, but 
the change would be 
so small that it would 
barely be of any 
measurable or 
perceptible 
consequence 
The action would 
result in a change to 
geology or soils, but 
the change would be 
small and localized 
and of little 
consequence. 
Mitigation may be 
needed to offset 
adverse effects to 
soils, but they would 
be simple to 
implement and 
would likely be 
successful. 
The action could 
result in a change to 
geology or soils; the 
change would be 
measurable and of 
consequence. The 
effect on soil would 
be readily apparent 
and would result in a 
change to the soil 
character over a 
relatively wide area. 
Mitigation measures 
would be needed to 
offset adverse 
effects and would 
likely be successful. 
An action that would 
result in a noticeable 
change to geology or 
soils; the change 
would be 
measurable and 
result in a severely 
adverse impact. The 
action would 
substantially change 
the character of the 
soils over a large 
area in and out of 
the park. Mitigation 
measures would be 
needed and would 
be extensive, and 
their success could 
not be guaranteed. 
 
Short-term: There are no short-term impacts to geological resources. Soils would recover in less 
than 3 years. 
Long-term: All impacts to geological resources would be long-term. It would take more than 3 
years to recover from impacts to soils. 
Impacts of Alternative A (No-Action Alternative) 
Alternative A would have long-term, minor, adverse impacts on geology and soils because 
repairs and rehabilitation efforts would not be completed throughout the length of the Scenic 
Drive. Seasonal high water flows in the drainages would sometimes exceed the carrying 
capacity of culverts and would plug others. The storm waters would be forced from their 
channels, eroding geologic resources and soils as they find a new flow pathway. Erosion and 
development of scour holes would continue below culvert outfalls if rock armoring were not 
installed.  
Vehicle pull-outs would not be formalized and rehabilitated throughout the length of the Scenic 
Drive. Visitors would continue to use informal pull-outs, causing erosion, rutting, and 
compaction. 
Cumulative Effects:  Impacts to soils from erosion control/bank stabilization measures along 
State Route 24 were negligible and adverse in the short-term and beneficial in the long-term. 
Impacts on soils from the development of the Sleeping Rainbow Ranch as a research facility

resulted in a net beneficial effect. Replacement of administrative and research trailers with 
permanent structures will have negligible, long-term, adverse impacts on geology and soils. 
Returning the Fremont River to its natural channel will have long-term beneficial impacts on 
geology and soils. The long-term beneficial impacts of past, present, and future actions, in 
combination with the long-term, minor, adverse impacts of the no action alternative, would have 
long-term beneficial cumulative impacts on geology and soils.  
Conclusion: Alternative A would have long-term, minor, adverse impacts on geology and soils. 
Cumulative impacts would be long-term beneficial.  
Impacts of Alternative B (Preferred Alternative) 
Alternative B would have long-term beneficial impacts on geology and soils by reducing erosion, 
rutting, and soil compaction throughout the length of the Scenic Drive. Drainage culverts would 
be replaced and cleaned as needed to better convey runoff flows and prevent erosion. Stone 
armoring would be placed in drainages as needed to prevent erosion and the development of 
scour holes below culvert outfalls. Vehicle pull-outs would be formalized and rehabilitated 
throughout the length of the Scenic Drive. Other informal pull-outs would be closed, rehabilitated 
and revegetated as needed to reduce and prevent erosion, rutting, and compaction along the 
Scenic Drive. 
Alternative B would create some long-term minor adverse impacts on geology and soils from 
widening of the travel lanes and excavation of ditches. Near the Capitol Gorge parking area, 
from approximately milepost 7.4 to 7.9, the adjacent hillside would be cut back to create 2:1 to 
3:1 slopes. Drainage ditches would be cut at the toe of the slope alongside the roadway. The 
roadway would be widened only slightly, if at all. It is estimated that approximately 2,000 to 
2,500 cubic yards of shale, shale residuum soils, and sandstone would be excavated.  
The subgrade throughout the 8-mile length of the Scenic Drive would be excavated as needed 
in spot locations, and replaced with appropriate fill material. In isolated locations throughout the 
length of the Scenic Drive the roadway would be widened by 1 to 2 feet, to provide a consistent 
road width as much as is feasible. 
An existing earthen ditch at approximately milepost 1.25, south of the Gifford barn, would be 
improved to better convey sediment-laden runoff. Options being considered include 
reconstructing and paving the ditch with a consistent cross section and slope to more easily 
accommodate mechanical maintenance, or retaining the current native soil ditch while 
implementing a schedule of more frequent maintenance. The native soil ditch would be 
reshaped and hardened with compaction as needed. More analysis will be conducted to 
determine the proper solution. Other ditches throughout the length of the Scenic Drive would be 
cleaned, realigned, and widened as necessary to properly convey runoff.  
There would be more beneficial impacts from the reduction of erosion, rutting and compaction, 
than adverse impacts, and overall, the impacts of alternative B on geology and soils would be 
long-term beneficial. 
Cumulative Impacts: The negligible, adverse short-term and long-term impacts and the long-
term beneficial impacts from past, present, and future actions (as discussed above in alternative 
A), in combination with the long-term beneficial impacts of alternative B, would have long-term 
beneficial cumulative impacts on geology and soils. 
Conclusion: Alternative B would have long-term beneficial impacts on geology and soils. 
Cumulative impacts would be long-term beneficial.

Short-term: Impacts that occur during active construction and reclamation activities.  
Long-term: Impacts that occur after construction and related activities are completed. 
Impacts of Alternative A (No-Action Alternative) 
Alternative A would have long-term, minor, adverse impacts on health and safety. Repairs 
would not be completed concurrently throughout the length of the Scenic Drive. Road repairs 
needed to protect health and safety would be completed as promptly as funding and staffing 
levels allowed, but some repairs would have to be deferred. Intermittent repairs at individual 
locations in the roadway would create minor safety hazards for the park staff completing the 
repairs and for the motorists who encountered the work site. 
Examples of such necessary repairs include worn pavement with ruts in some locations, eroding 
road shoulders, drainage ditches where retaining walls are needed to prevent erosion of the 
road bed, plugged or undersized culverts that create drainage and erosion problems that can 
damage the road surface, and eroded low water crossings. Repairs needed for stone masonry 
drain headwalls would be delayed. Additionally, the no-action alternative would not correct the 
areas with inconsistent road widths. The safety hazards associated with such road conditions 
would be noticeable, but would not be substantial except in cases of excessive speed or driver 
inattention.  
 Cumulative Impacts: Construction efforts associated with the past, present, and future actions 
of the erosion control/bank stabilization measures along State Route 24, the development of the 
Sleeping Rainbow Ranch as a research facility, the replacement of the administration trailer and 
the resources trailer with permanent buildings, and the construction of drainage structures on 
Utah SR-24 to return the Fremont River into its natural channel all have created or would create

short-term, minor, adverse impacts on health and safety. Construction of permanent 
administration and resource buildings will have a long-term beneficial impact on health and 
safety, because of the potential for hantavirus infection by staff and visitors in the existing 
trailers. The impacts of the past, present, and future actions in combination with the impacts of 
the no-action alternative would have long-term, minor, adverse, cumulative impacts on health 
and safety.  
Conclusion: Alternative A would have long-term, minor, adverse impacts on health and safety. 
Cumulative impacts would be long-term, minor, adverse.  
Impacts of Alternative B (Preferred Alternative) 
Alternative B would have short-term minor adverse impacts on health and safety. The adverse 
impacts would occur due to road repair operations, as motorists approach and pass through the 
construction area. The adverse impacts would be limited to the construction period. During 
construction, a traffic control plan would be implemented to provide visitors with safe driving 
conditions during construction. The traffic control plan would include temporary closing of lanes, 
sequencing of construction events to minimize impacts to traffic, and restricting contractor work. 
Visitors would be notified of changes in traffic patterns, detours, and traffic delays through the 
use of signs and public notifications. The Scenic Drive would be completely closed for as much 
as a month between Grand Wash and the Capitol Gorge parking area, but it would remain 
passable by administrative and emergency vehicles. All of these actions would be designed to 
reduce short-term impacts on safety. Routine road maintenance would continue to impact health 
and safety with noise, delays, and diminished visual quality, but maintenance needs and 
frequencies would be reduced. With these measures, there would be a minor short-term 
adverse impact on safety from changes in traffic patterns, construction activities, and continuing 
routine maintenance on the Scenic Drive.  
The correction of existing roadway deficiencies and improved safety features would increase 
safety for motorists on the Scenic Drive. The long-term impacts would be beneficial. The rustic 
character of the road would be retained, but visitors would be able to drive more safely on the 
newly surfaced roadway and repaired low water crossings. The improved turning width at the 
Fruita Campground would provide a safer traffic flow through there.  
Cumulative Impacts: The effects of other past, present, and future actions (as discussed above 
in alternative A) would have short-term, minor, adverse impacts and long-term beneficial 
impacts on health and safety. Those actions, in combination with the short-term minor adverse 
impacts and beneficial long-term impacts of alternative B, would have short-term minor adverse 
impacts and beneficial long-term cumulative impacts on health and safety.  
Conclusion: Alternative B would have short-term minor adverse impacts and beneficial long-
term impacts on health and safety. Cumulative impacts would be short-term, minor, adverse and 
long-term beneficial.  
 
Visitor Use and Experience 
Intensity Level Definitions 
Capitol Reef National Park was established in 1937 for the benefit and enjoyment of the public. 
The methodology used for assessing impacts to visitor use and experience is based on how the 
proposed repairs to the Scenic Drive would affect the visitor experience. The thresholds for this 
impact assessment are as follows:

and would likely 
express a strong 
opinion about the 
changes. 
 
Short-term: Impact occurs only during project construction 
Long-term: Impact continues after project construction 
Impacts of Alternative A (No-Action Alternative) 
Effects on the visitor and recreation experience under the no-action alternative would be long-
term, minor to moderate, and adverse. The road would remain open and visitors would continue 
to have access to park resources, but as roadway conditions continued to deteriorate, periodic 
maintenance projects would require traffic delays at random times and locations, 
inconveniencing visitors. Roadway conditions would deteriorate to the point that the quality of 
the visitor experience is diminished from a visibly damaged road, eroded low water crossings, or 
deterioration of other structural features.  
Driving and recreational experiences such as bike riding would decline due to the poor condition 
of the road surface. Road noise and associated activities during maintenance and repair would 
likely cause wildlife to avoid the construction areas, reducing visitors’ opportunities for wildlife 
viewing near the road. Those effects would be noticed by visitors, but the effects would be 
slight. Effects on the visitor and recreation experience would be long-term, minor, and adverse. 
As more of the road surface continued to deteriorate, there would be a long-term, moderate, 
adverse effect on visitor use and experience. Visitors would need to focus more on driving, thus 
limiting their ability to experience the park’s scenery and wildlife. The continued deterioration 
and increased frequency of maintenance and repairs would convey the impression that the park 
is poorly maintained, thus diminishing the overall park experience. Visitors would be aware of 
the effects associated with the deteriorating roadway and would be likely to express an opinion 
about the conditions. The effects on the visitor and recreation experience would be long-term, 
moderate, and adverse.  
Cumulative Effects:  For the erosion control/bank stabilization measures along State Route 24, 
impacts to visitor use and experience were minor and adverse in the short-term, and beneficial 
in the long-term. The development of the Sleeping Rainbow Ranch as a research facility had 
minor, adverse, long and short-term impacts to visitor use and experience. Replacing the 
administration and resources trailers with permanent structures will have a long-term beneficial

impact on visitor use and experience. Constructing drainage structures on Utah SR-24 to return 
the Fremont River into its natural channel will have moderate adverse impacts in the short-term, 
and beneficial impacts in the long-term. The impacts of the past, present, and future actions, in 
combination with the long-term, minor to moderate, adverse impacts of alternative A, would 
have long-term and short-term, moderate, adverse impacts on visitor use and experience.  
Conclusion:  Alternative A would have long-term, minor to moderate, adverse impacts, on visitor 
use and experience. Cumulative impacts would be long-term and short-term, moderate, 
adverse.  
Impacts of Alternative B (Preferred Alternative) 
Alternative B would have short-term minor adverse impacts on visitor use and experience during 
road repair and rehabilitation activities, and it would have long-term minor adverse impacts 
associated with maintenance activities. However, rehabilitation and resurfacing of the Scenic 
Drive would also have long-term beneficial impacts on visitor use and experience.  
Most of the adverse impacts to visitor use would occur during rehabilitation and resurfacing 
operations, and would be limited to the construction period. Construction along the roadway 
would result in minor adverse impacts on visitor use by causing increased levels of noise and 
dust, diminished visual quality, and delays in traveling the length of the road. Noise and other 
associated activities would likely cause wildlife to avoid the construction areas, reducing visitors’ 
opportunities for wildlife viewing near the road. Construction would also adversely impact noise 
levels and the visual experience in the surrounding countryside. Those short- term adverse 
impacts would be noticeable to visitors, but their effect would be slight.  
Construction would likely require that the Scenic Drive would be closed between Grand Wash 
and the Capitol Gorge parking area for as long as a month, creating a short-term moderate 
adverse impact on visitor use and experience. Visitors would be very aware of the impact, and 
would likely express an opinion about it. 
Road maintenance would continue to impact visitor use and experience with noise, delays, and 
diminished visual quality, but maintenance needs and frequencies would be reduced. Use of 
stone retaining walls to prevent erosion near the roadway would create a long-term adverse 
impact to visual quality, by introducing a new and unnatural visual element. The combination of 
intermittent road maintenance activities, combined with the addition of some new retaining walls 
would create a minor long-term adverse impact to visitor use and experience. 
Following construction, the visitor experience would be improved and would benefit from 
alternative B. Access throughout the length of the Scenic Drive would be improved, because it 
would be fully paved with asphalt pavement or chip-seal. With subgrade improvements, those 
segments of the road that are affected by subsidence or slumping would no longer require 
frequent repairs. Visitors would be able to drive comfortably on the newly surfaced roadway, 
with increased opportunities to view scenery and wildlife, with less need to focus on road 
conditions. Paving the parking area at Capitol Gorge would eliminate rutting and the uneven 
surface there. Access to the comfort station at that parking area would also be improved. 
Cumulative Effects:  The effects of other past, present, and future actions (as discussed above 
in alternative A) would have short-term minor to moderate, adverse impacts, long-term, minor, 
adverse impacts on visitor use and experience, but they have long-term beneficial impacts. 
Alternative B would add a slight increment to the short-term, moderate, adverse impacts, and 
long-term beneficial cumulative impacts on visitor use and experience.

Conclusion:   
Alternative B would have short-term minor to moderate adverse impacts, long-term minor 
adverse impacts, and long-term beneficial impacts on visitor use and experience. Cumulative 
impacts would be short-term, moderate, adverse, and long-term beneficial.  
Park Operations and Management 
Intensity Level Definitions 
Implementation of a project can affect the operations of a park such as the number of 
employees needed; the type of duties that need to be conducted; when/who would conduct 
these duties; how activities should be conducted; and administrative procedures. For the 
purpose of this analysis, the human health and safety of park employees is also evaluated. The 
methodology used to assess potential changes to park operations and management are defined 
as follows:   
 
Negligible 
Minor 
Moderate 
Major 
The effects would 
be at low levels of

Short-term: Impact occurs only during project construction 
Long-term: Impact continues after project construction 
Impacts of Alternative A (No-Action Alternative) 
Alternative A would have a long-term moderate adverse impact on park operations and 
management. The effects of the continuing and increasing operational and maintenance 
demands would be readily apparent and would have a substantial effect on park operations and 
management in a manner noticeable to staff and the public. The alternative would maintain the 
existing circumstances in which park staff would continue to clear culverts, stabilize slopes, 
Capitol Reef National Park 
 
 
49
 
Resurface the 8-Mile Scenic Drive Road Environmental Assessment 
 
 
 
patch potholes, repair low water crossings, and complete other isolated repairs as the need 
arises. Subsurface flows would continue to adversely affect the road subgrade in some 
locations. Seasonal surface flows across the road would continue to cause intermittent damage 
to the pavement. 
 The road would continue to deteriorate, and repair costs would continue to escalate. The repair 
efforts needed to offset those adverse effects would likely be successful, but the frequency of 
those efforts would increase. Temporary road closures for repairs would become more frequent. 
Staff time required for roadway maintenance of culverts, shoulders, and other road features 
would increase.  
Cumulative Effects:  Development of the Sleeping Rainbow Ranch as a research facility has 
resulted in a long-term, moderate, adverse impact upon park operations. Replacing the 
administration and resources trailers with permanent structures would have a long-term 
beneficial impact on park operations. Constructing drainage structures on Utah SR-24 to return 
the Fremont River into its natural channel would have no impact on park operations. The effects 
of those past, present, and future actions, in combination with the long-term, moderate, adverse 
impacts of the no-action alternative, would have a long-term, moderate, adverse cumulative 
impact on park operations and management. 
Conclusion:  Alternative A would have long-term, moderate, adverse impacts on park operations 
and management. Cumulative impacts would be long-term, moderate, and adverse.  
Impacts of Alternative B (Preferred Alternative) 
Alternative B would have a short-term, minor, adverse impact and a long-term, minor, adverse 
impact, as well as a long-term beneficial impact on park operations and management. The 
process of planning for and assisting in the completion of the repair and rehabilitation of the 
Scenic Drive would require time and attention from park staff, which would add to their 
workloads. Travel on the Scenic Drive would be impeded during road rehabilitation and 
resurfacing activities. Those impacts would end when construction was finished. Those minor 
short-term impacts would be detectable, but would not have an appreciable effect on park 
operations and management.  
If the rehabilitation and resurfacing of the Scenic Drive proposed in alternative B were 
completed, maintenance workloads and costs would decrease, creating a long-term beneficial 
impact. A newly paved roadway would require fewer periodic repairs; there would be no 
unpaved segments of roadway to maintain. Damage caused by subsurface seepage in the 
roadway subgrade and seasonal flows across the road pavement would be eliminated.  
Cumulative Effects The effects of other past, present, and future actions (as discussed above in 
alternative A) would have long-term, moderate, adverse and long-term beneficial impacts on 
park operations and management. The long-term beneficial impacts and short-term and long-
term, minor, adverse impacts of alternative B would add a small increment to the long-term, 
moderate, adverse cumulative impacts on visitor use and experience.  
Conclusion:  Alternative B would have short- term and long-term, minor, adverse impacts, as 
well as a long-term beneficial impact on park operations and management. Cumulative impacts 
would be long-term, moderate, and adverse. 
Unacceptable Impacts and Impairment 
Unacceptable impacts are those that fall short of impairment, but are still not acceptable within a 
particular park’s environment. Neither alternative creates unacceptable impacts. Both 
alternatives are consistent with the park’s purposes and values. The park was established for 
Capitol Reef National Park 
 
 
50

resource protection and visitor enjoyment and both alternatives protect resources to the 
maximum extent possible and provide opportunities for visitor enjoyment. Neither alternative 
impedes the attainment of the parks’ desired future conditions as this project is consistent with 
previous planning efforts.   
Under either alternative, visitors and employees would continue to have opportunities to enjoy, 
learn about, or be inspired by park resources and values in a safe and healthful environment. 
Both alternatives provide for the resurfacing and repair of the Scenic Drive in ways that do not 
unreasonably interfere with park programs, an appropriate use, the natural atmosphere, or 
concessioner activities.  
As described at the beginning of this discussion of Environmental Consequences, the NPS’ 
threshold for considering whether there could be an impairment is based on major (or 
significant) effects. The analysis of effects on cultural landscapes, soundscape, geology and 
soils, health and safety, visitor use and experience, and park operations and management 
determined that there would be no major adverse effects under either alternative; adverse 
effects were analyzed as negligible to moderate. Guided by this analysis and the 
superintendent’s professional judgment, there would be no impairment of park resources and 
values from implementation of either alternative.

CONSULTATION AND COORDINATION 
Internal Scoping  
Internal scoping was conducted by an interdisciplinary team of professionals from Capitol Reef 
National Park, Intermountain Region Office, the DSC, and CFLHD. Interdisciplinary team 
members met at the park on February 10 and 11, 2009, to discuss the purpose and need for the 
project; existing conditions, and potential alternatives. An environmental screening form was 
completed by park staff in May 2009 to consider potential effects on park resources and to 
identify the appropriate NEPA document for analyzing those potential effects. The appropriate 
NEPA document was identified as an EA. On October 20, 2009 staff from the park, DSC, and 
CFLHD reviewed conditions along the Scenic Drive again, to consider repair and rehabilitation 
procedures, potential environmental impacts, and possible mitigation measures. The team also 
considered past, present, and reasonably foreseeable projects that may have cumulative 
effects, gathered background information, and discussed public outreach for the project.  
Agency Consultation 
In accordance with the Endangered Species Act, the National Park Service contacted the U.S. 
Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) with regards to federally listed special status species. The 
USFWS concurred with the NPS opinion that the proposed project is not likely to adversely 
affect any protected species, and is not likely to adversely modify critical habitat of the Mexican 
spotted owl. The NPS consultation letter and the USFWS concurrence are included in Appendix 
A of this EA.  
In accordance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act, the NPS provided the 
Utah SHPO an opportunity to comment on the effects of this project through submittal of 
separate documentation. A consultation letter was sent to the SHPO by the park on January 22, 
2010. On January 28, the SHPO concurred that sites that are eligible for listing in the National 
Register of Historic Places would not be adversely affected by the proposed project. The 
consultation letter with signed concurrence by the SHPO is included as Appendix B of this EA.

As the nation’s principal conservation agency, the Department of the Interior has the responsibility for 
most of our nationally owned public lands and natural resources. This includes fostering sound use of 
our land and water resources; protecting our fish, wildlife, and biological diversity; preserving the 
environmental and cultural values of our national parks and historic places; and providing for the 
enjoyment of life through outdoor recreation. The department assesses our energy and mineral 
resources and works to ensure that their development is in the best interests of all our people by 
encouraging stewardship and citizen participation in their care. The department also has a major 
responsibility for Native American reservation communities and for people who live in island territories 
under U.S. Administration.
