Progress Towards Meeting District Goals
1999-00 Goals
Progress
Develop curriculum that reflects the state 
standards, benchmarks, and objectives in 
the core subject matter areas and articulate 
said curriculum in grades K-12.

Math, language arts, science, social studies, 
and health teachers have reviewed the state 
of Idaho’s standards and have identified the 
courses within which the standards will be 
addressed.  Teachers in other “elective” 
areas have also identified which standards 
can be addressed within their disciplines.  
Elementary and secondary teachers have 
reviewed the curriculum at each grade level 
and have determined what has to be taught 
at said grade level in order for students to 
make progress needed to meet standards 
when they exit the school system 
 
Develop and review standardized and 
criterion referenced assessments that reflect 
student performance in the core subject 
matter areas, particularly reading and math, 
and develop strategies that will address 
student needs illustrated via the 
assessments.

Our teachers and administrators have 
reviewed the results produced by our own 
summative assessments in math, language, 
science, and social students, the results of 
the IRI and STAR reading assessments, 
and the ITBS and DWA/DMA results.  
They have subsequently developed 
strategies and interventions that addressed 
student deficiencies identified in the 
assessments.  Teachers in our district have 
also developed summative assessments in 
elective areas for grades K-12, and are 
using said assessments to guide subsequent 
instruction. 
 
Increase student achievement by the 
successful completion of goals one and 
two; i.e., by focusing upon the results 
produced by various standardized and 
criterion referenced assessments and 
implementing corrective instructional 
strategies.
