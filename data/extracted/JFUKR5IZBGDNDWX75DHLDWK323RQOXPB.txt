The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) uses the performance assessment (PA) methodology 
described in Chapter 6.0 to demonstrate that the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) disposal 
system will meet the environmental performance standards of Title 40 of the Code of Federal 
Regulations (CFR) Part 191 Subparts B and C.  In order to effectively use PA, three inputs are 
necessary: What can happen to the disposal system? What are the chances of it happening? What 
are the consequences if it happens? The answers to these questions are derived from many 
sources, including field studies, laboratory evaluations, experiments, and, in the case of some 
features not amenable to direct characterization, professional judgment.  The information used in 
PA is described in terms of features of the disposal system that can be used to describe its 
isolation capability, events that can affect the disposal system, and processes that are reasonably 
expected to act on the disposal system.

The DOE selected the Los Medaños region and present site for the WIPP based on certain 
defined siting criteria.  The site selection process, which was focused on sites that contained 
certain favorable features while other unfavorable features were excluded, was applied by the 
DOE with the intent of finding the area that best met the siting criteria.  The siting process is 
discussed in CCA Appendix GCR.  Chapters 3.0, 4.0, and 6.0 and several appendices provide 
additional information supporting this chapter.

Conceptual models of the WIPP disposal system simulate the interaction between the natural 
environment (described in this chapter), the engineered structures (described in Chapter 3.0) and 
the waste (described in Chapter 4.0).  One starting point in developing conceptual models of the 
WIPP disposal system is an understanding of the natural characteristics of the site and of the 
region around the site.  Site characterization and model development is an interactive process 
that the DOE has used for many years.  Basic site information leads to initial models.  Initial 
model sensitivity studies indicate the need for more detailed information.  More site 
characterization then leads to improved models.  In addition, an assessment of the impacts of 
uncertainty inherent in the parameters used to numerically simulate geological features and 
processes has also led the DOE to conduct more in-depth investigations of the natural system.  
These investigations generally proceeded until uncertainty was sufficiently reduced or to the 
point where no further information could be reasonably obtained.

The discussion of conceptual models and initial and boundary conditions is in Section 6.4 and 
Appendix PA, Attachment MASS.  Conceptual models implement scenarios about the future.  
Scenario development is discussed in Section 6.3.  Scenario development requires as inputs 
information about the natural features, events, and processes (FEPs) that can reasonably be 
expected to act on the disposal system.  While the list of possible FEPs is derived independently 
of the disposal system, their screening (in Section 6.2 and Appendix PA, Attachment SCR) is 
based on an understanding of the geology, hydrology, and climatology of the region and the site 
in particular.  The screening methodology follows U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 
criteria on the Scope of Performance Assessments (40 CFR § 191.32).  This basic understanding 
is provided in this chapter and its associated appendices.

Table 2-1 shows the tie between the list of natural FEPs that were identified and screened for the 
WIPP and the sections of this chapter or Appendix PA, Attachment SCR.  Those FEPs that have

been retained for inclusion in the modeling are shown in bold in Table 2-1.  These generally 
receive a greater level of detail in the following discussions and are supported by additional 
discussion in Chapter 6.0, Appendix PA, Attachments MASS and SCR.  In addition, parameter 
values that have been derived for these FEPs are included in Appendix PA, Attachment PAR.

In this chapter, the DOE describes the WIPP site geology, hydrology, climatology, air quality, 
ecology, and cultural and natural resources.  This chapter’s purpose is to (1) explain 
characteristics of the site, (2) describe background environmental quality, and (3) discuss 
features of the site that might be important for inclusion in a quantitative PA.  The DOE has used 
this information to develop and screen FEPs and to develop conceptual, mathematical, and 
computational models to evaluate the efficacy of natural and engineered barriers in meeting 
environmental performance standards (Chapter 6.0).  Results of these predictive models are used 
by the DOE to demonstrate that the DOE has a reasonable expectation that compliance with 
applicable regulations will be achieved.  This chapter has been prepared to describe the site prior 
to excavating the repository.  Excavation of the repository and its associated effects, such as the 
disturbed rock zone (DRZ), are discussed in Chapter 3.0.

The DOE located the WIPP site 42 km (26 mi) east of Carlsbad, New Mexico, in Eddy County 
(Figure 2-1).  Additional details related to the location of the WIPP site can be found in Section 
2.1.4.2 and in Figure 3-1 (see Chapter 3.0).  The latitude of the WIPP site center is 32E22' 11" N 
and the longitude is 103E47' 30" W.  The region surrounding the WIPP site has been studied for 
many years, and exploration of both potash and hydrocarbon deposits has provided extensive 
knowledge of the geology of the region.  Two exploratory holes were drilled by the federal 
government in 1974 at a location northeast of the present site; that location was abandoned in 
1975 as a possible repository site after U.S. Energy Research and Development Administration 
(ERDA) 6 borehole was drilled and unacceptable structure and pressurized brine were 
encountered.  The results of these investigations are reported in Powers et al. (1978, 2 – 6; 
included in CCA Appendix GCR).  During late 1975 and early 1976, the ERDA identified the 
current site, and an initial exploratory hole (ERDA-9) was drilled.  By the time an initial phase of 
site characterization was completed in August 1978, 47 holes had been or were being drilled for 
various hydrologic and geologic purposes.  Geophysical techniques were applied to augment 
data collected from boreholes.  Since 1978, the DOE has drilled additional holes to support 
hydrologic studies, geologic studies, and facility design.  Geophysical logs, cores, basic data 
reports, geochemical sampling and testing, and hydrological testing and analyses are reported by 
the DOE and its scientific advisor, Sandia National Laboratories (SNL), in numerous public 
documents.  Many of those documents form the basis for the DOE’s positions in this application.  
As necessary, specific references from these documents are cited to reinforce statements being 
made.

Biological studies of the site began in 1975 to gather information for the Environmental Impact 
Statement (DOE 1980).  Meteorological studies began in 1976, and economic studies were 
initiated in 1977.  Baseline environmental data were initially reported in 1977 and are now 
updated annually by the DOE.

The DOE located the WIPP disposal horizon within a rock salt deposit known as the Salado 
Formation at a depth of 650 m (2,150 ft) below the ground surface.  The Salado is regionally 
extensive, includes continuous beds of salt without complicated structure, is deep with little 
potential for dissolution in the immediate vicinity of the WIPP, and is near enough to the surface 
to make access reasonable.  Particular site selection criteria narrowed the choices when the 
present site was located during 1975 and 1976, as is discussed in CCA Appendix GCR and 
summarized by Weart (1983).

The DOE and its predecessor agencies determined at the outset of the geological disposal 
program that the geological characteristics of the disposal system are extremely important 
because the natural barriers provided by the geological units have a significant impact on the 
performance of the disposal system.  Among the DOE’s site selection criteria was the intent to 
maximize the beneficial impacts of the geology.  This was accomplished when the DOE selected 
(1) a host formation that behaves plastically, thereby creeping closed to encapsulate buried 
waste, (2) a location where the effects of dissolution are minimal and predictable, (3) an area 
where deformation of the rocks is low, (4) an area where excavation is relatively easy, (5) an 
area where future resource development is predictable and minimal, and (6) a repository host 
rock that is relatively uncomplicated lithologically and structurally.  Therefore, a thorough and 
accurate description of the WIPP facility’s natural environmental setting is considered crucial by 
the DOE for a demonstration of compliance with the disposal standards and is an EPA 
certification criterion in 40 CFR § 191.14(a).  The DOE is providing the detail necessary to 
assess the achievable degree of waste isolation.  In this chapter, the DOE addresses 
environmental factors and long-term environmental changes that are important for assessing the 
waste isolation potential of the disposal system.  The first of these environmental factors is 
geology.

Geological data have been collected from the WIPP site and surrounding area to evaluate the 
site’s suitability as a radioactive waste repository.  These data have been collected principally by 
the DOE, the DOE’s predecessor agencies, the United States Geological Survey (USGS), the 
New Mexico Bureau of Mines and Mineral Resources (NMBMMR), and private organizations 
engaged in natural resource exploration and extraction.  The DOE has analyzed the data and has 
determined that the data support the DOE’s position that the WIPP site is suitable for the long-
term isolation of radioactive waste.

Many issues have been discussed, investigated, and resolved in order for the DOE to conclude 
that the site is suitable.  The DOE discusses these issues in the following sections.  Most of the 
data collected have been reported or summarized in CCA Appendices GCR, SUM, HYDRO, and 
FAC.  These appendices represent the majority of the site characterization results for the WIPP 
site which ended in 1988.  A number of more focused geological and hydrological studies 
continued after this date.  These latter studies provided detailed information needed to construct 
the conceptual models for disposal system performance that are discussed in Section 6.4.  An 
example of these studies is the H-19 multiwell tracer test that was completed in early 1996.  
Results of this test were incorporated into the discussions in this chapter and into the conceptual 
models described in Section 6.4.6. Model parameters derived from the data are displayed in 
Appendix PA, Attachment PAR.  A discussion of the data is included in CCA Appendix MASS; 
and Appendix PA, Attachment MASS.

Geological field studies designed to collect data pertinent to the WIPP PA continue. The Culebra 
Dolomite Member and Magenta Dolomite Members are the two carbonates in the Rustler 
Formation, the youngest evaporite-bearing formation in the Delaware Basin.  Geologic data 
related to the Culebra and Magenta remain of particular interest, as these members are the most 
significant transmissive units at the WIPP site.

The EPA’s December 19, 1996 letter (A-93-02, Docket II-I-01) made a request to the DOE for 
recent studies that had provided detailed information used in developing conceptual models for 
disposal system performance. In a response letter to EPA dated February 26, 1997 (Docket A-93-
02, Item II-I-10), the DOE cited Holt (1997) for detailed information on the recent enhancement 
of the conceptual model for transport in the Culebra.  Holt (1997) discusses interpretation and 
conceptual insights obtained from field and laboratory tracer tests and core studies that support 
the double-porosity conceptual model of the Culebra, in which Culebra porosity is divided into 
advective and diffusive components.

Geological data provide the basis for a different approach to estimating the transmissivity field 
for modeling fluid flow and transport in the Culebra (Beauheim 2002). Geological data correlate 
strongly with Culebra transmissivity (Holt and Yarbrough 2002), and they are available from 
many more locations, such as industry (oil, gas, potash) drillholes, than are transmissivity data. 
With this correlation, Culebra properties can be inferred over a wide area, leading to an 
improved computational model of the spatial distribution of Culebra transmissivity.  Initial 
results from this computational model of the spatial distribution of Culebra transmissivity have 
been incorporated in the PA; they are discussed in more detail in Section 2.2.1.4.1.2, and are 
incorporated in Appendix PA, Attachment TFIELD.  Additional data in support of this modeling 
are being collected through field activities, including drilling and testing of new wells, to 
improve understanding of the Culebra and to assess the causes(s) of rising water levels (see 
Section 2.2.1.4.1.2).

The geology of southeastern New Mexico has been of great interest for more than a century.  The 
Guadalupe Mountains have become a common visiting and research point for geologists because 
of the spectacular exposures of Permian-age reef rocks and related facies (see Shumard 1858, 
Crandall 1929, Newell et al. 1953, and Dunham 1972 in the CCA bibliography).  Because of 
intense interest in both hydrocarbon and potash resources in the region, a large volume of data 
exists as background information for the WIPP site, though some data are proprietary.  Finally, 
there is the geological information developed directly and indirectly by studies sponsored by the 
DOE for the WIPP project; it ranges from raw data to interpretive reports.

Elements of the geology of southeastern New Mexico have been discussed or described in 
professional journals or technical documents from many different sources.  These types of 
articles are an important source of information, and where there is consistency among the 
technical community, the information in these articles is referenced when subject material is 
relevant.  Implicit rules of professional conduct for research and reporting have been assumed, as 
have journal and editorial review.  Elements of the geology presented in such sources have been 
deemed critical to the WIPP and have been the subject of specific DOE-sponsored WIPP studies.

The geological data that the DOE has developed explicitly for the WIPP project have been 
produced over a 25-year period by different organizations and contractors using applicable 
national standards (Quality Assurance Program history is described in Section 5.1.2).  During a 
rulemaking in 1988 related to the underground injection of hazardous wastes, the EPA addressed 
the use of older geological data in making a long-term demonstration of repository performance.  
In response to comments on a proposed rule regarding the permitting of underground injection

wells, the EPA concluded that “[e]xcluding historical data or information which might have been 
gathered off-site by methods not consistent with certain prescribed procedures may be 
counterproductive.”  The EPA further stated that such data should be used as long as their 
limitations are accounted for.  In the final rule, the EPA stipulated “that only measurements 
pertaining to the waste or that result from testing performed to gather data for the petition 
demonstration comply with prescribed procedures.”  Further, the EPA stated that “the concerns 
about the accuracy of geologic data are addressed more appropriately by requiring that the 
demonstration identify and account for the limits on data quality rather than by excluding data 
from consideration” (EPA 1988).

As site characterization activities progressed, the DOE, along with independent review groups 
such as the National Academy of Sciences (NAS), the Environmental Evaluation Group (EEG), 
and the state of New Mexico acting through the Governor’s Radioactive Waste Consultation 
Task Force, identified natural  FEPs that required additional detailed investigation.  Because 
these investigations, in many cases, were to gather data that would either be used in developing 
conceptual models or in the prediction of disposal system performance, the quality assurance 
(QA) standards applied to these investigations were more stringent, thereby ensuring accuracy 
and repeatability to the extent possible for geologic investigations.

Geological data from site characterization have been developed by the DOE through a variety of 
WIPP-sponsored studies using drilling, mapping or other direct observation, geophysical 
techniques, and laboratory work.  Most of the techniques and statistics of data acquisition will be 
incorporated by specific discussion.  The processes used in deriving modeling parameters from 
field and laboratory data are discussed in records packages which support the conceptual models 
in Section 6.4 and the parameters in Appendix PA, Attachment PAR.  Pointers to these records 
packages are provided principally in Appendix PA, Attachment PAR.  Records packages are 
stored in the Sandia WIPP Records Center in Carlsbad.  Access to review of these records 
packages can be obtained by contacting the person designated in Table 1-10.  Borehole 
investigations are a major source of geological data for the WIPP and surrounding area.  
Borehole studies provide raw data (for example, depth measurements, amount of core, 
geophysical logs) that support point data and interpreted data sets.  These data sets are used in 
developing other analysis tools such as structure maps for selected stratigraphic horizons or 
isopachs (thicknesses) of selected stratigraphic intervals.

The borehole data set that was used specifically for obtaining WIPP geologic information is 
included as reference information in CCA Appendix BH. A map of some borehole locations in 
the data set is provided in Figure 2-2.  Figure 2-3 shows Culebra monitoring wells within the site 
boundary as of December 2002, including well C-2737, which was drilled and completed in 
2001 (Powers 2002c).  Figure 2-4 shows Culebra monitoring wells outside the WIPP site as of 
December 2002; plugged and abandoned wells formerly monitored are not included in this 
figure. Figure 2-5 shows the locations of wells configured to monitor the Magenta, including 
well C-2737.  Other hydrostratigraphic units are monitored in wells shown in Figure 2-6, 
including well C-2811, which was drilled and completed in 2001 to monitor a shallow saturated 
zone developed since the WIPP surface structures were constructed (Powers and Stensrud 2003).  
Other holes are not shown because they were not of sufficient depth, were not cored, or were not 
drilled for purposes of site characterization.  A more comprehensive drillhole database of the

In this section, the DOE summarizes the more important points of the area’s geologic history 
within about 320 km (200 mi) of the WIPP site, with emphasis on more recent or nearby events.  
Figure 2-7 shows the major elements of the area’s geological history from the end of the 
Precambrian Period.

The geologic time scale that the DOE uses for WIPP is based on the compilation by Palmer 
(1983, pp. 503 – 504) for The Decade of North American Geology (DNAG).  There are several 
compiled sources of chronologic data related to different reference sections or methods (see, for 
example, Harland et al. 1989 and Salvador 1985.  Although most of these sources show generally 
similar ages for chronostratigraphic boundaries, there is no consensus on either reference 
boundaries or most-representative ages.  The DNAG scale is accepted by the DOE as a standard 
that is useful and sufficient for WIPP purposes, as no known critical performance assessment 
parameters require more accurate or precise dates. 
16 
The geologic history in this region can be conveniently subdivided into three general phases: 
17 
18 
• A Precambrian Period, represented by metamorphic and igneous rocks ranging in age 
from about 1.5 to 1.1 billion years; 
19 
20 
• A period from about 1.1 to 0.6 billion years ago, from which no rocks are preserved.  
Erosion may have been the dominant process during much of this period; and 
21 
22 
• An interval from 0.6 billion years ago to the present represented by a more complex set 
of mainly sedimentary rocks and shorter periods of erosion and dissolution. 
23 
This latter phase is the main subject of the DOE’s detailed discussion in this text.

Only a few boreholes in the WIPP region have bored deep enough to penetrate Precambrian 
crystalline rocks, and, therefore, relatively little petrological information is available.  Foster 
(1974, Figure 3) extrapolated the elevation of the Precambrian surface under the area of WIPP as 
being between 4.42 km (14,500 ft) and 4.57 km (15,000 ft) below sea level; the site surface at 
WIPP is about 1,036 m (3,400 ft) above sea level.  Keesey (1976, Vol. II, Exhibit No. 2) 
projected a depth of about 5,545 m (18,200 ft) from the surface to the top of Precambrian rocks 
in the vicinity of the WIPP.  The depth projection is based on the geology of the nearby borehole 
in Section 15, T22S, R31E. 
32 
33 
34 
Precambrian rocks of several types crop out in the following locations:  the Sacramento 
Mountains northwest of WIPP; around the Sierra Diablo and Baylor Mountains near Van Horn, 
Texas; west of the Guadalupe Mountains at Pump Station Hills; and in the Franklin Mountains

near El Paso, Texas.  East of the WIPP, a relatively large number of boreholes on the Central 
Basin Platform have penetrated the top of the Precambrian (Foster 1974, Figure 3).  As 
summarized by Foster (1974, 10), Precambrian rocks in the area considered similar to those in 
the vicinity of the site range in age from about 1.14 to 1.35 billion years.

For about 500 million years (1.1 to 0.6 billion years ago), there is no certain rock record in the 
region around the WIPP.  The most likely rock record for this period may be the Van Horn 
sandstone (McGowan and Groat 1971), but there is no conclusive evidence that it represents part 
of this time period (CCA Appendix GCR, Section 3.3.1).  The region is generally thought to 
have been subject to erosion for much of the period until the Bliss sandstone began to 
accumulate during the Cambrian.

The conceptual model of the disposal system uses information about the geometry of the various 
rock layers as a model input as described in Section 6.4.2.1.  This means that stratigraphic 
information (thickness and lateral extent) provided in the following sections are important inputs.

In addition, less important features such as the lithology and the presence of geochemically 
significant minerals are provided to support screening arguments in Appendix PA, Attachment 
SCR.  Consequently, this discussion has focused on the general properties of the various rock 
units as determined from field studies.  Specific parameters used in the modeling described in 
Sections 6.4.5 and 6.4.6 are summarized in Appendix PA, Attachment PAR.  Stratigraphy-
related parameters are input as constants.  Stratigraphic thicknesses of units considered in 
modeling are compiled in Appendix PA, Attachment PAR, Table PAR-49.

This section describes the stratigraphy and lithology of the Paleozoic and younger rocks 
underlying the WIPP site and vicinity (Figure 2-8), emphasizing the units nearer the surface.  
After briefly describing pre-Permian rocks, the section provides detailed information on the 
Permian (Guadalupian) Bell Canyon Formation (hereafter referred to as the Bell Canyon)—the 
upper unit of the Delaware Mountain Group—because this is the uppermost transmissive 
formation below the evaporites.  The principal stratigraphic data are the chronologic sequence, 
age, and extent of rock units, including some of the nearby relevant facies changes.  For deeper 
rocks, characteristics such as thickness and depth are summarized from published sources, and 
for shallower rocks, they are mainly based on data sets presented in CCA Appendix BH (above 
the Bell Canyon).  The lithologies of upper formations and some formation members are 
described.  A comprehensive discussion of stratigraphy in the WIPP area is presented in CCA 
Appendix GCR.  Detailed referencing to original investigations by the USGS and others is 
included.

As stated previously, the Precambrian basement near the site is projected to be about 5,545 m 
(18,200 ft) below the surface (Keesey 1976, Vol. II, Exhibit No. 2), consistent with information 
presented by Foster in 1974.  Ages of similar rock suites in the region range from about 1.14 to 
1.35 billion years.

A detailed discussion of the distribution of Precambrian rocks in southeastern New Mexico and 
Texas can be found in CCA Appendix GCR.  Figure 3.4-2 in CCA Appendix GCR provides a 
structure contour map of the Precambrian. The basal Paleozoic units overlying Precambrian 
rocks are clastic rocks commonly attributed either to the Cambrian Bliss sandstone or the 
Ellenberger Group (Foster 1974, p. 10), considered most likely to be Ordovician in age in this 
area.  The Ordovician System comprises the Ellenberger, Simpson, and Montoya Groups in the 
northern Delaware Basin.  Carbonates are predominant in these groups, with sandstones and 
shales common in the Simpson Group.  Foster (1974, Figure 4) reported 297 m (975 ft) of 
Ordovician-age rocks north of the site area and extrapolated a thicker section of about 396 m 
(1,300 ft) at the present site (Foster 1974, Figure 5).  Keesey (1976, Vol. II, Exhibit No. 2) 
projected a thickness of 366 m (1,200 ft) for the Ordovician System within the site boundaries.

Silurian-Devonian rocks in the Delaware Basin are not stratigraphically well defined, and there 
are various notions for extending nomenclature into the basin.  Common drilling practice is not 
to differentiate, though the Upper Devonian Woodford shale at the top of the sequence is 
frequently distinguished from the underlying dolomite and limestone (Foster 1974, p. 18).  Foster 
(1974, Figure 6) showed a reference thickness of 384 and 49 m (1,260 and 160 ft) for the 
carbonates and the Woodford shale, respectively; he estimated thickness of these units at the 
present WIPP site to be about 351 m (1,150 ft) (Foster 1974, Figure 7) and 52 m (170 ft) (Foster 
1974, Figure 8), respectively.  Keesey (1976, Vol. II, Exhibit No. 2) projected 381 m (1,250 ft) 
of carbonate and showed 25 m (82 ft) of the Woodford shale.

30

The Mississippian System in the northern Delaware Basin is commonly attributed to 
Mississippian limestone and the overlying Barnett shale (Foster 1974, p. 24), but the 
nomenclature is not consistently used.  At the reference well used by Foster (1974, 25), the 
limestone is 165 m (540 ft) thick and the shale is 24 m (80 ft); isopachs at the WIPP are 146 m 
(480 ft) (Foster 1974, Figure 10) and less than 61 m (200 ft).  Keesey (1976, Vol. II, Exhibit No. 
2) indicates 156 m (511 ft) and 50 m (164 ft), respectively, within the site boundaries.

The nomenclature of the Pennsylvanian System applied within the Delaware Basin is both varied 
and commonly inconsistent with accepted stratigraphic rules.  Chronostratigraphic, or time-
stratigraphic, names are applied from base to top of these lithologic units:  the Morrow, Atoka, 
and Strawn (Foster 1974, p. 31).  Foster (1974, Figure 13) extrapolated thicknesses of about 671 
m (2,200 ft) for the Pennsylvanian at the WIPP site.  Keesey (1976, Vol. II, Exhibit No. 2) 
reports 636 m (2,088 ft) for these units.  The Pennsylvanian rocks in this area are mixed clastics 
and carbonates, with carbonates more abundant in the upper half of the sequence.

The Permian is the thickest system in the northern Delaware Basin, and it is divided into four 
series from the base to top:  Wolfcampian, Leonardian, Guadalupian, and Ochoan.  According to 
Keesey (1976, Vol. II, Exhibit No. 2), the three lower series total 2,647 m (8,684 ft) near the site.

Foster (1974, Figures 14, 16, and 18) indicates a total thickness for the lower three series of 
2,336 m (7,665 ft) for a reference well north of WIPP.  Foster’s isopach maps of these series 
(Foster 1974, Figures 15, 17, and 19) indicate about 2,591 m (8,500 ft) for the WIPP site area.  
The Ochoan Series at the top of the Permian is considered in more detail later because the 
formations host and surround the WIPP repository horizon.  Its thickness at DOE-2, about 3.2 
km (2 mi) north of the site center, is 1,200 m (3,938 ft), according to Mercer et al. (1987, p. 23).

The Wolfcampian Series is also referred to as the Wolfcamp Formation (hereafter referred to as 
the Wolfcamp) in the Delaware Basin.  In the site area, the lower part of the Wolfcamp is 
dominantly shale with carbonate and some sandstone, according to Foster (1974, Figure 14); 
carbonate increases to the north (Foster 1974, p. 36).  Clastics increase to the east toward the 
margin of the Central Basin Platform.  Keesey (1976, Vol. II, Exhibit No. 2) reports the 
Wolfcamp to be 455 m (1,493 ft) thick at a well near the WIPP site.

The Leonardian Series is represented by the Bone Spring Limestone or Formation (hereafter 
referred to as the Bone Spring).  According to Foster (1974, pp. 35 - 36), the lower part of the 
formation is commonly interbedded carbonate, sandstone, and some shale, while the upper part is 
dominantly carbonate.  Near the site the Bone Spring is 990 m (3,247 ft) thick, according to 
Keesey (1976, Vol. II, Exhibit No. 2).

The Guadalupian Series is represented in the general area of the site by a number of formations 
exhibiting complex facies relationships (Figure 2-9).  The Guadalupian Series is known in 
considerable detail west of the site from outcrops in the Guadalupe Mountains, where numerous 
outcrops are present and subsurface studies have been undertaken.  (See, for example, King 
1948, Newell et al. 1953, and Dunham 1972 in the CCA bibliography.)

Within the Delaware Basin, the Guadalupian Series, known as the Delaware Mountain Group, 
comprises three formations:  Brushy Canyon, Cherry Canyon, and Bell Canyon, from base to 
top.  These formations are dominated by submarine channel sandstones with interbedded 
limestone and some shale.  The Lamar limestone generally tops the series, immediately 
underneath the Castile Formation (hereafter referred to as the Castile).  Around the margin of the 
Delaware Basin, reefs developed when the Cherry Canyon and Bell Canyon were being 
deposited.  These massive reef limestones, the Goat Seep and Capitan Limestones, are equivalent 
in time to the basin sandstone formations but were developed topographically much higher 
around the basin margin.  A complex set of limestone-to-sandstone and evaporite beds was 
deposited further away from the basin, behind the reef limestones.  The Capitan Reef and back-
reef limestones are well known because numerous caves, including the Carlsbad Caverns, are 
partially developed in these rocks.

As will be discussed in Section 2.1.3.3, the Castile is a 427-to-487m (1,400-to-1,600ft) thick 
layer of nearly impermeable anhydrites and halites that isolate the Salado from the

deeper water-bearing rocks.  This notwithstanding, the DOE is interested in the Bell Canyon 
because it is the first laterally continuous transmissive unit below the WIPP repository.  The 
significance of this unit is related to the FEP in Table 2-1 for deep dissolution.  In evaluating this 
FEP, the DOE considers the potential for groundwater to migrate from the Bell Canyon or lower 
units into the repository and cause dissolution.  The following discussion summarizes the basic 
understanding of the Bell Canyon lithology.  Dissolution is discussed in Section 2.1.6.  Bell 
Canyon hydrology is presented in Section 2.2.1.2.  A thorough discussion of dissolution is in 
CCA Appendix DEF. 
The Bell Canyon is known from outcrops on the west side of the Delaware Basin and from 
subsurface intercepts for oil and gas drilling.  Several informal lithologic units are commonly 
named during such drilling.  Mercer et al. (1987, p. 28) stated that DOE-2 penetrated the Lamar 
limestone, the Ramsey sand, the Ford shale, the Olds sand, and the Hays sand.  This informal 
nomenclature is used for the Bell Canyon in some other WIPP reports.

The Clayton Williams Badger Federal borehole (Section 15, T22S, R31E) intercepted 961 feet 
(293 meters) of Bell Canyon, including the Lamar limestone, according to Keesey (1976, Vol. II, 
Exhibit No. 2).  Reservoir sandstones of the Bell Canyon were deposited in channels that are 
straight to slightly sinuous.  In their 1988 paper, Harms and Williamson proposed that density 
currents flowed from shelf regions, cutting channels and depositing the sands.

Within the basin, the Bell Canyon (Lamar limestone) Castile contact is distinctive on 
geophysical logs because of the contrast in low natural gamma of the basal Castile anhydrite 
compared to the underlying limestone.  Density or acoustic logs are also distinctive because of 
the massive and uniform lithology of the anhydrite compared to the underlying beds.  In cores, 
the transition is sharp, as described by Mercer et al. (1987, 312) for DOE-2.  A structure contour 
map of the top of the Bell Canyon is shown in Figure 2-10.  Also see CCA Appendix MASS, 
MASS Attachment 18-6, Figure 5.3-3.  According to Powers et al. (1978) (CCA Appendix GCR, 
4–59), this structure does not reflect the structure of deeper formations, suggesting different 
deformation histories.  The rootless character of at least some of the normal faulting in the lower 
Permian suggests these are shallow-seated features. 
29 
2.1.3.3 The Castile 
30 
31 
32 
The Castile is the lowermost lithostratigraphic unit of the Late Permian Ochoan Series (Figure 2-
11) and is part of the thick layer of evaporites within the WIPP disposal system.  It was 
originally named by Richardson (1904, p. 43) for outcrops in Culberson County, Texas. 
The Castile crops out along a lengthy area of the western side of the Delaware Basin.  The two 
distinctive lithologic sequences now known as the Castile and the Salado were separated into the 
Upper and Lower Castile by Cartwright (1930).  Lang (1939) clarified the nomenclature by 
restricting the Castile to the lower unit and naming the upper unit the Salado.  By defining an 
anhydrite resting on the marginal Capitan limestone as part of the Salado, Lang in 1939 
effectively restricted the Castile to the Delaware Basin inside the reef rocks.

Through detailed studies of the Castile, Anderson et al. (1972) introduced an informal system of 
names that is widely used and included in many WIPP reports.  The units are named from the 
base as anhydrite I (A1), halite I (H1), anhydrite II (A2), etc.  The informal nomenclature varies 
through the basin from A3 up because of complexity of the depositional system.  The Castile 
consists almost entirely of thick beds of two lithologies:  (1) interlaminated carbonate and 
anhydrite, and (2) high-purity halite.

In the eastern part of the Delaware basin, the Castile thickness ranges from about 299 to 616 m 
(980 to 2,022 ft) (derived from Powers et al. 1996, Figure 5.3-1; see also Borns and Shaffer 
1985, Figures 9, 11, and 16 for an earlier range based on fewer drillholes).  At DOE-2, the 
Castile is 301 m (989 ft) thick.  The Castile is thinner in the western part of the Delaware Basin, 
and it lacks halite units.

Anderson et al. (1978) and Anderson (1978, Figures 1, 3, 4, and 5) correlated geophysical logs 
throughout the WIPP region, interpreting thin zones equivalent to halite units as dissolution 
residues.  Anderson et al. (1972, p. 81) further attributed the lack of halite in the basin to its 
removal by dissolution.  A structure contour map of the top of the Castile is reported in Figure 
4.4-6, CCA Appendix GCR based on seismic data gathered for site characterization.  In addition, 
Borns et al. (1983) prepared a seismic time structure of the middle Castile for identifying 
deformation.  This map is shown in Figure DEF-2.2 in CCA Appendix DEF.  Powers et al. 
(1996; Figures 5.2-1, 5.2-2, and 5.2-3) provide comparative figures of the elevations of the top of 
the Bell Canyon, top of Anhydrite 2 (of the Castile), and top of Anhydrite 3 (of the Castile), 
respectively, based on geophysical log data from oil and gas wells.

For borehole DOE-2, a primary objective was to ascertain whether a series of depressions in the 
Salado 3.3 km (2 mi) north of the site center was from dissolution in the Castile and related 
processes, as proposed by Davies (1984, p. 175) in his doctoral thesis. Studies have suggested 
that these depressions were not from dissolution but from halokinesis in the Castile (see, for 
example, Borns 1987).  Robinson and Powers (1987, pp. 22 and 78) interpreted one deformed 
zone in the Castile in the western part of the Delaware Basin as partly caused by synsedimentary, 
gravity-driven, clastic deposition and suggested that the extent of dissolution may have been 
overestimated by previous workers. No Castile dissolution is known to be present in the 
immediate vicinity of the WIPP site. The process of dissolution and the resulting features are 
discussed later in this chapter. See CCA Appendix DEF, Section DEF.3 for a more in-depth 
discussion of the study of dissolution in the Castile. 
33

35 
36 
In Culberson County, Texas, the Castile hosts major native sulfur deposits.  The outcrops of 
Castile on the Gypsum Plain south of White’s City, New Mexico, have been explored for native 
sulfur without success, and there is no reported indication of native sulfur anywhere in the 
vicinity of the WIPP.

In part of the area around the WIPP, the Castile has been significantly deformed and there are 
pressurized brines associated with the deformed areas; borehole ERDA-6 encountered both 
deformation and pressurized brine.  WIPP-12, 1.6 km (1 mi) north of the site center, revealed 
lesser Castile structure, but it also encountered a zone of pressurized brine within the Castile.  
Castile deformation is described and discussed in Section 2.1.5 and in CCA Appendix DEF,

Where they exist, Castile brine reservoirs in the northern Delaware Basin are believed to be 
fractured systems, with high-angle fractures spaced widely enough that a borehole can penetrate 
through a volume of rock containing a brine reservoir without intersecting any fractures and 
therefore not produce brine.  They occur in the upper portion of the Castile (Popielak et al. 
1983).  Appreciable volumes of brine have been produced from several reservoirs in the 
Delaware Basin, but there is little direct information on the areal extent of the reservoirs or the 
interconnection between them.  The presence of a pressurized brine pocket is treated in the 
conceptual model of WIPP as discussed in Section 6.4.8.

The Castile continues to be an object of research interest unrelated to the WIPP program as an 
example of evaporites supposedly deposited in deep water.  Anderson (1993, pp. 12-13) 
discusses alternatives and contradictory evidence.  Becker et al. (2002) presented a data set 
yielding a total Pb/U isochron age of 251.5 ± 2.8 million years (Ma) for calcite from the Castile 
and inferred that the Permo-Triassic boundary could be younger than this date.  This discussion 
contrasts with other data regarding age of the Salado, Rustler, and Dewey Lake Formations (see 
later sections), including evidence that later formations yield slightly older radiometric ages.  
Although these discussions and a resolution might eventually affect some concepts of Castile 
deposition and dissolution, this issue is largely of academic interest and bears no impact on the 
suitability of the Los Medaños region for the WIPP site.  Additional discussion of Castile 
deformation and the associated WIPP studies appears in Section 2.1.6.1 and CCA Appendix 
DEF.  The Castile is included in the conceptual model as described in Section 6.4.8.  As shown 
in Appendix PA, Attachment PAR, Table PAR-43, no stratigraphic or lithologic parameters are 
of importance for this unit.  Important hydrological parameters are discussed subsequently.

The EPA questioned DOE’s geologic and geophysical basis for the probability (i.e., eight percent 
probability) of intercepting pressurized brine in the Castile Formation beneath the WIPP disposal 
panels, and therefore required this distribution to be revised (to a uniform distribution with a 
range of 0.01 to 0.6) in Performance Assessment Verification Testing (PAVT) (Docket A-93-02, 
Item II-I-25).  The formation of Castile brine pockets as a result of Castile deformation was 
described in the CCA, and although DOE’s discussion of the distribution and nature of fractures 
in the Castile was limited, parameters were modified to include larger Castile brine pockets in 
the PAVT.  Further information on this topic is contained in EPA Technical Support Document 
for Section 194.14:  Content of Compliance Certification Application, Section IV.C (Docket A-
93-02, Item V-B-3), EPA Technical Support Document for Section 194.23:  Parameter

The Salado is of interest because it contains the repository horizon and provides the primary 
natural barrier for the long-term containment of radionuclides.  The following section provides 
basic information regarding the genesis and lithology of the Salado.  Subsequent sections discuss

detailed information about the Salado from early site characterization studies.

The Salado is dominated by halite, in contrast to the underlying Castile.  The Salado extends well 
beyond the Delaware Basin, and Lowenstein (1988, p. 592) has termed the Salado a saline 
“giant.”

While the Fletcher Anhydrite Member, which is deposited on the Capitan Reef rocks, is defined 
by Lang (1939; 1942) as the base of the Salado, some investigators consider that the Fletcher 
Anhydrite Member may interfinger with anhydrites normally considered part of the Castile.  The 
Castile-Salado contact is not uniform across the basin, and whether it is conformable is 
unresolved.  Around the WIPP site, the Castile-Salado contact is commonly placed at the top of a 
thick anhydrite informally designated A3; the overlying halite is called the infra-Cowden salt and 
is included within the Salado.  Bodine (1978, pp. 28 - 29) suggests that the clay mineralogy of 
the infra-Cowden in ERDA-9 cores changes at about 4.6 m (15 ft) above the lowermost Salado 
and that the lowermost clays are more like Castile clays.  At the WIPP site, the DOE recognizes 
the top of the thick A3 anhydrite as the local contact for differentiating the Salado from the 
Castile and notes that the distinction is related only to nomenclature and has no relevance to the 
performance of the WIPP disposal system.

The Salado in the northern Delaware Basin is broadly divided into three informal members.  The 
middle member is known locally as the McNutt Potash Zone (hereafter referred to as McNutt) or 
Member, and it includes 11 defined potash zones, 10 of which are of economic significance in 
the Carlsbad Potash District.  The lower member and the upper member remain unnamed.  The 
WIPP repository level is located below the McNutt in the lower member.  Figure 2-12 shows 
details of the Salado stratigraphy near the excavated regions.  Elements of this stratigraphy are 
important to the conceptual model.  The conceptual model for the Salado is discussed in Section 
6.4.5.  The thicknesses used in the model are given in Appendix PA, Attachment PAR, Table 
PAR-49.

Within the Delaware Basin, a system is used for numbering the more significant sulfate beds 
within the Salado, designating these beds as marker beds (MBs) from MB 100 (near the top of 
the formation) to MB 144 (near the base).  The system is generally used within the Carlsbad 
Potash District as well as at and around the WIPP site.  The repository is located between MB 
139 and MB 138.

In the central and eastern part of the Delaware Basin, the Salado is at its thickest, ranging up to 
about 600 m (2,000 ft) thick and consisting mainly of interbeds of sulfate minerals and halite, 
with halite dominating.  The thinnest portions of the Salado consist of a brecciated residue of 
insoluble material a few tens-of-feet thick, which is exposed in parts of the western Delaware 
Basin.  The common sulfate minerals are anhydrite (CaSO4), gypsum (CaSO4 • 2H2O) near the 
surface, and polyhalite (K2SO4 • MgSO4 • 2CaSO4 • 2H2O).  They form interbeds and are also 
found along halite grain boundaries.  Isopach maps of various intervals of the Salado above the 
repository horizon have been provided to assist in understanding regional structure.  These are 
Figures 4.3-4 to 4.3-7 in CCA Appendix GCR.  A structure contour map of the Salado can be 
found in CCA Appendix GCR (Figure 4.4-10).

In the vicinity of the repository, authigenic quartz (SiO2) and magnesite (MgCO3) are also 
present as accessory minerals.  Interbeds in the salt are predominantly anhydrite with seams of 
clay.  The clays within the Salado are enriched in magnesium and depleted in aluminum (Bodine 
1978, p. 1).  The magnesium enrichment probably reflects the intimate contact of the clays with 
brines derived from evaporating sea water, which are relatively high in magnesium.

Powers et al. (Chapter 7 of CCA Appendix GCR) studied the geochemistry of the rocks in the 
vicinity of the disposal system.  A partial list of minerals found in the Delaware Basin evaporites, 
together with their chemical formulas, is given in Table 2-2.  The table also indicates the relative 
abundances of the minerals in the evaporite rocks of the Castile, Salado, and Rustler.  Minerals 
found either only at depth, removed from influence of weathering, or only near the surface, as 
weathering products, are also identified.

Although the most common Delaware Basin evaporite mineral is halite, the presence of less 
soluble interbeds (dominantly anhydrite, polyhalite, and claystone) and more soluble admixtures 
(for example, sylvite, glauberite, kainite) has resulted in chemical and physical properties of the 
bulk Salado that are significantly different from those of pure halite layers contained within it.  
In particular, the McNutt, between MB 116 and MB 126, is locally explored and mined for 
potassium-bearing minerals of economic interest.  Under differential stress, interbeds (anhydrite, 
polyhalite, magnesite, dolomite) may fracture while, under the same stress regime, pure halite 
would undergo plastic deformation.  Fracturing of relatively brittle beds, for example, has locally 
enhanced the permeability, allowing otherwise nonporous rock to carry groundwater.  Some 
soluble minerals incorporated in the rock salt can be radiometrically dated, and their dates 
indicate the time of their formation.  The survival of such minerals is significant, in that such 
dating is impossible in pure halite or anhydrite.

Liquids were collected from fluid inclusions in the Salado halite and from seeps and boreholes 
within the WIPP drifts.  Analysis of these samples indicated that there is compositional 
variability in the fluids that shows the effects of various phase transformations on brine 
composition.  The fluid inclusions belong to a different chemical population than do the fluids 
emanating from the walls.  It was concluded that much of the brine is completely immobilized 
within the salt and that the free liquid emanating from the walls is present as a fluid film along 
intergranular boundaries, mainly in clays and in fractures in anhydrites.  Additional information 
can be found in CCA Appendix GCR, Sections 7.5 and 7.6.

Early investigators of the Salado recognized a repetitious vertical succession or cycle of beds in 
the Salado:  clay - anhydrite - polyhalite - halite and minor polyhalite - halite.  Later investigators 
described the cyclical units as clay - magnesite - anhydrite or polyhalite or glauberite - halite - 
argillaceous halite capped by mudstone.  Lowenstein (1988, pp. 592 - 608) defined a 
depositional cycle (Type I) consisting of (1) basal mixed siliciclastic and carbonate (magnesite) 
mudstone, (2) laminated to massive anhydrite or polyhalite, (3) halite, and (4) halite with mud.  
Lowenstein also recognized repetitious sequences of halite and halite with mud as incomplete 
Type I cycles and termed them Type II cycles.  Lowenstein (1988, pp. 592 - 608) interpreted the 
Type I cycles as having formed in a shallowing upward, desiccating basin beginning with a 
perennial lake or lagoon of marine origin and evaporating to saline lagoon and salt pan 
environments.  Type II cycles are differentiated because they do not exhibit features of 
prolonged subaqueous deposition and also have more siliciclastic influx than do Type I cycles.

From detailed mapping of the Salado in the air intake shaft (AIS) at WIPP, Holt and Powers 
(1990a, pp. 2-26) interpreted depositional cycles of the Salado in terms of modern features such 
as those at Devil’s Golf Course at Death Valley National Monument, California.  The 
evaporative basin was desiccated, and varying amounts of insoluble residues had collected on the 
surface through surficial dissolution, eolian sedimentation, and some clastic sedimentation from 
temporary flooding caused from surrounding areas.  The surface developed local relief that could 
be mapped in some cycles, while the action of continuing desiccation and exposure increasingly 
concentrated insoluble residues.  Flooding, most commonly from marine sources, reset the 
sedimentary cycle by depositing a sulfate bed.

The details available from the shaft demonstrated the important role of syndepositional water 
level to water table changes that created solution pits and pipes within the halitic beds while they

were at the surface.  Holt and Powers (1990a, Appendix F) concluded that passive halite cements 
filled the pits and pipes, as well as less dramatic voids, as the water table rose.  Early diagenetic 
to synsedimentary cements filled the porosity early and rather completely with commonly clear 
and coarsely crystalline halite, reducing the porosity to a very small volume according to Casas 
and Lowenstein (1989).

Although Holt and Powers (1990a) found no evidence for postdepositional halite dissolution in 
the AIS, dissolution of the upper Salado halite has occurred west of the WIPP.  Effects of 
dissolution are visible in Nash Draw and at other localities where gypsum karst has formed, 
where units above the Salado such as the Rustler Formation, Dewey Lake Redbeds, and post-
Permian rocks have subsided.  Dissolution studies are summarized in CCA Appendix DEF, 
Section DEF.3.  The dissolution margin of upper Salado halite (see Figure 2-13), based on 
changes in thickness of the interval from the Culebra dolomite to the Vaca Triste Sandstone 
Member of the Salado, has been interpreted in detail by Powers (2002a, 2002b, 2003a), Holt and 
Powers (2002), and Powers et al. (2003).  Powers (2002a, 2002b, 2003a) examined data from 
additional drillholes and noted that the upper Salado dissolution margin appears relatively 
narrow in many areas, and it directly underlies much of Livingston Ridge.  The hydraulic 
properties of the Culebra correlate in part with dissolution of halite from the upper Salado (Holt 
and Yarbrough 2002; Powers et al. 2003), and the relationships are further described in Section 
2.2.1.4.1.2.

Within Nash Draw, Robinson and Lang (1938, pp. 87-88) recognized a zone equivalent to the 
upper Salado but lacking halite.  Test wells in southern Nash Draw produced brine from this 
interval, and it has become known as the brine aquifer.  Robinson and Lang (1938) considered 
this zone a residuum from dissolution of Salado halite (see Section 2.1.6.2).  Jones et al. (1960) 
remarked that the residuum should be considered part of the Salado, though in geophysical logs 
it may resemble the lower Rustler.  The approximate eastern limit of the residuum and brine 
aquifer lies near Livingston Ridge (the eastward margin of Nash Draw) and is marked by a 
thickening of the Salado (see Section 2.1.6.2.2).

At the center of the site, Holt and Powers (1984, pp. 4-9) recognized clasts of fossil fragments 
and mapped channeling in siltstones and mudstones above the halite; they considered these beds 
to be a normal part of the transition from the shallow evaporative lagoons and desiccated salt 
pans of the Salado to the saline lagoon of the lower Rustler.  Although some Salado halite 
dissolution at the WIPP may have occurred before deposition of the Rustler clastics, this process 
was quite different from the subsurface removal of salt from the Salado in more recent time that 
caused the residuum and associated brine aquifer in Nash Draw.

Geochronological investigations provide a means to confirm the physical evidence indicating 
that little or no rock-water interactions have occurred in the Salado at the WIPP since the Late 
Permian Period.  Radiometric techniques provide a means of determining the approximate time 
of the latest episode of regional recrystallization of evaporite minerals, which can be inferred as 
the approximate time of the latest episode of freely circulating groundwater.  Radiometric dates 
for minerals of the Salado are available from mines and boreholes in the vicinity of the WIPP 
(Register and Brookins, 1980, pp. 30-42; Brookins, 1980, pp. 29-31; Brookins, et al. 1980, pp. 
635-637; Brookins, 1981; and Brookins and Lambert, 1987, pp. 771-780).  The distribution of 
dates shows that many of the rubidium-strontium (Rb-Sr) isochron determinations on evaporite 
minerals, largely sylvite (214 ± 14 million years ago), are in good agreement with potassium-
argon (K-Ar) determinations on pure polyhalites (198 to 216 million years ago).  (Potassium-
argon ages for sylvite are significantly younger than Rb-Sr ages for the same rocks because of 
the loss of radiogenic argon.  Radiogenic strontium, as a solid, is less mobile than argon and 
therefore the Rb-Sr isochron method is preferred for sylvite.)  Renne et al. (1998) sampled 
langbeinite crystals from the Salado and obtained Ar-39/Ar-40 plateau ages of 251 ± 0.2 Ma and 
251 ± 0.4 Ma.  Clay minerals have both Rb-Sr and K-Ar ages significantly older (390 ± 77 
million years [Register, 1981]) than the evaporite minerals, presumably reflecting the detrital 
origin of the clays.

One significantly younger recrystallization event has been identified in evaporites in the WIPP 
region and is a contact phenomenon associated with the emplacement of an Oligocene igneous 
dike (see Section 2.1.5.4).  Polyhalite near the dike yields a radiometric age of 21 million years, 
compared to the 32- to 34-million-year age determined for the dike (Brookins, 1980, pp. 29-31; 
and Calzia and Hiss, 1978, p. 44) (this number was recalculated to 34.8 ± 0.8 million years; CCA 
Appendix GCR, pp. 3 - 80).  This exception notwithstanding, the results of radiometric 
determinations argue for the absence of pervasive recrystallization of the evaporites in the Salado 
in the last 200 million years.  This conclusion is supported by the number of replicate 
determinations, the wide distribution of similarly dated minerals throughout the Delaware Basin, 
and the concordance of dates obtained by various radiometric methods.

The notion of extensive recrystallization of Salado evaporites has been raised again since the 
CCA was submitted.  Hazen and Roedder (2001), reiterating some arguments presented by 
Roedder (1984) and O’Neill et al. (1986), suggested that halite has been extensively 
recrystallized by water moving through the Salado at unknown times.  Stable isotope data from 
fluid inclusions within coarse, clear halite crystals were interpreted as signifying that modern 
meteoric water constituted part of the fluid inclusion.  O’Neill et al. (1986) noted as well that the 
stable isotope data are consistent with meteoric water falling on a desiccated Salado salt pan 
surface.  Powers and Hassinger (1985) and Holt and Powers (1990a, 1990b) interpret 
syndepositional dissolution pipes as a common feature of the Salado, with coarse, clear halite 
with large fluid inclusions formed on a desiccated salt pan.  Powers et al. (2001) summarized the 
arguments against extensive recrystallization of Salado halite.  Stein and Krumhansl (1988) 
found variable compositions of large fluid inclusions, and show that inclusion chemistry differs 
significantly from intercrystalline brines, indicating that fluid movement is very limited.  
Satterfield et al. (2002) also concluded that the coarse halite cements found in certain beds of the 
Salado are synsedimentary, based on ionic concentrations in fluid inclusions.  Moreover, 
Beauheim and Roberts (2002) find extremely low permeability in Salado halite, showing that 
fluid movement, especially vertically, through the Salado is too limited and slow to create the

purported recrystallization.  These findings are also consistent with indications that salt pan 
deposits are cemented quickly and thoroughly at shallow depths of burial (Casas and Lowenstein 
1989).  The conclusion that Salado halite has not been pervasively recrystallized remains sound.

The Salado is of primary importance to the containment of waste.  Because it is the principal 
natural barrier, many of the properties of the Salado have been characterized by the DOE, and 
numerical codes are used by the DOE to simulate the natural processes within the Salado that 
affect the disposal system performance.

Two conceptual models of the Salado are used in the performance assessment.  One models the 
creep closure properties of the Salado and the other, the hydrological properties.  The creep 
closure of the Salado is discussed in Appendix PA, Attachment PORSURF.  This model uses key 
parameters derived from both in-situ measurements and laboratory testing on Salado core 
samples.  Summaries of these parameters are in Butcher (1997). Appendix PORSURF

The second conceptual model is titled the Salado conceptual model and is discussed in Section 
6.4.5.  This model divides the Salado into two lithologic units:  impure halite and Salado 
interbeds.  The impure halite in this conceptual model is characterized entirely by its 
hydrological parameters as shown in Table 6-16.  The interbeds are characterized by both 
hydrological parameters in Table 6-17 and fracture properties in Table 6-19.  This latter 
information is needed since the model in Section 6.4.5.2 incorporates the possibility of interbed 
fracturing should pressures in the repository become high enough.  The modeling assumptions 
surrounding the fracturing model are discussed in Appendix PA, Attachment MASS, Section 
MASS-13.

The Rustler is the youngest evaporite-bearing formation in the Delaware Basin.  It was originally 
named by Richardson in 1904 for outcrops in the Rustler Hills of Culberson County, Texas.  
Adams (1944, p. 1614) first used the names Culebra Member and Magenta Member to describe 
the two carbonates in the formation, indicating that Lang favored the names, although Lang did 
not use these names to subdivide the Rustler in his 1942 publication.  Vine (1963, p. B1) 
extensively described the Rustler in Nash Draw and proposed the four formal names and one 
informal term that were used for the stratigraphic subdivisions of the Rustler.  These are as 
follows (from the base):  unnamed lower member, Culebra Dolomite Member, Tamarisk 
Member, Magenta Dolomite Member, and Forty-niner Member (Figure 2-14). Powers and Holt 
(1999) formalized the nomenclature for the lower Rustler, naming the Los Medaños Member for 
the exposures of the former “unnamed lower member” in the WIPP shafts and in boreholes in the 
vicinity of Los Medaños near the WIPP site. Four studies of the Rustler since Vine’s 1963 work 
contribute important information about the stratigraphy, sedimentology, and regional 
relationships while examining more local details as well.  Eager (1983) published a report on 
relationships of the Rustler observed in the southern Delaware Basin as part of sulfur exploration 
in the area.  Holt and Powers (1988, Section 5.0), reproduced

The Rustler is regionally extensive; a similar unit in the Texas panhandle is also called the 
Rustler. Within the area around WIPP, evaporite units of the Rustler are interbedded with 
significant siliciclastic beds and the carbonates.  Both the Magenta and the Culebra extend 
regionally beyond areas of direct interest to the WIPP.  In the general area of the WIPP, both the 
Tamarisk and the Forty-niner have similar lithologies:  lower and upper sulfate beds and a 
middle unit that varies principally from mudstone to halite from west to east (Figure 2-14).  In a 
general sense, halite in the Los Medaños broadly persists to the west of the WIPP site, and halite 
is found east of the center of the WIPP in the Tamarisk and the Forty-niner (Figure 2-15).

Two different explanations have been proposed over the history of the project to account for the 
observed distribution of halite in the non-dolomite members of the Rustler.  The earliest 
researchers (e.g., Bachman [1985] and Snyder [1985]) assumed that halite had originally been 
present in all the non-sulfate intervals of the Forty-niner, Tamarisk, and Los Medaños Members, 
and that its present-day absence reflected post-depositional dissolution.

An alternative interpretation was presented by Holt and Powers (1988) following detailed 
mapping of the Rustler exposed in the WIPP ventilation (now waste) and exhaust shafts in 1984.  
Fossils, sedimentological features, and bedding relationships were identified in units that had 
previously been interpreted from boreholes as dissolution residues. Cores from existing 
boreholes, outcrops, geophysical logs, and petrographic data were also reexamined to establish 
facies variability across the area.

As a result of these studies, the Rustler was interpreted to have formed in variable depositional 
environments, including lagoon and saline playas, with two major episodes of marine flooding 
which produced the carbonate units.  Sedimentary structures were interpreted to indicate 
synsedimentary dissolution of halite from halitic mudstones around a saline playa and fluvial 
transport of more distal clastic sediments.  The halite in the Rustler, by this interpretation, has a 
present-day distribution similar to that at the time the unit was deposited.  Some localized 
dissolution of halite may have occurred along the depositional margins, but not over large areas.  
Hence, the absence of halite in Rustler members at the WIPP site more generally reflects non-
deposition than dissolution.

This hypothesis was tested and refined by subsequent investigations (e.g., Powers and Holt 1990, 
1999, 2000; Holt and Powers 1990a) and is now considered the accepted explanation for the 
present-day distribution of halite in the Rustler.  Powers and Holt (1999) thoroughly described 
the sedimentary structures and stratigraphy of the Los Medaños as part of the procedure for 
naming the unit.  This shows the basis for interpreting the depositional history of the member 
and for rejecting significant post-burial dissolution of halite in that unit.  Powers and Holt (2000) 
further describe the lateral facies relationships in other Rustler units, especially the Tamarisk, 
developed on sedimentologic grounds, and rejected the concept of broad, lateral dissolution of 
halite from the Rustler across the WIPP site area.

As discussed in Section 2.2.1.4, regional Culebra transmissivity shows about six orders of 
magnitude variation across the area around the site and about three orders of magnitude across 
the site itself.  Although some investigators have called attention to the broad relationship 
between the distribution of halite in the Rustler and variations in Culebra transmissivity and have 
attributed the variation to fracturing resulting from postdepositional dissolution of Rustler halite 
(see, for example, Snyder 1985, p. 10; and CCA Appendix DEF, Section DEF-3.2), CCA 
Appendix FAC and Powers and Holt 1990, 1999, 2000) largely rule out this explanation.  
Variations in transmissivity of the Culebra were correlated qualitatively to the thickness of 
overburden above the Culebra (see discussion in Section 2.1.5.2), the amount of dissolution of 
the upper Salado, and the distribution of gypsum fillings in fractures in the Culebra (Beauheim 
and Holt 1990).  Subsequently, Holt and Yarbrough (2002) and Powers et al. (2003) related the 
variation in Culebra transmissivity more quantitatively to overburden thickness and dissolution 
of upper Salado halite. The DOE believes that variations in Culebra transmissivity are primarily 
caused by the relative abundance of open fractures in the unit, which may be related to each of 
these factors.  As discussed in Section 6.4.6.2 and Appendix PA, Attachment TFIELD, 
uncertainty in spatial variability in the transmissivity of the Culebra has been incorporated in the 
PA.

In the region around the WIPP, the Rustler reaches a maximum thickness of more than 152 m 
(500 ft) (Figure 2-16), while it is about 91 to 107 m (300 to 350 ft) thick within most of the 
WIPP site.  Much of the difference in Rustler thickness can be attributed to variations in the 
amount of halite contained in the formation.  Variation in Tamarisk thickness accounts for a 
larger part of thickness changes than do variations in either the Los Medaños or the Forty-niner.  
Details of the Rustler thickness can be found in CCA Appendix GCR, 4-39 to 4-42 and Figure 
4.3-8.  See also CCA Appendix FAC.

Much project-specific information about the Rustler is contained in CCA Appendix FAC.  The 
WIPP shafts were a crucial element in Holt and Powers’ 1988 study, exposing features not 
previously reported.  Cores were available from several WIPP boreholes, and their lithologies 
were matched to geophysical log signatures to extend the interpretation throughout a larger area 
in southeastern New Mexico.  These data are included in CCA Appendix FAC, Appendix II.

The unit formerly referred to as the unnamed lower member has been named the Los Medaños 
Member. The  Los Medaños rests on the Salado with apparent conformity at the WIPP site.  It 
consists of significant proportions of bedded and burrowed siliciclastic sedimentary rocks with 
cross-bedding and fossil remains.  These beds record the transition from strongly evaporative 
environments of the Salado to saline lagoonal environments.  The upper part of the  Los 
Medaños includes halitic and sulfatic beds within clastics. CCA Appendix FAC, pp. 6-8 and 
Powers and Holt (1999) interpret these as facies changes within a saline playa or lagoon 
environment, not dissolution residues from postdepositional dissolution. 
10 
11 
12 
13 
According to CCA Appendix FAC, Figure 4-4, the Los Medaños ranges in thickness from about 
29 to 38 m (96 to 126 ft) within the site boundaries. The maximum thickness recorded during 
that study was 63 m (208 ft) southeast of the WIPP site.  An isopach of the Los Medaños is 
shown as Figure 4-7 in CCA Appendix FAC.

Halite is present in the M1/H1 unit of the Los Medaños west of most of the site area (see Figure 
2-15 for an illustration of the halite margins).  The drilling initiated during CRA-2004 
preparation to investigate Culebra transmissivity variations based on overburden and Salado 
dissolution will develop additional detailed information about distribution of halite in the Los 
Medaños.  Cross-sections based on geophysical log interpretations by Holt and Powers (CCA 
Appendix FAC) and Powers and Holt (2000) show that the unit is thicker to the east where the 
halite is more abundant. The Los Medaños is incorporated into the conceptual model as 
described in Section 6.4.6.1.  Model parameters are in Appendix PA, Attachment PAR, Table 
PAR- 27.

The Culebra rests with apparent conformity on the Los Medaños, though the underlying unit 
ranges from claystone to its lateral halitic equivalent in the site area.  West of the WIPP site, in 
Nash Draw, the Culebra is disrupted from dissolution of underlying halite.  Holt and Powers 
(CCA Appendix FAC, Section 8.9.3) principally attribute this to dissolution of Salado halite, 
noting the presence of sedimentologic features in the lower Rustler (see also Powers and Holt 
1999).  Culebra hydrology and its significance to disposal system performance are discussed in 
detail in Section 2.2.1.4.1.2.

The Culebra was described by Robinson and Lang (1938, p. 83) as a dolomite 11 m (35  ft) in 
thickness.  The Culebra is generally brown, finely crystalline, locally argillaceous and 
arenaceous dolomite with rare to abundant vugs with variable gypsum and anhydrite filling; 
Adams (1944, p. 1614) noted that oölites are present in some outcrops as well.  Holt and Powers 
(CCA Appendix FAC, pp. 5 - 11) describe the Culebra features in detail, noting that most of the 
Culebra is microlaminated to thinly laminated, while some zones display no depositional fabric.  
Holt and Powers (1984) described an upper interval of the Culebra consisting of medium brown, 
microlaminated carbonate that thickens up to 0.6 m (2 ft) in the vicinity of dome structures and is 
of probable algal origin.  This is underlain by a 0.64-to 2.54-cm (0.25-to-1-in) thick bed of 
cohesive black claystone.  Because of the unique organic composition of this thin layer, Holt and 
Powers (1988) did not include it in the Culebra for thickness computations, and this will be

factored into discussions of Culebra thickness.  Based on core descriptions from the WIPP 
project, Holt and Powers (CCA Appendix FAC) concluded that there is very little variation of 
depositional sedimentary features throughout the Culebra.

Vugs are an important part of Culebra porosity.  They are commonly zoned parallel to bedding.  
In outcrop, vugs are commonly empty.  In the subsurface, vugs range from open to partially 
filled or filled with anhydrite, gypsum, or clay (Holt and Powers 1990a, pp. 3-18 to 3-20).  
Lowenstein (1987, pp. 19 - 20) noted similar features.  Holt and Powers (CCA Appendix FAC) 
attributed vugs partly to syndepositional growth as nodules and partly as later replacive textures.  
Lowenstein (1987, pp. 29 - 31) also described textures related to later replacement and alteration 
of sulfates.  Vug or pore fillings vary across the WIPP site and contribute to the porosity 
structure of the Culebra.  As pointed out by Holt and Powers (see CCA Appendix FAC, Section 
8.8), natural fractures filled with gypsum are common east of the WIPP site center and in a 
smaller area west of the site center (Figure 2-17).  Section 2.1.5.2 discusses Culebra fracture 
mechanisms.  Additional discussion of Culebra fractures and their role in groundwater flow and 
transport is in Section 2.2.1.4.1.1, Appendix PA, Attachment MASS, Sections MASS.14.4 and 
MASS.15.

Holt (1997) reexamined geological and hydrological data for the Culebra and developed a 
conceptual model for transport processes.  In this document, Holt (1997) recognized several 
porosity types for the Culebra, and separated four Culebra units (CU) informally designated CU-
1 through CU-4 from top to bottom.  CU-1 differs from underlying units because it has been 
disrupted very little by syndepositional processes.  Microvugs and interbeds provide most of the 
porosity, and the permeability of CU-1 is relatively limited. CU-2 and CU-3 likely contribute 
most of the flow in the Culebra, and the significant difference is that CU-2 includes more 
persistent silty dolomite interbeds.  CU-2 and CU-3 include “small-scale bedding-plane 
fractures, networks of randomly oriented small-scale fractures and microfractures, discontinuous 
silty dolomite interbeds, large vugs hydraulically connected with microfractures and small-scale 
fractures, microvugs hydraulically connected with microfractures and intercrystalline porosity, 
blebs of silty dolomite interconnected with microfractures and intercrystalline porosity, and 
intercrystalline porosity” (Holt 1997, p. 2-19).  Bedding-plane fractures dominate CU-4 at the 
base of the Culebra, and the unit shows some brittle deformation.  CU-4 has not been isolated for 
hydraulic testing. 
32 
33 
34 
35 
36 
Holt (1997, p. I) also related porosity and solute transport, conceptualizing the medium “as 
consisting of advective porosity, where solutes are carried by the groundwater flow, and fracture-
bounded zones of diffusive porosity, where solutes move through slow advection or diffusion.”  
Holt (1997) noted that length or time scales will govern how each porosity type will contribute to 
solute transport. 
37

Sewards et al. (1991, pp. IX-1) report that the Culebra is primarily dolomite with some quartz 
and clay.  Clay minerals include corrensite, illite, serpentine, and chlorite.  Clay occurs in bulk

In the WIPP area, the Culebra varies in thickness.  Depending on the area considered and the 
horizons chosen for the upper and lower boundaries of the Culebra, different data sources 
provide varying estimates (Table 2-3).  Holt and Powers (CCA Appendix FAC, p. 4-4) 
considered the organic-rich layer at the Culebra-Tamarisk contact separately from the Culebra in 
interpreting geophysical logs.

9 
10 
11 
Comparing data sets, Holt and Powers (CCA Appendix FAC) typically interpret the Culebra as 
being about 1 m (about 3 ft) thinner than do other interpretations.  In general, this reflects the 
difference between including or excluding the unit at the Culebra-Tamarisk contact. The isopach 
of the Culebra is shown as Figure 4.8 in CCA Appendix FAC. 
12 
13 
14 
15 
LaVenue et al. (1988, Table B.1) calculated a mean thickness of 7.7 m (25  ft) for the Culebra 
within their model domain based on thicknesses measured in 78 boreholes.  Mercer (1983, 
reproduced as CCA Appendix HYDRO) reported a data set similar to that of LaVenue et al.  The 
borehole database for the region of interest is provided in CCA Appendix BH.

The Tamarisk is generally conformable with the underlying Culebra.  The transition is marked 
by an organic-rich unit interpreted as being present over most of southeastern New Mexico.  The 
Tamarisk around the WIPP site consists of lower and upper sulfate units separated by a unit that 
varies from mudstone (generally to the west) to mainly halite (to the east).  Near the center of the 
WIPP site, the lower anhydrite was partially eroded during deposition of the middle mudstone 
unit, as observed in the WIPP waste-handling and exhaust shafts.  The lower anhydrite was 
completely eroded at WIPP-19.  Before shaft exposures were available, the lack of the Lower 
Tamarisk anhydrite at WIPP-19 was interpreted as the result of dissolution and the mudstone was 
considered a cave filling. 
12 
13 
14 
15 
16 
Jones (1978) interprets halite to be present east of the center of the WIPP site based on 
geophysical logs and drill cuttings.  Based mainly on cores and cuttings records from the WIPP 
potash drilling program, Snyder prepared a map showing the halitic areas of each of the 
noncarbonate members of the Rustler (Snyder 1985, Figure 4).  A very similar map based on 
geophysical log characteristics was prepared by Holt and Powers (1988). 
17 
18 
19 
20 
CCA Appendix FAC describes the mudstones and halitic facies in the middle of the Tamarisk 
and postulate that the unit formed in a salt-pan-to-mudflat system.  Powers and Holt (2000) cited 
sedimentary features and the lateral relationships as evidence of syndepositional dissolution of 
halite in the marginal mudflat areas.  
21 
22 
23 
24 
25 
26 
The Tamarisk thickness varies greatly in southeastern New Mexico, principally as a function of 
the thickness of halite in the middle unit.  Within T22S, R31E, the thickness ranges from 26 to 
56 m (84 to 184 ft) for the entire Tamarisk and from 2 to 34 m (6 to 110 ft) for the interval of 
mudstone-halite between lower and upper anhydrites (CCA Appendix FAC, Figures 4-9 and 4-
11).  Expanded geophysical logs with corresponding lithology illustrate some of the lateral 
relationships for this interval (Figure 2-18; see also Powers and Holt 2000).

developed algal features.  It does not vary greatly in sedimentary features

Vine (1963) named the Forty-niner for outcrops at Forty-niner Ridge in eastern Nash Draw, but 
the unit is poorly exposed there.  In the subsurface around the WIPP, the Forty-niner consists of 
basal and upper sulfates separated by a mudstone.  It is conformable with the underlying 
Magenta.  As with other members of the Rustler, geophysical log characteristics can be 
correlated with core and shaft descriptions to extend geological inferences across a large area 
(Holt and Powers 1988).

The Forty-niner varies from 13 to 23 m (43 to 77 ft) thick within T22S, R31E.  East and 
southeast of the WIPP, the Forty-niner exceeds 24 m (80 ft), and some of the geophysical logs 
from this area indicate that halite is present in the beds between the sulfates. A regional isopach 
map of the Forty-niner is in CCA Appendix FAC (Figure 4-13).  See also Powers and Holt 
(2000).

Within the waste-handling shaft, the Forty-niner mudstone displayed sedimentary features and 
bedding relationships indicating sedimentary transport.  These beds are not known to have been 
described in detail prior to mapping in the waste-handling shaft at WIPP, and the features found 
there led Holt and Powers (CCA Appendix FAC) to reexamine the available evidence for, and 
interpretations of, dissolution of halite in Rustler units.

The inclusion of the Forty-niner in the conceptual model is discussed in Section 6.4.6.5.

2.1.3.6 The Dewey Lake

The nomenclature for rocks included in the Dewey Lake Formation was introduced during the 
1960s to clarify relationships between these rocks assigned to the Upper Permian and the 
Cenozoic Gatuña Formation.

There are three main sources of data about the Dewey Lake in the area around WIPP.  Miller 
reported the petrology of the unit in 1955 and 1966.  Schiel (1988) described outcrops in the 
Nash Draw areas and interpreted geophysical logs of the unit in southeastern New Mexico and 
west Texas to infer the depositional environments and stratigraphic relationships in 1988 and 
1994.  Holt and Powers (1990a) were able to describe the Dewey Lake in detail at the AIS for 
WIPP in 1990, confirming much of Schiel’s (1988) information and adding data regarding the 
Lower Dewey Lake.

The Dewey Lake overlies the Rustler conformably, though local examples of the contact (for 
example, the AIS described by Holt and Powers (1990a) show minor disruption by dissolution of 
some of the upper Rustler sulfate.  The formation is predominantly reddish-brown fine sandstone

bedding, and larger channeling are common features in outcrops, and additional soft sediment 
deformation features and early fracturing from the lower part of the formation are described by 
Holt and Powers (1990a).  Schiel (1988, p. 143; 1994, p. 9) attributed the Dewey Lake to 
deposition on “a large, arid fluvial plain subject to ephemeral flood events.”

There is no direct faunal or radiometric evidence of the age of the Dewey Lake in the vicinity of 
the WIPP site.  It is assigned to the Ochoan Series, considered historically to be Late Permian in 
age, and it is regionally correlated with units of similar lithology and stratigraphic position.  
Schiel (1988, 1994) reviewed the limited radiometric data from lithologically similar rocks 
(Quartermaster Formation) and concluded that much of the unit could be Early Triassic in age.  
Renne et al. (1996) resampled tephra from the Quartermaster in the Texas panhandle area and 
found that radiometric data support the idea that the Quartermaster is mainly Triassic in age 
rather than Permian.  Others have begun to infer as well that the Dewey Lake in the vicinity of 
the WIPP may be mostly Triassic (e.g., Powers and Holt 1999).  These age relationships 
continue to be of academic interest because of the geologic significance of the Permo-Triassic 
boundary, but there is no significance for waste isolation at the WIPP.

Near the center of the WIPP site, Holt and Powers (1990a, Figure 5) mapped 152 m (498 ft) of 
the Dewey Lake (Figure 2-19).  The formation is thicker to the east (Schiel 1994, Figure 2) of the 
WIPP site, in part because western areas were eroded before the overlying Triassic rocks were 
deposited.

The Dewey Lake contains fractures, which are filled with minerals to varying degrees.  Both 
cements and fracture fillings have been examined and used to infer groundwater infiltration.  
Holt and Powers (1990a, pp. 3-10) described the Dewey Lake as cemented by carbonate above 
50 m (164.5 ft) in the AIS; some fractures in the lower part of this interval were also filled with 
carbonate, and the entire interval surface was commonly moist.  Below this point, the cement is 
harder and more commonly anhydrite (Powers 2003b), the shaft is dry, and fractures are filled 
with gypsum.  Powers (2002c; 2003b) reports core and geophysical log data supporting these 
vertical changes in natural mineral cements in the Dewey Lake over a larger region at a horizon 
that is believed to underlie known natural groundwater occurrences in the Dewey Lake.  In areas 
where the Dewey Lake has been exposed to weathering after erosion of the overlying Santa 
Rosa, this cement boundary tends to generally parallel the eroded upper surface of the Dewey 
Lake, suggesting that weathering has affected the location of the boundary.  Where the Dewey 
Lake has been protected by overlying rocks of the Santa Rosa, the cement change appears to be 
stratigraphically controlled but the data points are too few to be certain.  Holt and Powers 
(1990a, pp. 3 - 11, Figure 16) suggested that the cement change might be related to infiltration of 
meteoric water.  They also determined that some of the gypsum-filled fractures are 
syndepositional.  Dewey Lake fractures include horizontal to subvertical trends, some of which 
were mapped in detail (Holt and Powers 1986, Figures 6, 7, and 8).

Lambert (1991, pp. 5 - 65) analyzed the deuterium/hydrogen (D/H) ratios of gypsum in the 
Rustler and gypsum veins in the Dewey Lake.  He suggest that none of the gypsum formed from 
evaporitic fluid such as Permian seawater but that the D/H ratios all show influence of meteoric 
water.  Furthermore, Lambert (1991, 5 – 66) infers that the gypsum D/H ratio is not consistent 
with modern meteoric water; it may, however, be consistent with older meteoric fluids.  There is 
no obvious correlation with depth to indicate infiltration.  Strontium isotope ratios (

indicate no intermixing or homogenization of fluids between the Rustler and the Dewey Lake, 
but there may have been lateral movement of water within the Dewey Lake (Lambert 1991, pp. 
5 - 54).  Dewey Lake carbonate-vein material shows a broader range of strontium ratios than 
does surface caliche, and the ratios barely overlap.

The treatment of the Dewey Lake in the conceptual model can be found in Section 6.4.6.6.  
Dewey Lake parameter values are in Table 6-25.

14 
15 
16

18 
There have been different approaches to the nomenclature of rocks of Triassic age in 
southeastern New Mexico.  Bachman (1974) generally described the units as “Triassic, 
undivided” or as the Dockum Group, without dividing it.  Vine (1963) used “Santa Rosa 
Sandstone,” and Santa Rosa has become common usage.  Lucas and Anderson (1993a, 1993b) 
import other formation names that are unlikely to be useful for WIPP. 
19 
20 
21 
22 
The Santa Rosa has been called disconformable over the Dewey Lake by Vine (1963, B25).  
These rocks have more variegated hues than the underlying uniformly colored Dewey Lake.  
Coarse-grained rocks, including conglomerates, are common, and the formation includes a 
variety of cross-bedding and sedimentary features (Lucas and Anderson 1993a, pp. 231 - 235).

Within the WIPP site boundary, the Santa Rosa is relatively thin to absent (Figure 2-20).  At the 
AIS, Holt and Powers (1990a, Figure 5) attributed about 0.6 m (2 ft) of rock to the Santa Rosa.  
The Santa Rosa is a maximum of 78 m (255 ft) thick in potash holes drilled for WIPP east of the 
site boundary.  The Santa Rosa is thicker to the east.  The geologic data from design studies 
(Sergent et al. 1979) were incorporated with data from drilling to investigate shallow subsurface 
water in the Santa Rosa to provide structure and thickness maps of the Santa Rosa in the vicinity 
of the WIPP surface structures area (Powers 1997).  These results are consistent with the broader 
regional distribution of the Santa Rosa. 
31 
32 
33 
The Santa Rosa and younger rocks are modeled in the WIPP PA as a single region as discussed 
in Section 6.4.6.7.  The model parameters for this supra-Dewey Lake region are given in Table 
6-26.

Lang (in Robinson and Lang 1938, p. 84) named the Gatuña for outcrops in the vicinity of 
Gatuña Canyon in the Clayton Basin.  Rocks now attributed to the Gatuña in Pierce Canyon were 
once included in the Pierce Canyon Formation with rocks now assigned to the Dewey Lake.  The

Vine (1963) and Bachman (1974) provided some limited description of the Gatuña.  The most 
comprehensive study of the Gatuña is based on WIPP investigations and landfill studies for the 
City of Carlsbad and Eddy County (Powers and Holt 1993).  Much of the formation is colored 
light reddish-brown.  It is broadly similar to the Dewey Lake and the Santa Rosa, though the 
older units have more intense hues.  The formation is highly variable, ranging from coarse 
conglomerates to claystones with some highly gypsiferous sections.  Sedimentary structures are 
abundant.  Analysis of lithofacies indicates that the formation is dominantly fluvial in origin with 
areas of low-energy deposits and evaporitic minerals.

The thickness of the Gatuña is not very consistent regionally, as shown in Figure 2-21.  The 
thickness of the Gatuña ranges up to 91 m (300 ft) at Pierce Canyon, with thicker areas generally 
subparallel to the Pecos River.  To the east, the Gatuña is thin or absent.  Holt and Powers 
(1990a) reported about 2.7 m (9 ft) of undisturbed Gatuña in the AIS at WIPP.  Powers (1997) 
integrated data from facility design geotechnical work (Sergent et al. 1979) and drilling to 
investigate shallow water to develop maps of the Gatuña in the vicinity of the WIPP surface 
facility.  These maps are consistent with the broader regional view of the distribution of the 
Gatuña.

The Gatuña has been considered Pleistocene in age based on a volcanic glass in the Upper 
Gatuña along the eastern margin of Nash Draw that has been identified as the Lava Creek B ash, 
dated at 0.6 million years by Izett and Wilcox (1982).  This upper-limit age is corroborated by 
the age determinations from the Mescalero caliche (hereafter referred to as the Mescalero) that 
overlies the Gatuña (see Section 2.1.3.9).  An additional volcanic ash from the Gatuña in Texas 
yields consistent K-Ar and geochemical data, indicating that it is about 13 million years old at 
that location (Powers and Holt 1993, p. 271).  Thus, the Gatuña ranges in age over a period of 
time that may be greater than that spanned by the Ogallala Formation (hereafter referred to as the 
Ogallala) on the High Plains east of WIPP.

The Mescalero caliche is an informal stratigraphic unit apparently first differentiated by 
Bachman in 1974, though Bachman (1973, p. 17, p. 27) described the caliche on the Mescalero 
Plain.  He differentiated the Mescalero from the older, widespread  Ogallala caliche or caprock 
on the basis of textures, noting that breccia and pisolitic textures are much more common in the 
Ogallala caliche.  The Mescalero has been noted over significant areas in the Pecos drainage, 
including the WIPP area, and it has been formed over a variety of substrates. Bachman (1973) 
described the Mescalero as a two-part unit:  (1) an upper dense laminar caprock and (2) a basal, 
earthy-to-firm, nodular calcareous deposit.  Machette (1985, p. 5) classified the Mescalero as 
having Stage V morphologies of a calcic soil (the more mature Ogallala caprock that occurs east 
of the WIPP site reaches Stage VI).

Bachman (1976, Figure 8) provided structure contours on the Mescalero caliche for a large area 
of southeastern New Mexico, including the WIPP site.  From the contours and Bachman’s 
discussion of the Mescalero as a soil, it is clear that the Mescalero is expected to be continuous 
over large areas.  Explicit WIPP data are limited mainly to boreholes, though some borehole 
reports do not mention the Mescalero.  The unit may be as much as 3 m (10 ft) thick.

The Mescalero overlies the Gatuña and was interpreted by Bachman (1976) on basic 
stratigraphic grounds as having accumulated during the early-to-middle Pleistocene.  Samples of 
the Mescalero from the vicinity of the WIPP were studied using uranium-trend methods.

Based on early written communication from Rosholt, Bachman (1985, p. 20) reports that the 
basal Mescalero began to form about 510,000 years ago and the upper part began to form about 
410,000 years ago; these ages are commonly cited in WIPP literature.  The samples are 
interpreted by Rosholt and McKinney (1980, Table 5) in the formal report as indicating ages of 
570,000 ± 110,000 years for the lower part of the Mescalero and 420,000 ± 60,000 years for the 
upper part.

According to Bachman (1985, p. 19), where the Mescalero is flat-lying and not breached by 
erosion, it is an indicator of stability or integrity of the land surface over the last 500,000 years.  
An additional discussion of the Mescalero caliche can be found in CCA Appendix GCR, Section 
4.2.2.

Soils of the region have developed mainly from Quaternary and Permian parent material.  Parent 
material from the Quaternary System is represented by alluvial deposits of major streams, dune 
sand, and other surface deposits.  These are mostly loamy and sandy sediments containing some 
coarse fragments.  Parent material from the Permian System is represented by limestone, 
dolomite, and gypsum bedrock.  Soils of the region have developed in a semiarid, continental 
climate with abundant sunshine, low relative humidity, erratic and low rainfall, and a wide 
variation in daily and seasonal temperatures.  Subsoil colors are normally light brown to reddish 
brown but are often mixed with lime accumulations (caliche) that result from limited, erratic 
rainfall and insufficient leaching.

A soil association is a landscape with a distinctive pattern of soil types (series).  It normally 
consists of one or more major soils and at least one minor soil.  There are three soil associations 
within 8.3 km (5 mi) of the WIPP site: the Kermit-Berino, the Simona-Pajarito, and the Pyote-
Maljamar-Kermit.  Of these three associations, only the Kermit-Berino soil series has been 
mapped across the WIPP site by Chugg et al. (1952, Sheet No. 113).  These are sandy soils 
developed on eolian material.  The Kermit-Berino soils include active dune areas.  The Berino 
soil has a sandy A horizon; the B horizons include more argillaceous material and weak-to-
moderate soil structures.  A and B horizons are described as noncalcareous, and the underlying C 
horizon is commonly caliche.  Bachman (1980, p. 44) interpreted the Berino soil as a paleosol 
that is a remnant B horizon of the underlying Mescalero.  Rosholt and McKinney (1980, Table 5) 
applied uranium-trend methods to samples of the Berino soil from the WIPP site area.  Rosholt 
and McKinney (1980) interpreted the age of formation of the Berino soil as 330,000 ± 75,000 
years.

Generally, the Berino Series, which covers about 50 percent of the site, consists of deep, 
noncalcareous, yellow-red to red sandy soils that developed from wind-worked material of 
mixed origin.  These soils are described as undulating to hummocky and gently sloping (zero to 
three percent slopes).  The soils are the most extensive of the deep, sandy soils in the Eddy 
County area.  Berino soils are subject to continuing wind and water erosion.  If the vegetative

cover is seriously depleted, the water-erosion potential is slight, but the wind-erosion potential is 
very high.  These soils are particularly sensitive to wind erosion in the months of March, April, 
and May, when rainfall is minimal and winds are highest.  These soil characteristics are a 
consideration for the design of long-term passive controls such as monuments and markers (see 
CCA Appendix PIC, Section III).

The Kermit Series consists of deep, light-colored, noncalcareous, excessively drained loose 
sands, typically yellowish-red fine sand.  The surface is undulating to billowy (from 0 to 
3 percent slopes) and consists mostly of stabilized sand dunes.  Kermit soils are slightly to 
moderately eroded.  Permeability is very high, and, if vegetative cover is removed, the water-
erosion potential is slight, but the wind-erosion potential is very high.

Surface soils appear to play a role in the infiltration of precipitation.  Mercer (CCA Appendix 
HYDRO) points out that where surface deposits are thickest, they may contain localized perched 
zones of groundwater.  A more thorough discussion of this topic can be found in CCA Appendix 
HYDRO.

The stratigraphy and lithology at the WIPP site has been summarized from the lowermost pre-
Cambrian units to the surface soils.  While these are important for an understanding of the site 
and its stability, not all of these units are important to the performance of the disposal system.  
As a result, the DOE has developed a conceptual model that describes the lithology as 13 
discrete model regions ranging from the Castile to a region that generally includes units above 
the Dewey Lake.  In this model, emphasis is placed on the Castile, the Salado, the five members 
of the Rustler, the Dewey Lake, and the supra-Dewey Lake units.  The Salado is divided into five 
stratigraphic units to capture the variations in properties near the horizon of the repository (see 
Figure 6-14).  The identification and definition of the appropriate modeling units is based on the 
identification of FEPs that can impact the performance of the disposal system.  Details of the 
conceptual model can be found in Section 6.4.2.

In this section, the DOE presents a discussion of the physiography and geomorphology of the 
WIPP site and surrounding area.  This information is taken from DOE 1980 (pp. 7-21 to 7-23).  
Geomorphology and physiography are determined by the DOE (1980) to be features that are 
potentially important to disposal system performance.  They are included in the consequence 
analysis through consideration of the topography and its influence on the regional water table.  
(See discussion of regional water table characteristics in Section 2.2.1.)  Consequently, 
topographic information is presented in this section.  In addition, several geomorphological 
processes have been screened out on the basis of either low consequence or low probability, as 
discussed in Appendix PA, Attachment SCR.  These include weathering, erosion, sedimentation, 
and soil development.  Information is presented in this section to support this screening.  In order 
to perform this screening, such factors as slopes, proximity to watercourses, dissection, and 
historic and existing processes are important.  These are presented in this section in terms of the 
regional and local physiographic and geomorphological characteristics.  Tectonic processes that 
may alter the physiography of the region or site area are discussed in Section 2.1.5.  In addition,

characterization as having the potential for affecting the repository over the longer term and as

The WIPP site is in the Pecos Valley section of the southern Great Plains physiographic province 
(Figure 2-22), a broad, highland belt sloping gently eastward from the Rocky Mountains and the 
Basin and Range Province to the Central Lowlands Province.  The Pecos Valley section itself is 
dominated by the Pecos River Valley, a long north-south trough that is from 8.3 to 50 km (5 to 
30 mi) wide and as much as 305 m (1,000 ft) deep in the north.  The Pecos River System has 
evolved from the south, cutting headward through the Ogallala sediments and becoming 
entrenched some time after the Middle Pleistocene.  It receives almost all the surface and 
subsurface drainage of the region; most of its tributaries are intermittent because of the semiarid 
climate.  The surface locally has a karst terrain containing sinkholes, dolines, and solution-
subsidence troughs from both surface erosion and subsurface dissolution.  The valley has an 
uneven rock- and alluvium-covered floor with widespread solution-subsidence features, the 
result of dissolution in the underlying Upper Permian rocks.  The terrain varies from plains and 
lowlands to rugged canyonlands, and contains such erosional features as scarps, cuestas, terraces, 
and mesas.  The surface slopes gently eastward, reflecting the underlying rock strata.  Elevations 
vary from more than 1,829 m (6,000 ft) in the northwest to about 610 m (2,000 ft) in the south.

The Pecos Valley section is bordered on the east by the virtually uneroded plain of the Llano 
Estacado.  The Llano Estacado is part of the High Plains section of the Great Plains 
physiographic province and is a poorly drained eastward-sloping surface covered by gravels, 
wind-blown sand, and caliche that has developed since early-to-middle Pleistocene time.  Few 
and minor topographic features are present in the High Plains section, formed when more than 
152 m (500 ft) of Tertiary silts, gravels, and sands were laid down in alluvial fans by streams 
draining the Rocky Mountains.  In many areas, the nearly flat surface is cemented by a hard 
caliche layer.

To the west of the Pecos Valley section are the Sacramento Mountains and the Guadalupe 
Mountains, part of the Sacramento section of the Basin and Range Province.  The Capitan 
escarpment along the southeastern side of the Guadalupe Mountains marks the boundary 
between the Basin and Range and the Great Plains provinces.  The Sacramento section has large 
basinal areas and a series of intervening mountain ranges (DOE 1980).

The land surface in the area of the WIPP site is a semiarid, wind-blown plain sloping gently to 
the west and southwest, and is hummocky with sand ridges and dunes.  A hard caliche layer 
(Mescalero rocks) is typically present beneath the sand blanket and on the surface of the 
underlying Gatuña.  Figure 2-23 is a topographic map of the area.  Elevations at the site range 
from 1,088 m (3,570 ft) in the east to 990 m (3,250 ft) in the west.  The average east-to-west 
slope is 9.4 m per kilometer (50 ft/mi).

Livingston Ridge is the most prominent physiographic feature near the site.  It is a west-facing 
escarpment that has about 23 m (75 ft) of topographic relief and marks the eastern edge of Nash 
Draw, the drainage course nearest to the site (see Figure 2-23).  Nash Draw is a shallow 8-km-
wide (5-mi-wide) basin, 61 to 91 m (200 to 300 ft) deep and open to the southwest.  It was 
caused, at least in part, by subsurface dissolution and the accompanying subsidence of overlying 
sediments.  Livingston Ridge is the approximate boundary between terrain that has undergone 
erosion and/or solution collapse to the west and terrain that has been little affected to the east.

About 24 km (15 mi) east of the site is the southeast-trending San Simon Swale, a depression 
caused, at least in part, by subsurface dissolution.  Between San Simon Swale and the site is a 
broad, low mesa named the Divide.  Lying about 9.7 km (6 mi) east of the site and about 30 m 
(100 ft) above the surrounding terrain, it is a boundary between southwest drainage toward Nash 
Draw and southeast drainage toward San Simon Swale.  The Divide is capped by the Ogallala 
and the overlying caliche, upon which have formed small, elongated depressions similar to those 
in the adjacent High Plains section to the east.

Surface drainage is intermittent; the nearest perennial stream is the Pecos River, 19 km (12 mi) 
southwest of the WIPP site boundary.  The site’s location near a natural divide protects it from 
flooding and serious erosion caused by heavy runoff.  Should the climate become more humid, 
any perennial streams should follow the present basins, and Nash Draw and San Simon Swale 
would be the most eroded, leaving the area of the Divide relatively intact.

The DOE has screened out, on the basis of either probability or consequence or both, all tectonic, 
magmatic, and structural related processes.  The screening discussions can be found in Appendix 
PA, Attachment SCR.  The information needed for this screening is included here and covers 
regional tectonic processes such as subsidence and uplift and basin tilting, magmatic processes 
such as igneous intrusion and events such as volcanism, and structural processes such as faulting 
and loading and unloading of the rocks because of long-term sedimentation or erosion.  
Discussions of structural events, such as earthquakes, are considered to the extent that they may 
create new faults or activate old faults.  The seismicity of the area is considered in Section 2.6 for 
the purposes of determining seismic design parameters for the facility.

The processes and features included in this section are those more traditionally considered part of

different process that can develop some features resembling those of tectonics.

Most broad-scale structural elements of the area around the WIPP developed during the Late 
Paleozoic (CCA Appendix GCR, pp. 3-58 to 3-77).  There is little historical or geological 
evidence of significant tectonic activity in the vicinity, and the level of stress in the region is low.  
The entire region tilted slightly during the Tertiary, and activity related to Basin and Range 
tectonics formed major structures southwest of the area.  Seismic activity is specifically 
addressed in a separate section.

Broad subsidence began in the area as early as the Ordovician, developing a sag called the 
Tobosa Basin.  By Late Pennsylvanian to Early Permian time, the Central Basin Platform 
developed (Figure 2-24), separating the Tobosa Basin into two parts:  the Delaware Basin to the 
west and the Midland Basin to the east.  The Permian Basin refers to the collective set of 
depositional basins in the area during the Permian Period.  Southwest of the Delaware Basin, the 
Diablo Platform began developing either in the Late Pennsylvanian or Early Permian.  The 
Marathon Uplift and Ouachita tectonic belt limited the southern extent of the Delaware Basin.

According to Brokaw et al. (1972, p. 30), pre-Ochoan sedimentary rocks in the Delaware Basin 
show evidence of gentle downwarping during deposition, while Ochoan and younger rocks do 
not.  A relatively uniform eastward tilt, generally from about 14 to 19 m/per km (75 to 
100 ft/mi), has been superimposed on the sedimentary sequence.1   King (1948, pp. 108 and 121) 
generally attributes the uplift of the Guadalupe and Delaware mountains along the west side of 
the Delaware Basin to the later Cenozoic, though he also notes that some faults along the west 
margin of the Guadalupe Mountains have displaced Quaternary gravels.

King (1948, p. 144) also infers the uplift from the Pliocene-age deposits of the Llano Estacado.  
Subsequent studies of the  Ogallala of the Llano Estacado show that it varies in age from 
Miocene (about 12 million years before present) to Pliocene (Hawley 1993).  This is the most 
likely range for uplift of the Guadalupe Mountains and broad tilting to the east of the Delaware 
Basin sequence.

Analysis of the present regional stress field indicates that the Delaware Basin lies within the 
Southern Great Plains stress province.  This province is a transition zone between the extensional 
stress regime to the west and the region of compressive stress to the east.  An interpretation by 
Zoback and Zoback (1991, p. 350) of the available data indicates that the level of stress in the 
Southern Great Plains stress province is low.  Changes to the tectonic setting, such as the 
development of subduction zones and a consequent change in the driving forces, would take 
much longer than 10,000 years to occur.

To the west of the Southern Great Plains province is the Basin and Range province, or 
Cordilleran Extension province, where according to Zoback and Zoback (1991, pp. 348 - 351), 
normal faulting is the characteristic style of deformation.  The eastern boundary of the Basin and 
Range province is marked by the Rio Grande Rift.  Sanford et al. (1991, p. 230) note that, as a 
geological structure, the rift extends beyond the relatively narrow geomorphological feature seen 
at the surface, with a magnetic anomaly at least 500 km (300 mi) wide.  On this basis, the Rio 
Grande Rift can be regarded as a system of axial grabens along a major north-south trending 
structural uplift (a continuation of the Southern Rocky Mountains).  The magnetic anomaly 
extends beneath the Southern Great Plains stress province, and regional-scale uplift of about 
1,000 m (3,300 ft) over the past 10 million years also extends into eastern New Mexico.

26 
27 
To the east of the Southern Great Plains province is the large Mid-Plate province that 
encompasses central and eastern regions of the conterminous United States and the Atlantic 
basin west of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge.  The Mid-Plate province is characterized by low levels of 
paleo- and historic seismicity.  Where Quaternary faulting has occurred, it is generally strike-slip 
and appears to be associated with the reactivation of older structural elements.

33 
Zoback et al. (1991) report no stress measurements from the Delaware Basin.  The stress field in 
the Southern Great Plains stress province has been defined from borehole measurements in west 
Texas and from volcanic lineaments in northern New Mexico.  These measurements were 
interpreted by Zoback and Zoback (1991, p. 353) to indicate that the least principal horizontal 
stress is oriented north-northeast and south-southwest and that most of the province is 
characterized by an extensional stress regime.

There is an abrupt change between the orientation of the least principal horizontal stress in the 
Southern Great Plains and the west-northwest orientation of the least principal horizontal stress 
characteristic of the Rio Grande Rift.  In addition to the geological indications of a transition 
zone as described above, Zoback and Zoback (1980, p. 6134) point out that there is also evidence 
for a sharp boundary between these two provinces.  This is reinforced by the change in crustal 
thickness from about 40 km (24 mi) beneath the Colorado Plateau to about 50 km (30 mi) or 
more beneath the Southern Great Plains east of the Rio Grande Rift.  The base of the crust within 
the Rio Grande Rift is poorly defined but is shallower than that of the Colorado Plateau 
(Thompson and Zoback 1979, p. 152). There is also markedly lower heat flow in the Southern

On the eastern boundary of the Southern Great Plains province, there is only a small rotation in 
the direction of the least principal horizontal stress.  There is, however, a change from an 
extensional, normal faulting regime to a compressive, strike-slip faulting regime in the Mid-Plate 
province.  According to Zoback and Zoback (1980, p. 6134), the available data indicate that this 
change is not abrupt and that the Southern Great Plains province can be viewed as a marginal 
part of the Mid-Plate province.

2.1.5.2 Loading and Unloading

Loading and unloading during the geological history since deposition is considered an influence 
on the hydrology of the Permian units because of its possible effect on the development of 
fractures.

The sedimentary loading, depth of total burial, and erosion events combine in a complex history 
reconstructed here from regional geological trends and local data.  The history is presented in 
Figure 2-25 with several alternatives, depending on the inferences that are drawn, ranging from 
minimal to upper-bound estimates (Powers and Holt 1995, Section 5.3). Borns (1987) also made 
a generalized estimate of loading that is similar.  The estimates are made with a reference point 
and depth to the Culebra at the AIS.

Given the maximum local thickness of the Dewey Lake, the maximum load at the end of the 
Permian was no more than approximately 240 m (787 ft).  Given the present depth to the Culebra 
from the top of the Dewey Lake in the AIS, approximately 35 m (115 ft) of Dewey Lake might 
have been eroded during the Early Triassic before additional sediments were deposited.  The 
Triassic thickness at the AIS is approximately 8 m (26 ft).  Northeast of the WIPP site (T21S, 
R33E), Triassic rocks (Dockum Group) have a maximum local thickness of approximately 
373 m (1,233 ft).  This thickness is a reasonable estimate of the maximum thickness also attained 
at the WIPP site prior to the Jurassic Period.  At the end of the Triassic, the total thickness at the 
WIPP site may have then attained approximately 586 m (1,863 ft) in two similar loading stages 
of a few million years each, over a period of approximately 50 million years. 
29 
30 
The Jurassic outcrops nearest to the WIPP site are in the Malone Mountains of west Texas.  
There is no evidence that Jurassic rocks were deposited at or in the vicinity of the WIPP site. 
31 
32 
As a consequence, the Jurassic is considered a time of erosion or nondeposition at the site, 
though erosion is most likely. 
33 
34 
35 
36 
37 
38 
Widespread erosion during the Jurassic obviously cannot be broadly inferred for the area or there 
would not be thick Triassic rocks still preserved.  Triassic rocks of this thickness are preserved 
nearby, indicating either pre-Jurassic tilting or that erosion did not occur until later (but still after 
tilting to preserve the Triassic rocks near the WIPP site).  It is also possible that the immediate 
site area had little Triassic deposition or erosion, but very limited Triassic deposition (that is, 8 m 
[26 ft]) at the WIPP site seems unlikely.

Lang (1947) reported fossils from Lower Cretaceous rocks in the Black River Valley southwest 
of the WIPP site.  Bachman (1980, p. 28) also reported similar patches of probable Cretaceous 
rocks near Carlsbad and south of White’s City.  From these reports, it is likely that some 
Cretaceous rocks were deposited at the WIPP site.  Approximately 110 km (70 mi) south-
southwest of the WIPP site, significant Cretaceous outcrops of both Early and Late Cretaceous 
age have a total maximum thickness of approximately 300 m (1,000 ft).  Southeast of the WIPP, 
the nearest Cretaceous outcrops are thinner and represent only the Lower Cretaceous.  Based on 
outcrops, a maximum thickness of 300 m (1,000 ft) of Cretaceous rocks could be estimated for 
the WIPP site.  Compared to the estimate of Triassic rock thickness, it is less likely that 
Cretaceous rocks were this thick at the site.  The uppermost lines of Figure 2-25 summarize the 
assumptions of maximum thickness of these units.

A more likely alternative is that virtually no Cretaceous rocks were deposited, followed by 
erosion of remaining Triassic rocks during the Late Cretaceous to the Late Cenozoic.  Such 
erosion may also have taken place over an even longer period, beginning with the Jurassic 
Period.  Ewing (1993) favors Early Cretaceous uplift and erosion for the Trans-Pecos Texas area, 
but does not analyze later uplift and erosional patterns.

In the general vicinity of the WIPP site, there are outcrops of Cenozoic rock from the Late 
Miocene (Gatuña and Ogallala Formations).  There is little reason to infer any significant Early 
Cenozoic sediment accumulation at the WIPP site.  Erosion is the main process inferred to have 
occurred during this period and an average erosion rate of approximately 10 m (33 ft) per million 
years is sufficient during the Cenozoic to erode the maximum inferred Triassic and Cretaceous 
thickness prior to Gatuña and Ogallala deposition.  Significant thicknesses of Cretaceous rocks 
may not have been deposited, however, and average erosion rates could have been lower.

Maximum-known Gatuña thickness in the area around the WIPP is approximately 100 m 
(330 ft); at the WIPP site, the Gatuña is very thin to absent.  Ogallala deposits are known from 
the Divide east of the WIPP site, as well as from the High Plains further east and north.  On the 
High Plains northeast of the WIPP, the upper Ogallala surface slopes to the southeast at a rate of 
approximately 4 m/km (20 feet per mile).  A straight projection of the 1,250-m (4,100-ft) contour 
line from this High Plains surface intersects the site area, which is at an elevation slightly above 
1,036 m (3,400 ft).  This difference in elevation of 213 m (700 ft) represents one estimate, 
probably near an upper bound, of possible unloading subsequent to deposition of the Ogallala 
Formation.  
22 
23 
24 
Alternatively, the loading and unloading of the Ogallala could have been closer to 100 m 
(330 ft).  In any case, it would have occurred as a short-lived pulse over a few million years at 
most. 
25 
26 
27 
28 
29 
30 
31 
While the above inferences about greater unit thicknesses and probable occurrence are 
permissible, a realistic assessment suggests a more modest loading and unloading history 
(Powers and Holt 1995).  It is likely that the Dewey Lake accumulated to near local maximum 
thickness of approximately 240 m (787 ft) before being slightly eroded prior to the deposition of 
Triassic rocks.  It also is most probable that the Triassic rocks accumulated at the site to near 
local maximum thickness.  In two similar cycles of rapid loading, the Culebra was buried to a 
depth of approximately 650 m (2,132 ft) by the end of the Triassic.

It also seems unlikely that a significant thickness of Cretaceous rock accumulated at the WIPP 
site.  Erosion probably began during the Jurassic, slowed or stopped during the Early Cretaceous 
as the area was nearer or at base level, and then accelerated during the Cenozoic, especially in 
response to uplift as Basin and Range tectonics encroached on the area and the basin was tilted 
more.  Erosional beveling of Dewey Lake and Santa Rosa suggest considerable erosion since 
tilting in the mid-Cenozoic.  Erosion rates for this shorter period could have been relatively high, 
resulting in the greatest stress relief on the Culebra and surrounding units.  Some filling occurred 
during the Late Cenozoic as the uplifted areas to the west formed an apron of Ogallala sediment 
across much of the area, but it is not clear how much Gatuña or Ogallala sediment was deposited 
in the site area.  From general reconstruction of Gatuña history in the area (Powers and Holt 
1993, p. 281), the DOE infers that Gatuña or Ogallala deposits likely were not much thicker at

the WIPP site than they are now.  The loading and unloading spike (Figure 2-25) representing 
Ogallala thickness probably did not occur.  Cutting and headward erosion by the Pecos River has 
created local relief and unloading by erosion.

10 
At the WIPP site, this history is a little complicated by dissolution, though locally (for example, 
Nash Draw) the effects of erosion and dissolution are more significant.  The underlying 
evaporites have responded to foundering of anhydrite in less dense halite beds.  These have 
caused local uplift of the Culebra (as at ERDA 6) but little change in the overburden at the 
WIPP.  Areas east of the WIPP site are likely to have histories similar to that of the site.  West of 
the site, the final unloading is more complicated by dissolution and additional erosion leading to 
exposure of the Culebra along stretches of the Pecos River Valley.

Fault zones are well known along the Central Basin Platform, east of WIPP, from extensive 
drilling for oil and gas, as reported by Hills (1984).  Holt and Powers performed an analysis in 
1988 (CCA Appendix FAC, p. 4-14) of geophysical logs from oil and gas wells to examine the 
regional geology for the Rustler.  This analysis showed that faults along the margin of the 
Central Basin Platform displaced Rustler rocks of at least Late Permian age.  The overlying 
Dewey Lake shows marked thinning along the same trend, according to Schiel (1988, Figure 21), 
but the structure contours of the top of the Dewey Lake are not clearly offset.  Schiel (1988) 
concluded that the fault was probably reactivated during the Dewey Lake’s deposition, but 
movement ceased at least by the time the Santa Rosa was deposited.  No surface displacement or 
fault has been reported along this trend. 
22 
23 
24 
25 
26 
27 
Muehlberger et al. (1978) mapped Quaternary fault scarps along the Salt Basin graben west of 
both the Guadalupe and Delaware mountains.  These are the nearest known Quaternary faults of 
tectonic origin to the WIPP.  Kelley (1971) inferred the Carlsbad and Barrera faults along the 
eastern escarpment of the Guadalupe Mountains based mainly on vegetative lineaments.  Hayes 
and Bachman (1979) reexamined the field evidence for these faults in 1979 and concluded that 
they were nonexistent.  Figure 2-26 illustrates major regional structures, including faults. 
28 
29 
30 
31 
On a national basis, Howard et al. (1971, sheets 1 and 2) assessed the location and potential for 
activity of young faults.  For the region around the WIPP site, Howard et al. (1971, sheet 1) 
located faults along the western escarpment of the Delaware and Guadalupe mountain trend.  
These faults were judged to be Late Quaternary (approximately the last 500,000 years) or older. 
32 
33 
34 
35 
36 
In summary, there are no known Quaternary or Holocene faults of tectonic origin that offset 
rocks at the surface nearer to the site than the western escarpment of the Guadalupe Mountains.  
A significant part of the tilt of basin rocks is attributed to a mid-Miocene to Pliocene uplift trend 
along the Guadalupe-Sacramento Mountains that is inferred on the basis of High Plains 
sediments of the Ogallala.

2.1.5.4 Igneous Activity

work, indicating an age of 34.8 ± 0.8 million years.2  Work by Brookins (1980) on polyhalite 
samples in contact with the dike indicated an age of about 21.4 million years.  Volcanic ashes 
found in the Gatuña (Section 2.1.3.8) were airborne from distant sources and do not represent 
volcanic activity at the WIPP site.

Nontectonic processes and features, which include evaporite deformation and dissolution of 
strata, are known to be active in the Delaware Basin.  These processes are of interest because 
they represent mechanisms that are potentially disruptive to the repository in the long term.  Both 
processes have been investigated extensively.  The conclusions from these investigations are 
summarized in this section.

Halite in evaporite sequences is relatively plastic, which can lead to the process of deformation; 
it is also highly soluble, which can lead to the process of dissolution.  Both processes 
(deformation and dissolution) can produce structural features similar to those produced by 
tectonic processes.  The features developed by dissolution and deformation can be distinguished 
from similar-looking tectonic features where the underlying units do not reflect the same feature 
as do the evaporites.  As an example, the evaporite deformation commonly does not affect the 
underlying Bell Canyon.  Beds underlying areas of dissolved salt are not affected, but overlying 
units to the surface may be affected.  The deformation in the Castile and Salado also tends to die 
out in overlying units, and the Rustler or the Dewey Lake may show little, if any, effects from 
deformed evaporites.

The Castile has been known for many years to be deformed in parts of the Delaware Basin, 
especially along the northern margin.  Jones et al. (1973) clearly showed the Castile to be thicker 
from the northwestern to northern part of the basin margin, just inside the Capitan Reef.  A 
dissertation by Snider (1966, Figures 11 and 14) and a paper by Anderson et al. (1972, Figure 
10) also presented maps showing some evidence of thicker sections of Castile next to the  
                                                
 
2 Calzia and Hiss (1978, p. 44) reported 32.2 to 33.9 million years.  However, Powers et al. 1978 (CCA Appendix 
GCR, p. 3-80) reported a recalculated value of 34.8 ± 0.8 million years based on a change in measured decay 
constant.

Capitan. ERDA-6 was drilled during 1975 as part of the program to characterize an initial site for 
WIPP.  The borehole penetrated increasingly deformed beds through the Salado into the Castile, 
and, at 826 m (2,711 ft) depth, the borehole began to produce pressurized brine and gas.  
Anderson and Powers (1978, p. 79) and Jones (1981a) interpreted beds to have been displaced 
structurally by as much as 289.5 m (950 ft).  Some of the lower beds may have pierced overlying 
beds.  The beds were considered too structurally deformed to mine reasonably along single 
horizons for a repository.  Therefore, the site was abandoned in 1975, and the current site was 
located in 1976 (CCA Appendix GCR).  The deformed beds around ERDA-6 were considered 
part of a deformed zone within about 10 km (6 mi) of the inner margin of the Capitan Reef.  As a 
consequence, the preliminary selection criteria were revised to prohibit locating a new site within 
10 km (6 mi) of the Capitan margin.

General criteria for the present site for the WIPP appeared to be met based on initial data from 
drilling (ERDA-9) and geophysical surveys.  Beginning in 1977, the new site was more 
intensively characterized through geophysical surveys, including seismic reflection and drilling.  
Extensive seismic reflection work revealed good reflector quality in the southern part of the site 
and poor-quality or disturbed reflectors in a sector of the northern part of the site (see CCA 
Appendix DEF, Figure DEF-2.2).  The area of disturbed reflectors became known as the 
disturbed zone, the area of anomalous seismic reflectors, or the zone of anomalous seismic 
reflection data.  (The disturbed zone based on poor Castile seismic reflectors is completely 
different from the DRZ that describes the deformation around mined underground openings at 
the WIPP.)

Powers et al., in CCA Appendix GCR, Figures 4.4, 4.5, and 4.6, generally shows the disturbed 
zone beginning about 1.6 km (1 mi) north of the WIPP site center.  Borns et al. (1983), included 
two areas south of the WIPP site as showing the same features of the disturbed zone.  Neill et 
al.(1983) summarized the limits of the disturbed zone based on differing interpretations and 
included the area less than 1.6 km (1 mi) north of the site center, where the dip in the Castile 
begins to steepen.  WIPP-11 was drilled in early 1978 about 5 km (3 mi) north of the site center 
over part of the disturbed zone where proprietary petroleum company data had also indicated 
significant seismic anomalies.  The borehole encountered highly deformed beds within the 
Castile and altered thicknesses of halite units, but no pressurized brine and gas were found.

Less than 1.6 km (1 mi) north of the site center, seismic data indicated possible faulting of the 
upper Salado and the lower Rustler over the area of steepening Castile dips.  Four boreholes 
(WIPP-18, -19, -21, -22) were drilled into the upper Salado and demonstrated neither faulting 
nor significant deformation of the Rustler-Salado contact.  Lateral changes in the seismic 
velocity of the upper sections contributed to the interpretation of a possible fault and thus 
complicated interpretations of deeper structure.

WIPP-12 was located about 1.6 km (1 mi) north of the center of the site and drilled during 1978 
to a depth of 850 m (2,785 ft) in the upper Castile to determine the significance of structure on 
possible repository horizons.  The top of the Castile was encountered at an elevation about 49 m 
(160 ft) above the same contact in ERDA-9 at the site center. 
41 
42 
WIPP-12 was deepened during late 1981 to a depth of 1,200 m (3,925 ft) to test for possible 
brine and gas in the deformed Castile.  The probability of encountering brine and gas was

considered low because ERDA-6 and other known brine reservoirs in the Castile occurred in 
areas with greater deformation.  During drilling, fractured anhydrite in the upper Castile (lower 
A3) began to yield pressurized brine and gas.  The borehole was deepened to the basal anhydrite 
(A1) of the Castile.  Subsequent reservoir testing (Popielak et al. 1983) was conducted to 
estimate reservoir properties (see Section 2.2.1.2.2 and Section 6.4.8).

As a consequence of discovering pressurized brine and gas in WIPP-12, the EEG recommended 
that the design of the facility be changed and that proposed waste disposal areas in the north be 
moved or reoriented to the south.  After additional drilling of DOE-1, the DOE concluded that 
the design change had advantages, and the disposal facilities were placed south of the site center.

A microgravity survey of the site was designed to delineate further the structure within the 
disturbed zone, based on the large density differences between halite and anhydrite.  The gravity 
survey was unsuccessful in yielding any improved resolution of the Castile structure.

DOE-2 was the last WIPP borehole to examine structure within the Castile.  Potash drillhole data 
suggested a low point in Salado units about 3.3 km (2 mi) north of the site center.  It was 
proposed by Davies (1984, p. 175) that the Salado low might indicate deeper dissolution of 
Castile halite, somewhat similar to the dissolution causing breccia pipes (see Section 2.1.6.2 on 
evaporite dissolution).  The borehole demonstrated considerable Castile deformation, but there 
was no indication that halite had been removed by dissolution (Mercer et al. 1987; Borns 1987).

Nearby surface drilling, shafts, and underground drilling during early excavations at WIPP 
showed that the repository horizon varies modestly from the regional structure over the central 
part of the site; north of the site center, the beds dip gently to the south.  Borns (1987) suggested 
that the south dip is probably related to the dip on the underlying Castile.

The upper surface of MB 139, under the repository horizon, exhibited local relief in the 
exploratory salt-handling shaft.  Jarolimek et al. (1983, pp. 4 - 6) interpreted the relief as mainly 
caused by syndepositional growth of gypsum at the water-sediment interface to form mounds 
and by subsequent partial crushing.  Jarolimek et al. (1983) concluded that the MB relief was not 
caused by deformation because the base of the MB showed no comparable relief.  Based on 
concerns of the EEG, MB 139 was reevaluated.  Borns (1985) found less relief on the upper 
surface of the MB in the areas they examined; he also concluded that depositional processes 
were responsible for the relief.  In both cases, deformation is not thought to have caused the 
relief on MB 139.

For the investigation of geologic factors related to hydraulic properties of the Culebra, Powers 
(2002a; 2002b; 2003a) constructed elevation maps of the top of the Culebra for the region 
around the WIPP site.  A simplified version (Figure 2-28) showing the elevations of the top of 
the Culebra in meters above mean sea level (m amsl) illustrates that deformation of the Castile 
propagated upward through the Culebra to the northeast of the WIPP site, forming a northwest-
southeast trending anticline informally termed “the Divide anticline.”  Across the

In analyzing Castile structure in the northern Delaware Basin, Borns et al. (1983, p. 3) proposed 
five processes as the principal hypotheses to explain the structure:  gravity foundering, 
dissolution, gravity sliding, gypsum dehydration, and depositional processes.  Gravity foundering 
is the most comprehensive and best-accepted hypothesis of the five.  It is based on the fact that 
anhydrite is much more dense (about 2.9 g/cm3) than halite (about 2.1 g/cm3), and anhydrite beds 
therefore have a potential for sinking into underlying halite.  Regardless of which mechanism 
caused the disturbed zone, the important consideration is the long-term future effects.  To 
evaluate this, Borns et al. (1983) postulated that both gravity-driven deformation mechanisms 
could be ongoing.  The strain rates from such deformation are such that deformation would 
progress over the next 250,000 years and that such deformation would not directly jeopardize the 
disposal system.

Jones (1981a, p. 18) estimated that deformation of the Castile and overlying rocks took place 
before the Ogallala Formation was deposited, as he believes the unit is undeformed.  Anderson 
and Powers (1978, p. 79) inferred that data from ERDA-6 indicate that the Castile was deformed 
after the basin was tilted.  Though these lines of evidence could be consistent with mid-Miocene 
deformation, there are other interpretations consistent with older deformation.  There is no 
known evidence of surface deformation or other features to indicate recent deformation.

Because evaporites are much more soluble than most other rocks, project investigators have 
considered it important to understand the dissolution processes and rates that occur within the 
site being considered for long-term isolation.  These dissolution processes and rates constitute 
the limiting factor in any evaluation of the site.  Over the course of the WIPP project, extensive 
resources have been committed to identify and study a variety of features in southeastern New 
Mexico interpreted to have been caused by dissolution.  The subsurface distribution of halite for 
various units has been mapped.  Several different kinds of surface features have been attributed 
to dissolution of salt or karst formation.  The processes proposed or identified include point-
source (brecciation), deep dissolution, shallow dissolution, and karst.  These are each discussed 
in more detail in CCA Appendix DEF, Section DEF.3.  Screening arguments relative to 
dissolution are presented in Appendix PA, Attachment SCR, FEPs N17 and N21 (including 
dissolution associated with abandoned boreholes in the discussion for FEP H34).  These 
arguments are based principally on the observed rates and processes in the region.  These are 
described below.

Well before the WIPP project, several geologists recognized that dissolution is an important 
process in southeastern New Mexico, and that it contributed to the subsurface distribution of 
halite and to the surficial features.  Early studies include those by Lee (1925), Maley and

Huffington (1953), and Olive (1957) Robinson and Lang (1938, p. 100) identified an area under 
Nash Draw where brine occurred at about the stratigraphic position of the upper Salado-basal 
Rustler and considered that salt had been dissolved to produce a dissolution residue. Vine (1963, 
p. B38 and B40) mapped Nash Draw and surrounding areas.  Vine (1963) reported surficial 
domal structures, later called breccia pipes and identified as deep-seated dissolution and collapse 
features.

As the USGS and Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) began to survey southeastern New 
Mexico as an area in which to locate a repository site in salt, Brokaw et al. (1972) prepared a 
summary of the geology that included solution and subsidence as significant processes in 
creating the features of southeastern New Mexico.  Brokaw et al. (1972) also recognized a 
solution residue at the top of the salt in the Salado in the Nash Draw area, and the unit commonly 
became known as the brine aquifer because it yielded brine.  Brokaw et al. (1972) also 
interpreted the east-west decrease in thickness of the Rustler to be a consequence of removal by 
dissolution of halite and other soluble minerals.

During the early 1970s, the basic ideas about shallow dissolution of salt (generally from higher 
stratigraphic units and within a few hundred feet of the surface) were set out in a series of 
reports, as discussed in the following sections.  Piper (1973; 1974) independently evaluated the 
geological survey data for ORNL.  Claiborne and Gera (1974) concluded that salt was being 
dissolved too slowly from the near-surface units to affect a repository for several million years, 
at least.

By 1978, shallower drilling around the WIPP site to evaluate potash resources was interpreted by 
Jones (1978, p. 9), who felt that the Rustler included “dissolution debris, convergence of beds, 
and structural evidence for subsidence.”  Halite in the Rustler has been reevaluated by the DOE, 
but there are only minor differences in inferred distributions among the various investigators.  
These investigators do have different explanations about how this distribution occurred (see 
Section 2.1.3.5 on Rustler stratigraphy):  (1) through extensive dissolution of the Rustler’s halite 
after the Rustler was deposited, or (2) through syndepositional dissolution of halite from saline 
mud flat environments during Rustler deposition.

Anderson (1978) and Anderson et al. (1978) reevaluated halite distribution in deeper units, 
especially the Castile and Salado formations.  They identified local anomalies proposed as 
features developed after deep dissolution of halite by water flowing upward from the underlying 
Bell Canyon.  Anderson (1978) mapped geophysical log signatures of the Castile and interpreted 
lateral thinning and change from halite to non-halite lithology as evidence of lateral dissolution 
of deeper units (part of deep dissolution), and proposed that deep dissolution might threaten the 
WIPP site.  In response to Anderson’s (1978) developing concepts, ERDA-10 was drilled south 
of the WIPP area during the latter part of 1977.  ERDA-10 intercepted a stratigraphic sequence 
without evidence of solution residues in the upper Castile.

A set of annular or ring fractures is evident in the surface around San Simon Sink, about 30 km 
(18 mi) east of the WIPP site.  Nicholson and Clebsch (1961, p. 14) suggested that San Simon 
Sink developed as a result of deep-seated collapse.  WIPP-15 was drilled at about the center of 
the sink to a depth of 245 m (811 ft) to obtain samples for paleoclimatic data and stratigraphic 
data to interpret collapse.  Anderson (1978) and Bachman (1980) both interpret San Simon Sink

as dissolution and collapse features, and the annular fractures are not considered evidence of 
tectonic activity.

Following the work by Anderson, Bachman (1980, 1981) mapped surficial features in the Pecos 
Valley, especially at Nash Draw, and differentiated between those surface features in the basin 
that were formed by karst and those that were formed by deep collapse features over the Capitan.  
WIPP-32, WIPP-33, and two boreholes over the Capitan Reef were eventually drilled.  Their 
data, which demonstrated the concepts proposed by Bachman (1980, 1981), are documented in 
Snyder et al. (1982, p. 65).

A final program concerning dissolution and karst was initiated following a microgravity survey 
of a portion of the site during 1980.  Based on localized low-gravity anomalies, Barrows et al. 
(1983) interpreted several areas within the site as locations of karst.  WIPP-14 was drilled during 
1981 at a low-gravity anomaly.  It revealed normal stratigraphy through the zones proposed to be 
affected by karst.  As a follow-up, Bachman (1985) also reexamined surface features around the 
WIPP and concluded that there was no evidence for active karst within the WIPP site.  The 
nearest karst feature is northwest of the site boundaries at WIPP-33.

2.1.6.2.2  Extent of Dissolution

Within the Rustler, dissolution of halite is believed to have occurred only near the depositional 
margins, as discussed in Section 2.1.3.5.  Figure 2-15 shows the only two areas where evidence 
has been found for halite dissolution from the M3/H3 horizon in the Tamarisk.

Upper intervals of the Salado thin dramatically west and south of the WIPP site (Figure 2-29) 
compared to deeper Salado intervals.  There are no cores for further consideration of possible 
depositional variations.  As a consequence, this zone of thinning is interpreted by the DOE as the 
edge of dissolution of the upper Salado.

The dissolution of Ochoan evaporites through the near-surface processes of weathering and 
groundwater recharge has been studied extensively (Anderson 1981; Lambert 1983a; Lambert 
1983b; Bachman 1984; and CCA Appendix FAC).  The work of Lambert (1983a) was 
specifically mandated by the agreement between the DOE and the state of New Mexico to 
evaluate in detail the conceptual models of evaporite dissolution proposed by Anderson (1981).  
There was no clear consensus among investigators on the volume of rock salt removed.  Hence,

estimates of the instantaneous rate of dissolution vary significantly.  Dissolution may have taken 
place as early as the Ochoan, during or shortly after deposition.  For the Delaware Basin as a 
whole, Anderson (1981) proposed that up to 40 percent of the rock salt in the Castile and Salado 
formations was dissolved during the past 600,000 years.  Lambert (1983b, p. 292) suggested that 
in many places the variations in salt-bed thicknesses inferred from borehole geophysical logs that 
were the basis for Anderson’s (1981) calculation were depositional in origin, compensated by 
thickening of adjacent nonhalite beds, and were not associated with the characteristic dissolution 
residues.  Borns and Shaffer (1985, p. 44 – 45) also suggested in 1985 a depositional origin for 
many apparent structural features attributed to dissolution.

Snyder (1985, p. 8), as well as earlier workers (for example, Vine 1963; Lambert 1983b; and 
Bachman 1984), attribute the variations in thickness in the Rustler, which crops out in Nash 
Draw, to postdepositional evaporite dissolution.  Holt and Powers (CCA Appendix FAC, p. 9-2) 
have challenged this view and attribute the east-to-west thinning of salt beds in the Rustler to 
depositional facies variability rather than postdepositional dissolution.  Bachman (1974, 1976, 
1980) envisioned several episodes of dissolution since the Triassic, each dominated by greater 
degrees of evaporite exhumation and a wetter climate, interspersed with episodes of evaporite 
burial and/or a drier climate.  Evidence for dissolution after deposition of the Salado and before 
deposition of the Rustler along the western part of the Basin was cited by Adams (1944, p. 
1612).  Others have argued that the evaporites in the Delaware Basin were above sea level and 
therefore potentially subject to dissolution, during the Triassic, Jurassic, Tertiary, and Quaternary 
periods.  Because of discontinuous deposition, not all of these times are separable in the 
geological record of southeastern New Mexico.  Bachman (1980) contends that dissolution was 
episodic during the past 225 million years as a function of regional base level, climate, and 
overburden.

There have been several attempts to estimate the rates of shallow dissolution in the basin.  
Bachman (1974) provided initial estimates of dissolution rates based on a reconstruction of Nash 
Draw relationships, including the observation that portions of the Gatuña were deposited over 
areas of active dissolution and subsidence of the underlying evaporites.  Though these rates 
indicate no hazard to the WIPP related to Nash Draw dissolution, Bachman (1980, p. 85) later 
reconsidered the Nash Draw relationships and concluded that pre-Cenozoic dissolution had also 
contributed to salt removal.  Thus, the initial estimated rates were too high.

With regard to deep dissolution, Anderson concluded in 1978 that the integrity of the WIPP to 
isolate radioactive waste would not be jeopardized by dissolution within about one million years.  
Anderson and Kirkland (1980, pp. 66 - 69) expanded on the concept of brine density flow 
proposed by Anderson (1978) as a means of dissolving evaporites at a point by circulating water 
from the underlying Bell Canyon.  Wood et al. (1982, p. 100) examined the mechanism and 
concluded that, while it was physically feasible, it would not be effective enough in removing 
salt to threaten the ability of the WIPP to isolate transuranic (TRU) waste.

Bachman (1980, p. 97) separated breccia pipes, formed over the Capitan Reef by dissolution and 
collapse of a cylindrical mass of rock, from evaporite karst features that appear similar to breccia 
pipes.  There are surficial karst features, including sinks and caves, in large areas of the basin.

Nash Draw is the result of combined dissolution and erosion.  Within the site boundaries, there

The subsurface structure of the Culebra is shown in Figure 2-28.  South of the WIPP site, an 
antiformal structure informally called the “Remuda Basin anticline” has been created by 
dissolution of salt from the underlying Salado to the southwest of the anticline.  Beds generally 
dip to the east, and salt removed to the west created the other limb of the structure.  Units below 
the evaporites apparently do not show the same structure.

The DOE has determined that the hydrological characteristics of the disposal system are 
important because contaminant transport via fluid flow has a potential to impact the performance 
of the disposal system.  In addition, the EPA has provided numerous criteria related to 
groundwater in 40 CFR § 194.14(a).  At the WIPP site, one of the DOE’s selection criteria was 
to choose a location that would minimize this impact.  This was accomplished when the DOE 
selected (1) a host formation that contains little groundwater and transmits it poorly, (2) a 
location where the effects of groundwater flow are minimal and predictable, (3) an area where 
groundwater use is low, (4) an area where there are no permanent surface waters, (5) an area 
where future groundwater use is unlikely, and (6) a repository host rock that will not likely be 
affected by anticipated possible long-term climate changes within 10,000 years.

The following discussion summarizes the characteristics of the groundwater and surface water at 
and around the WIPP site.  This summary is based on data collection programs that were 
initiated with the WIPP program and that continue to some extent today.  The purpose of these 
programs was to provide information sufficient for the development and use of predictive models 
of the groundwater movement at the WIPP site.

For a comprehensive understanding of the impact of groundwater and surface water on the 
disposal system, the following factors have been evaluated: 
26 
Groundwater 
27 
• Horizontal and vertical flow fluxes and velocities, 
28 
• Hydraulic interconnectivity between rock units, 
29 
• Hydraulic parameters (porosity, etc.),

• General groundwater use, and 
31 
• Chemistry (including, but not limited to, salinity, mineralization, age, Eh, and pH).

Surface Water

• Regional precipitation and evapotranspiration rates,

Changes to the hydrological system due to human activity are evaluated in Chapter 6.0.

The specifics of groundwater modeling are found in Section 6.4.6, Appendix PA, Attachment 
MASS, Section MASS.14.2. The hydrological system is divided into four segments for the 
discussion in this chapter.  These are:  (1) the rock units below the Salado, which may impact the 
disturbed (human intrusion) performance of the disposal system, (2) the Salado, which mostly 
addresses the undisturbed performance of the disposal system, (3) the rock units above the 
Salado, which essentially impact only the disturbed (human intrusion) performance of the 
disposal system, and (4) the surface waters.  The groundwater regime is discussed in 
Section 2.2.1, and the surface-water regime in Section 2.2.2.

The WIPP site lies within the Pecos River drainage area (Figure 2-23, see also Section 2.2.2, 
Figure 2-43).  As discussed in the Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) (DOE 1980, 
Section 7.1.1), the climate is semiarid, with a mean annual precipitation of about 0.33 m (13 in.), 
a mean annual runoff of 2.5 to 5 mm (0.1 to 0.2 in.), and a mean annual pan evaporation of more 
than 2.5 m (100 in.).  Runoff is practically nonexistent and the WIPP does not have a well 
defined drainage pattern.  The general movement of runoff can be inferred from the topography 
in Figure 2-23.  Only one stream flow gaging station has been operated in the vicinity.  This is at 
the location shown as Hill Tank in Figure 2-23.  Observations at Hill Tank are discussed in 
Section 2.2.2.

Additional information about climatic conditions at the WIPP is given in Section 2.5.2.  Brackish 
water with total dissolved solids (TDS) concentrations of more than 3,000 parts per million is 
common in the shallow wells near the WIPP site.  Surface waters typically have high TDS 
concentrations, particularly of chloride, sulfate, sodium, magnesium, and calcium.  Additional 
information about water quality is given in Section 2.4.2.

At the WIPP site, the DOE has obtained groundwater hydrologic data from conventional and 
special-purpose test configurations in multiple surface boreholes.  Geophysical logging of the 
boreholes has provided hydrologic information on the rock strata intercepted.  Pressure 
measurements, fluid samples, and ranges of rock permeability have been obtained for selected 
formations through the use of standard and modified drill-stem tests.  Slug injection or 
withdrawal tests and other flow-rate tests have provided data to aid in the estimation of 
transmissivity and storage. The hydraulic heads of groundwaters within many water-bearing 
zones in the region have been mapped from measured depths to water in the boreholes. Since the

CCA was submitted to the EPA in 1996, the DOE has implemented a number of monitoring 
programs (see Appendix MON-2004), including the Groundwater Monitoring Program, to meet 
the assurance requirements of 40 CFR § 191.14(b).  In addition to the groundwater monitoring 
program, other hydrologic data gathered since the CCA come from logging of new or 
replacement wells, piezometers, special-purpose field investigations, and surveys of drilling 
practices in the Delaware Basin.  A data summary of all these activities is provided in Appendix 
DATA.

Historically, the DOE has obtained hydrological data principally from a conventional well-
monitoring network (Figures 2-3 through 2-6 are maps of the well locations) comprising 71 wells 
located on 45 separate wellpads (DOE 2003).  Most of the 71 wells are completed only to a 
single hydrologic unit; however, six are multiple-completions to allow monitoring of two or 
more units in the same well.  Hydrologic information (such as hydraulic head) is obtained at 80 
completion intervals within the 71 wells.  The focus of the hydrological monitoring is the Rustler 
(comprising 72 of the 80 monitored intervals) because this formation contains two of the most 
transmissive saturated units, the Culebra and Magenta Dolomites, which are important to the 
modeling of releases during various human intrusion scenarios.  Limited hydrological monitoring 
of the Bell Canyon, Dewey Lake, and Santa Rosa also occurs.

Rock units that are shown in the conceptual models in Section 6.4 to be important to disposal 
system performance from a hydrological standpoint are the Castile, the Salado, the Rustler, and 
the Dewey Lake (Figures 2-30 and 2-31).  However, other units which are discussed due to their 
significance in screening hydrological processes or because they are less important to the 
conceptual model include the Bell Canyon, the Capitan, the Rustler-Salado contact zone, and the 
supra-Dewey Lake units.  These will also be discussed because they are features of the 
groundwater flow system of the WIPP region.

The Bell Canyon is of interest to the DOE because it is the first regionally continuous water-
bearing unit beneath the WIPP and is the target stratigraphic horizon for salt-water injection by 
industry outside of the WIPP site boundary. The halite and anhydrite layers of the Castile 
provide a hydrologic barrier between the Salado and the underlying Bell Canyon.  The Castile is 
of interest to PA because it contains isolated high-permeability zones containing pressurized 
brine.  As discussed in Section 2.1.6.1, several such zones of pressurized brine have been 
intercepted by boreholes near the WIPP site, and one or more of these zones may exist at the 
WIPP site. 
33 
34 
35 
The Salado comprises low-permeability beds of variable composition.  The low permeability of 
the Salado provides a hydrologic barrier in all directions between the repository and the 
accessible environment or more transmissive beds.  At the repository horizon, a much higher

The Rustler contains two laterally transmissive members.  The Culebra is the first laterally 
continuous unit located above the WIPP underground facility to display hydraulic conductivity 
sufficient to warrant investigation for lateral contaminant transport.  It is also the most 
transmissive continuously saturated unit above the WIPP repository.  Therefore, except for a 
release directly to the surface, the Culebra provides the most direct pathway between the WIPP 
underground and the accessible environment.  The hydrology and fluid geochemistry of the 
Culebra are complex and, as a result, have received a great deal of study (see, for example, 
LaVenue et al. 1988, 1990; Haug et al. 1987; and Siegel et al. 1991.  The Magenta, although 
more transmissive than the anhydrite and claystone members of the Rustler, has lower 
transmissivity than the Culebra, and is unfractured at the WIPP.

There was no inflow of water from the Dewey Lake into the WIPP shafts after they were 
completed and prior to their lining, indicating unsaturated conditions or low transmissivity. 
However, since 1995, routine inspections of the WIPP exhaust shaft have revealed water 
entering the shaft at a depth of approximately 24 m (80 ft) at a location where no water had been 
observed during construction (the DOE is investigating the source and extent of this water; see 
Sections 2.2.1.4.2.1 and Appendix DATA).  The quantity and quality of water in the Dewey 
Lake is also monitored in a deeper fractured zone in the Dewey Lake at well WQSP-6a (WIPP 
MOC 1995).

The Santa Rosa is shallow and unsaturated at the site (with the exception of a perched water 
table directly below the WIPP surface structures; see Section 2.2.1.4.2.2 and Appendix DATA),

In conclusion, at the WIPP site, the DOE recognizes the Salado as the most significant 
nontransmissive unit and the Culebra and the Magenta as the most significant transmissive units.  
Other units are considered to have less important roles.  The DOE’s sampling and analysis of 
non-Salado groundwater has focused on the Culebra and Magenta, and their hydrologic 
background, presented here, is more detailed than for other non-Salado rock units.  Table 2-4 
provides an overview of the hydrologic characteristics of the Rustler rock units at the WIPP site 
and the Rustler-Salado contact zone in Nash Draw.  In developing this position on modeling the 
hydrology of the WIPP, the DOE considered several modeling approaches.  These are 
summarized in CCA Appendix MASS, Section MASS.14.1 in general and Section MASS.15.1 
for the Culebra.  The DOE’s conceptual models for hydrology are in Sections 6.4.5 and 6.4.6.

The EPA sought information supporting the conceptualization of the disposal system and the 
major site-related characteristics included in the PA modeling during the compliance review 
process for Section 194.14(a)(3).  In general, the EPA concluded that the groundwater hydrology 
information for the various geologic and hydrostratigraphic units at the WIPP site identified the 
important characteristics of the PA and was therefore technically sufficient.  The EPA also noted 
that the primary hydrogeologic units of concern relative to containment capability of the WIPP 
are the Castile, Salado, Rustler, and the Dewey Lake.

The EPA noted that the potential for fluid migration through Salado marker beds and the Culebra 
were acknowledged by DOE and included in the PA calculations.  While the Dewey Lake is a 
potential underground source of drinking water (Section 8.2.2), DOE’s modeling indicated that 
radionuclides will not reach the Dewey Lake, thus removing the formation as a unit needing 
consideration as a pathway (Docket A-93-02, Item II-G-26 and Docket A-93-02, Item II-G-28).  
The EPA concluded that Salado marker beds, and the Culebra were adequately identified and 
characterized to the level necessary for PA calculations.

The DOE addresses issues related to groundwater flow and radionuclide transport within the 
context of a conceptual model of how the natural hydrologic system works on a large scale.  The 
conceptual model of regional flow around the WIPP that is presented here is based on widely 
accepted concepts of regional groundwater flow in groundwater basins (see, for example, 
Hubbert 1940; Tóth 1963; and Freeze and Witherspoon 1967).

See CCA Appendix MASS, Sections MASS.14.1 and MASS.14.2 for a summary of the DOE’s 
activities leading to the acceptance of the groundwater basin model as a reasonable 
representation of groundwater flow in the region.

An idealized groundwater basin is a three-dimensional closed hydrologic unit bounded on the 
bottom by an impermeable rock unit (units with much smaller permeability than the units above), 
on the top by the ground surface, and on the sides by groundwater divides.  The water table is the 
upper boundary of the region of saturated liquid flow.  All rocks in the basin are expected to 
have finite permeability; in other words, hydraulic continuity exists throughout the basin. This 
means that the potential for liquid flow from any unit to any other units exists, although the 
existence of any particular flow path is dependent on a number of conditions related to gradients 
and permeabilities.  All recharge to the basin is by infiltration of precipitation to the water table 
and all discharge from the basin is by flow across the water table to the land surface.

Differences in elevation of the water table across an idealized basin provide the driving force for 
groundwater flow.  The pattern of groundwater flow depends on the lateral extent of the basin, 
the shape of the water table, and the heterogeneity of the permeability of the rocks in the basin.  
Water flows along gradients of hydraulic head from regions of high head to regions of low head.  
The highest and lowest heads in the basin occur at the water table at its highest and lowest 
points, respectively.  Therefore, groundwater flows from the elevated regions of the water table, 
downward across confining layers (layers with relatively small permeability), then laterally along 
more conductive layers, and finally upward to exit the basin in regions where the water table 
(and by association, the land surface) is at low elevations.  Recharge is necessary to maintain 
relief on the water table, without which flow does not occur. 
29 
30 
31 
32 
33 
34 
Groundwater divides are boundaries across which it is assumed that no groundwater flow occurs.  
In general, these are located in areas where groundwater flow is dominantly downward (recharge 
areas) or where groundwater flow is upward (discharge areas).  Topography and surface-water 
drainage patterns provide clues to the location of groundwater divides.  Ridges between creeks 
and valleys may serve as recharge-type divides, and rivers, lakes, or topographic depressions 
may serve as discharge-type divides.

In the groundwater basin model, rocks can be classified into hydrostratigraphic units.  A 
hydrostratigraphic unit is a continuous region of rock across which hydraulic properties are 
similar or vary within described or stated limits.  The definition of hydrostratigraphic units is a 
practical exercise to separate rock regions with similar hydrologic characteristics from rock 
regions with dissimilar hydrologic characteristics.  Although hydrostratigraphic units often are 
defined to be similar to stratigraphic units, this need not be the case.  Hydrostratigraphic unit 
boundaries can reflect changes in hydraulic properties related to differences in composition,

Confining layers in a groundwater basin model can be characterized as allowing vertical flow 
only.  The amount of vertical flow occurring in a confining layer generally decreases in relation 
to the depth of the layer.  Flow in conductive units is more complicated.  In general, flow will be 
lateral through conductive units.  The magnitude (in other words, volume flux) of lateral flow is 
related to the thickness, conductivity, and gradient present in the unit.  Gradients generally 
decrease in deeper units.  The direction of flow is generally related to the distance the unit is 
from the land surface.  Near the land surface, flow directions are influenced primarily by the 
local slope of the land surface.  In deeper conductive units, flow directions are generally oriented 
parallel to the direction between the highest and lowest points in a groundwater basin.  Thus, 
flow rates, volumes, and directions in conductive units in a groundwater basin are generally not 
expected to be the same.

In the WIPP region, the Salado provides an extremely low-permeability layer that forms the base 
for a regional groundwater-flow basin in the overlying rocks of the Rustler, Dewey Lake, and 
Santa Rosa.  The Castile and Salado together form their own groundwater system, and they 
separate flow in units above them from that in units below.  Because of the plastic nature of 
halite and the resulting low permeability, fluid pressures in the evaporites are more related to 
lithostatic stress than to the shape of the water table in the overlying units, and regionally neither 
vertical nor horizontal flow will occur as a result of natural pressure gradients in time scales 
relevant to the disposal system.  (On a repository scale, however, the excavations themselves 
create pressure gradients that may induce flow near the excavated region.)  Consistent with the 
recognition of the Salado as the base of the groundwater basin of primary interest, the following 
discussion is divided into three sections:  hydrology of units below the Salado, hydrology of the 
Salado, and hydrology of the units above the Salado.  The DOE has implemented the 
groundwater basin model in the conceptual model for groundwater flow within the rocks above 
the Salado.  The details of the model are discussed in Section 6.4.6.  Key modeling assumptions 
associated with the implementation are provided in Appendix PA, Attachment MASS, Section

December 19, 1996 (Docket A-93-02, Item II-I-01).  The DOE provided additional information 
regarding these issues in letters dated January 24, 1997; February 7, 1997; April 15, 1997; June 
13, 1997; June 27, 1997; and July 3, 1997 (Docket A-93-02, Items II-I-03, II-I-07, II-I-24, II-H-

DOE provide general hydraulic characteristic information for all geologic units within the 
disposal system by revising a partially complete table included in the letter.  The DOE letter, 
dated February 14, 1997 (Docket A-93-02, Item II-I-08), transmitted the summary table 
providing the EPA with additional groundwater hydrology information related to hydraulic 
conductivity, storage coefficients, transmissivity, permeability, thickness, matrix and fracture 
characteristics, and hydraulic gradients for each of the geologic units in the WIPP disposal 
system.  This information was reproduced as Figure IV-10 in EPA Technical Support Document

groundwater flow: (1) the estimated infiltration at the surface and to the Dewey Lake, and (2) the 
estimated vertical flow of groundwater into other transmissive units within the area surrounding 
the WIPP.  The DOE provided the estimates in a letter dated February 26, 1997 (Docket A-93-

Units of interest to the WIPP project below the Salado are the Bell Canyon and the Castile.  
These units have quite different hydrologic characteristics.  Because of its potential to contain 
brine reservoirs below the repository, the hydrology of the Castile is regarded as having the most 
potential of all units below the Salado to impact the performance of the disposal system.

hydrostratigraphic unit about 300 m (1,000 ft) thick.  Tests at five boreholes (Atomic Energy 
Commission [AEC]-7, AEC-8, ERDA-10, DOE-2, and Cabin Baby [CB]-1) (CCA Appendix 
HYDRO, pp. 29-31; Beauheim et al. 1983, pp. 4-9 to 4-12; Beauheim 1986, p. 61-1]) indicate a 
range of hydraulic conductivities for the Bell Canyon from 1.7 × 10-7 to 3.5 × 10-12 m/s (5 × 
10-2 ft/day to 1 × 10-6 ft/day).  The pressure measured in the Bell Canyon at the DOE-2 and 
CB-1 boreholes at the time of the CCA ranged from 12.6 to 13.3 megapascals.  Under the current 
groundwater-monitoring program, Bell Canyon water levels are measured in only two wells: CB-
1 and AEC-8 (see locations in Figure 2-6).

After recovery from well work in 1999, the Bell Canyon water levels at CB-1 have remained 
steady for more that three years at 919 m (3,015 ft) above mean sea level (SNL 2003a).  In 
contrast, since the beginning of 1994, the Bell Canyon water levels at AEC-8 have steadily risen 
by more than 32 m (106 ft) at a rate of approximately 0.5 m/month (1.6 ft/month) and stood at 
over 933.4 m (3,062 ft) above mean sea level (SNL 2003a) at the end of 2002.  This water-level 
rise is hypothesized to be the result of deterioration of the well and not a response to actual Bell 
Canyon hydrologic conditions at this location.  The well will be inspected and repaired or 
plugged and abandoned, as necessary, according to the requirements of DOE’s groundwater 
monitoring program (see Appendix MON-2004).

Fluid flow in the Bell Canyon is markedly influenced by the presence of the extremely low-
permeability Castile and Salado above it, which effectively isolate the Bell Canyon from 
interaction with overlying units except where the Castile is absent because of erosion or 
nondeposition, such as in the Guadalupe Mountains, or where the Capitan Reef is the overlying 
unit (Figures 2-30 and 2-31).  Because of the isolating nature of the Castile and Salado, fluid 
flow directions in the Bell Canyon are sensitive only to gradients established over very long 
distances.  At the WIPP, the brines in the Bell Canyon flow northeasterly under an estimated 
hydraulic gradient of 4.7 to 7.6 m/km (25 to 40 ft/mi) and discharge into the Capitan aquifer.

Velocities are on the order of tenths of feet per year, and groundwater yields from wells in the 
Bell Canyon are 2.3 to 5.8 liters (0.6 to 1.5 gallons) per minute.  The fact that flow directions in 
the Bell Canyon under the WIPP are inferred to be almost opposite to the flow directions in units 
above the Salado (see Section 2.2.1.4) is not of concern because, as discussed above, the 
presence of the Castile and Salado makes the flow in the Bell Canyon sensitive to gradients 
established over long distances, whereas flow in the units above the Salado is sensitive to 
gradients established by more local variations in water table elevation.

As discussed in Appendix DATA, oil companies are currently involved in deep-well injection at 
several locations outside of the WIPP site boundary.  Specifically, salt water (brine) produced 
during oil-field exploitation is injected into the Bell Canyon and Brushy Canyon Formations.  
For nearly four years, the DOE has monitored injection rates and pressures for a cluster of six of 
these salt water injection wells located approximately 1.6 to 2.4 km (1 to 1.5 mi) northeast of 
well H-9.  Table 2-5 summarizes the depth intervals of the injection zones for each well.  The 
cluster of six wells is currently injecting approximately 800 to 950 m3 per day (5,000 to 6,000 
barrels per day) of salt water; however, in previous years, injection has ranged from 
approximately 480 to 1270 m3 per day (3,000 to 8,000 barrels per day) (SNL 2003a).  Wellhead 
injection pressures typically range between 5.5 to 6.9 MPa (800 to 1,000 psi).  Because only two 
Bell Canyon wells are currently being monitored, the effect of salt-water injection on Bell 
Canyon water levels is speculative, but water levels in the Bell Canyon monitoring well nearest 
the cluster (i.e., CB-1, Figure 2-6) indicate no response to the injection.  Additional discussion on 
potential effects of salt-water injection on the WIPP hydrologic setting is provided below in 
Section 2.2.1.4.

As described in Section 2.1.3, the Castile is dominated by low-permeability anhydrite and halite 
zones.  However, fracturing in the upper anhydrite has generated isolated regions with much 
greater permeability than the surrounding intact anhydrite.  These regions are located in the area 
of structural deformation, as discussed in Section 2.1.6.1.1.  The higher-permeability regions of 
the Castile contain brine at pressures greater than hydrostatic and have been referred to as brine 
reservoirs (see Figure 2-32).  The fluid pressure measured by Popielak et al. (1983) in the WIPP-
12 borehole (12.7 megapascals) is greater than the nominal hydrostatic pressure for a column of 
equivalent brine at that depth (11.1 megapascals).   
32 
33 
Therefore, under open-hole conditions, brine could flow upward to the surface through a 
borehole.

37 
Results of hydraulic tests performed in the ERDA-6 and WIPP-12 boreholes suggest that the 
extent of the highly permeable portions of the Castile is limited.  As discussed in Section 2.1.3.3 
and modeled in Section 6.4.8, the vast majority of brine is thought to be stored in low-
permeability microfractures; about  five percent of the overall brine volume is stored in large

respectively.  The conceptual model of the Castile brine region is discussed in Section 6.4.8.  The 
model uses parameter values derived from the ERDA-6 and WIPP-12 tests for quantifying some 
reservoir characteristics.  The derivation of some model parameters in Appendix PA, Attachment

A geophysical survey using time-domain electromagnetic (TDEM) methods was completed over 
the WIPP-12 brine reservoir and the waste disposal panels (The Earth Technology Corporation 
1988).  The TDEM measurements detected a conductor interpreted to be the WIPP-12 brine 
reservoir and also indicated that similar brine occurrences may be present within the Castile 
under a portion of the waste disposal panels.  Powers et al. (1996) used 354 drill holes and 27 
Castile brine occurrences to establish that there is an eight percent probability of a hole drilled 
into the waste panel region encountering brine in the Castile.  This analysis was included as CCA

Initially, the EPA found that DOE’s discussion of the size, orientation, and repressurization 
potential of the Castile brine reservoirs was not well supported (Docket A-93-02, Item II-I-27).  
The EPA required the probability of encountering a brine reservoir to be sampled between a 
range of 1 and 60 percent in the PAVT (Docket A-93-02, Item II-G-26 and Docket A-93-02, 
Item II-G-28).  In addition, the EPA modified the values for parameters such as bulk 
compressibility of Castile rock so that the brine reservoir sampling used in the PA would better 
represent the larger, higher-end possible brine volumes.  Further information on the EPA review 
of these parameters may be found in CARD 23—Models and Computer Codes (EPA 1998f),

Based on these analyses, there was no significant impact on releases over the range of 
probabilities sampled.  However, the DOE identified this parameter as a compliance monitoring 
parameter (see Appendix DATA) and conducts annual surveys as part of the Delaware Basin 
Monitoring Program (see Appendix MON-2004) to identify Castile brine encounters by drillers 
in the basin.  Since the CCA, these surveys have identified five additional brine encounters.  
Appendix DATA provides extensive information pertinent to the brine reservoirs. The Delaware 
Basin Monitoring Annual Report (DOE 2002a), for example, documents three of the five Castile 
brine encounters.  Two were located near well ERDA-6 northeast of the WIPP site and one was 
located to the southwest of the site.  In the two encounters northeast of the site, reports indicated 
several hundred barrels of brine per hour were produced, but all brine was contained within the 
pits; thus, it was not necessary to file a report with the New Mexico Oil Conservation Division.  
In the other encounter, initial flows of from 64 to 79 m3 (400 to 500 barrels) per hour were 
observed, but flow dissipated within hours of the encounter.  Because of the relatively large 
number of boreholes (345 wells in the nine-township area drilled between 1996 and 2002), the 
five brine encounters that occurred do not substantially change the probability defined by Powers 
et al. (1996) and are unlikely to have any significant impact on PA given the large range of 
probabilities sampled in the PAVT analyses.

The origin of brine in the Castile has been investigated geochemically.  Popielak et al. (1983, p. 
2) concluded that the ratios of major and minor element concentrations in the brines indicate that 
these fluids originated from ancient seawater and that no evidence exists for fluid contribution 
from present meteoric waters.  The Castile brine chemistries from the ERDA-6 and WIPP-12 
reservoirs are distinctly different from each other and from local groundwaters.  These 
geochemical data indicate that brine in reservoirs has not mixed to any significant extent with 
other waters and has not circulated.  The brines are saturated, or nearly so, with respect to halite 
and, consequently, have little potential to dissolve halite.  The chemical composition of Castile 
brine is given in Table 2-6. It’s the use of the chemical composition of Castile brine as a 
parameter in the conceptual model of repository performance is discussed in Appendix PA.

2.2.1.3 Hydrology of the Salado

34 
As described in Section 2.1.3, the Salado consists mainly of halite and anhydrite.  A considerable 
amount of information about the hydraulic properties of these rocks has been collected through 
field and laboratory experiments.  Appendix PA summarizes this information. 
35

Hydraulic testing in the Salado in boreholes in the WIPP underground repository provided 
quantitative estimates of the hydraulic properties controlling brine flow through the Salado 
(Beauheim et al. 1991a; Beauheim et al. 1993; Domski et al. 1996; Roberts et al. 1999).  This 
work was summarized by Beauheim and Roberts (2002).  The stratigraphic intervals tested

include both pure and impure halite, as well as anhydrite.  Tests influence rock as far as 10 m (33 
ft) distant from the test zone and therefore provide results representative of rock beyond the zone 
of mechanical disturbance associated with drilling of the test boreholes.  Because tests close to 
the repository are within the DRZ that surrounds the excavated regions (see Section 3.2), results 
of the tests farthest from the repository are most representative of undisturbed conditions.

Fifty-nine intervals were isolated and monitored and/or tested in 27 boreholes.  Thirty-five of the 
intervals isolated halite beds, and 24 isolated anhydrite beds.  Permeability estimates were 
obtained from 14 of the halite intervals and 16 of the anhydrite intervals.  Interpreted

permeabilities using a Darcy-flow model vary from 2 ×10-23 to 3 ×10-16 m2 for impure halite 
intervals, with the lower values representing halite with few impurities and the higher values 
representing intervals within the DRZ of the excavations.  Interpreted formation pore pressures 
vary from atmospheric to 9.8 MPa for impure halite, with the lower pressures showing the 
effects of the DRZ.  Tests in pure halite show no observable response, indicating either

Interpreted permeabilities using a Darcy-flow model vary from 2 ×10-20 to 9 ×10-18 m2 for

anhydrite intervals (Beauheim and Roberts 2002 p. 82).  Lower values are caused by 
depressurization near the excavation.

As discussed in Beauheim and Roberts (2002), permeabilities of some tested intervals have been 
found to be dependent on the pressures at which the tests were conducted, which is interpreted as 
the result of fracture apertures changing in response to changes in effective stress.  Flow 
dimensions inferred from most test responses are subradial, meaning that flow to/from the test 
boreholes is not radially symmetric but is derived from a subset of the rock volume.  The 
subradial flow dimensions are believed to reflect channeling of flow through fracture networks, 
or portions of fractures, that occupy a diminishing proportion of the radially available space, or 
through percolation networks that are not “saturated” (that is, fully interconnected).  This is 
probably related to the directional nature of the permeability created or enhanced by excavation 
effects.  Other test responses indicate flow dimensions between radial and spherical, which may 
reflect propagation of pressure transients above or below the plane of the test interval or into 
regions of increased permeability (e.g., closer to an excavation).  The variable stress and pore-
pressure fields around the WIPP excavations probably contribute to the observed non-radial flow 
dimensions.

The properties of anhydrite interbeds have also been investigated in the laboratory.  Tests were 
performed on three groups of core samples from MB 139 as part of the Salado Two-Phase Flow 
Laboratory Program.  The laboratory experiments provided porosity, intrinsic permeability, and 
capillary pressure data.  Analysis of capillary pressure test results indicates a threshold pressure 
of less than 1 MPa.  Both laboratory and field data were used to establish hydraulic parameters 
for the Salado for PA as summarized in CCA Appendix PAR (Tables PAR-6 and PAR-7).

The EPA believed the DOE’s initial information on anhydrite characteristics and response to 
high pressure was unclear.  In response, the DOE provided the EPA with data on modeling 
implementation and anhydrite characterization clarifying DOE’s approach to anhydrite fracture 
properties under pressurized conditions.  The EPA concluded that while fracture distribution and 
subsequent fluid flow in the Salado marker beds cannot be detailed, the general application of 
fracturing and subsequent fluid flow appears to be an adequate representation of overall site 
conditions. The EPA also concluded that DOE’s modeling of fractures within Salado anhydrite 
marker beds is acceptable.  For further discussion on this topic, see CARD 23—Models and 
Computer Codes, Section 1.3.2.

Fluid pressure above hydrostatic is a hydrologic characteristic of the Salado (and the Castile) that 
plays a potentially important role in the repository behavior. It is difficult to measure natural

pressures in these formations accurately because the boreholes or repository excavations required 
to access the rocks decrease the stress in the region measured.  Stress released instantaneously 
decreases fluid pressure in the pores of the rock, so measured pressures must be considered as a 
lower bound of the natural pressures.  Stress effects related to test location and the difficulty of 
making long-duration tests in lower-permeability rocks result in higher pore pressures observed 
to date in anhydrites.  The highest observed pore pressures in halite-rich units, near Room Q, are 
on the order of 9 MPa, whereas the highest pore pressures observed in anhydrite are 
approximately 12 MPa (Beauheim and Roberts 2002, p. 82).  Far-field pore pressures in halite-
rich and anhydrite beds in the Salado at the repository level are expected to be similar because 
the anhydrites are too thin and of too low permeabilities to have liquid pressures much different 
than those of the surrounding salt.  For comparison, the hydrostatic pressure for a column of 
brine at the depth of the repository is about 7 MPa, and the lithostatic pressure calculated from 
density measurements in ERDA-9 is about 15 MPa.

Fluid pressures in sedimentary basins that are much higher or much lower than hydrostatic are 
referred to as abnormal pressures by the petroleum industry, where they have received 
considerable attention.  In the case of the Delaware Basin evaporites, the high pressures are 
almost certainly maintained because of the large compressibility and plastic nature of the halite 
and, to a lesser extent, the anhydrite.  The lithostatic pressure at a particular horizon must be 
supported by a combination of the stress felt by both the rock matrix and the pore fluid.  In 
highly deformable rocks, the portion of the stress that must be borne by the fluid exceeds 
hydrostatic pressure but cannot exceed lithostatic pressure.

Brine content within the Salado is estimated at 1 to 2 percent by weight, although the thin clay 
seams have been inferred by Deal et al. (1993, pp. 4-3) to contain up to 25 percent brine by 
volume.  Where sufficient permeability exists, this brine will move towards areas of lower 
hydraulic potential, such as a borehole or mined section of the Salado.

Observation of the response of pore fluids in the Salado to changes in pressure boundary 
conditions at walls in the repository, in boreholes without packers, in packer-sealed boreholes, or 
in laboratory experiments is complicated by low permeability and low porosity.  Qualitative data 
on brine flow to underground workings and exploratory boreholes were collected routinely 
between 1985 and 1993 under the Brine Sampling and Evaluation Program (BSEP) and have 
been documented in a series of reports (Deal and Case 1987; Deal et al. 1987, 1989, 1991a, 
1991b, 1993, and 1995).  A discussion of alternative conceptual models for Salado fluid flow is 
given in Appendix PA, Attachment MASS, Section MASS.7.  Additional data on brine inflow 
are available from the Large-Scale Brine Inflow Test (Room Q).  Flow has been observed to 
move to walls in the repository, to boreholes without packers, and to packer-sealed boreholes.  
These qualitative and relatively short-term observations suggest that brine flow in the fractured 
DRZ is a complex process.  In some locations, evidence for flow is no longer observed where it 
once was; in others, flow has begun where it once was not observed.  In many cases, 
observations and experiments must last for months or years to obtain useful results.

For PA modeling, brine flow is a calculated term dependent on local hydraulic gradients and 
properties of the Salado units.  Data on pore pressure and permeability of halite and anhydrite 
layers are available from the Room Q tests and other borehole tests as summarized in Beauheim

have been conducted.  Initial investigations were reported in Powers et al. (CCA Appendix GCR, 
Section 7.5) and were continued once access to the underground was established.  The most 
comprehensive data were developed by the BSEP (Deal and Case 1987; Deal et al. 1987, 1989, 
1991a, 1991b, 1993, 1995).  Results are summarized in Table 2-6.  CCA Appendix SOTERM 
discusses the role of brine chemistry in the conceptual model for actinide dissolution.  The 
conceptual model is described in Section 6.4.3.5.

In evaluating groundwater flow above the Salado, the DOE considers the Rustler, Dewey Lake, 
Santa Rosa, and overlying units to form a groundwater basin with boundaries coinciding with 
selected groundwater divides as discussed in Section 2.2.1.1.  The model boundary follows Nash 
Draw and the Pecos River valley to the west and south and the San Simon Swale to the east 
(Figure 2-33).  The boundary continues up drainages and dissects topographic highs along its 
northern part.  These boundaries represent groundwater divides whose positions remain fixed 
over the past several thousand years and 10,000 years into the future.  For reasons described in 
Section 2.2.1.2.1, the lower boundary of the groundwater basin is the upper surface of the 
Salado.  Nash Draw and the Pecos River are areas where discharge to the surface occurs.  Hunter 
(1985) described discharge at Surprise Spring and into saline lakes in Nash Draw.  She reported 
groundwater discharge into the Pecos River between Avalon Dam north of Carlsbad and a point 
south of Malaga Bend as approximately 0.92 m3/s (32.5 ft3/s), mostly in the region near Malaga 
Bend.

Within this groundwater basin, hydrostratigraphic units with relatively high permeability are 
called conductive units, and those with relatively low permeability are called confining layers.  
The confining layers consist of halite and anhydrite and are perhaps five orders of magnitude less 
permeable than conductive units.

In a groundwater basin, the position of the water table moves up and down in response to 
changes in recharge.  The amount of recharge is generally a very small fraction of the amount of 
rainfall; this condition is expected for the WIPP.  Modeling of recharge changes within the 
groundwater basin as a function of climate variation is discussed in Section 6.4.9.  The water 
table would stabilize at a particular position if the pattern of recharge remained constant for a 
long time.  The equilibrated position depends, in part, on the distribution of hydraulic 
conductivity in all hydrostratigraphic units in the groundwater basin.  However, the position of 
the water table depends mainly on the topography and geometry of the groundwater basin and 
the hydraulic conductivity of the uppermost strata.  The position of the water table can adjust 
slowly to changes in recharge.  Consequently, the water table can be at a position that is very 
much different from its equilibrium position at any given time.  Generally, the water table drops

The asymmetry of response occurs because the rate at which the water table drops is limited by 
the rate at which water flows through the entire basin.  In contrast, the rate at which the water 
table rises depends mainly on the recharge rate and the porosity of the uppermost strata.  From 
groundwater basin modeling, the head distribution in the groundwater basin appears to 
equilibrate rapidly with the position of the water table.

The groundwater basin conceptual model (Corbet and Knupp 1996) described above has been 
implemented in a numerical model, as described in CCA Appendix MASS, Section MASS.14.2.  
This model has been used to simulate the interactive nature of flow through conductive layers 
and confining units for a variety of possible rock properties and climate futures.  Thus, this 
model has allowed insight into the magnitude of flow through various units.  The DOE has used 
this insight as a basis for model simplifications used in PA that are described here and in Chapter 
6.

One conclusion from the regional groundwater basin modeling is pertinent here.  In general, 
vertical leakage through confining layers is directed downward over all of the controlled area.  
This downward leakage uniformly over the WIPP site is the result of a well-developed discharge 
area, Nash Draw and the Pecos River, along the western and southern boundaries of the 
groundwater basin.  This area acts as a drain for the laterally conductive units in the groundwater 
basin, causing most vertical leakage in the groundwater basin to occur in a downward direction.  
This conclusion is important in PA simplifications related to the relative importance of lateral 
flow in the Magenta versus the Culebra, which will be discussed later in this chapter and in 
Section 6.4.6.

Public concern was expressed that groundwater flow to the spring supplying brine to Laguna 
Grande de la Sal could be related to the presence of karst features.  The EPA examined 
information regarding the hydrology of the units above the Salado and DOE’s conceptualization 
of the groundwater flow model, including supplementary information submitted in letters dated 
May 2, 1997 (Docket A-93-02, Item V-B-6 (6)), and May 14, 1997 (Docket A-93-02, Item II-I-
31), and the EPA concluded that the information was adequate.

The EPA concluded, based on WIPP field observations and site-specific hydrologic information, 
there is no indication that any cavernous or other karst-related flow is present within the WIPP 
site boundary. The EPA concurred with DOE’s conceptualization of groundwater flow in the 
Culebra, which includes the presence of fractures within the Culebra and recharge and discharge 
areas for groundwater that are more consistent with potential discharge to areas south and west 
of the WIPP.

The Rustler is of particular importance for WIPP because it contains the most transmissive units 
above the repository.  Fluid flow in the Rustler is characterized by very slow rates of vertical 
leakage through confining layers and faster lateral flow in conductive units.  To illustrate this 
point, regional modeling with the groundwater basin model indicates that lateral specific

discharges in the Culebra, for example, are perhaps two to three orders of magnitude greater than 
the vertical specific discharges across the top of the Culebra.

Because of its importance, the Rustler continues to be the focus of studies to understand better 
the complex relationship between hydrologic properties and geology, particularly in view of 
water-level rises observed in the Culebra and Magenta (e.g., SNL 2003a; also see Appendix 
DATA).  An example of the complex nature of Rustler hydrology is the variation in Culebra 
transmissivity (T).  Culebra T varies over three orders of magnitude on the WIPP site itself and 
over six orders of magnitude on the scale of the regional groundwater basin model with lower T 
east of the site and higher T west of the site in Nash Draw (e.g., Beauheim and Ruskauff 1998).  
As discussed below, site investigations and studies (e.g., Holt and Powers 1988; Beauheim and 
Holt 1990; Powers and Holt 1995; Holt 1997; Holt and Yarbrough 2002; Powers et al. 2003) 
suggest that the variability in Culebra T can be explained largely by the thickness of Culebra 
overburden, the location and extent of upper Salado dissolution, and the occurrence of halite in 
the mudstone units bounding the Culebra (see Section 2.1.3.5).

2.2.1.4.1.1  Los Medaños 
The unnamed lower member was named the Los Medaños by Powers and Holt (1999). The Los 
Medaños is treated as a single hydrostratigraphic unit in WIPP models of the Rustler, although 
its composition varies. Overall, it acts as a confining layer. The basal interval of the Los 
Medaños, approximately 19.5 m (64 ft) thick, is composed of siltstone, mudstone, and claystone 
and contains the water-producing zones of the lowermost Rustler.  Transmissivities of 2.9 ×10-10

m2/s (2.7 × 10-4 ft2/day) and 2.4 × 10-10 m2/s (2.2 × 10-4 ft2/day) were reported by Beauheim 
(1987a, p. 50) from tests at well H-16 that included this interval.  The porosity of the Los 
Medaños was measured in 1995 as part of testing at the H-19 hydropad (TerraTek 1996). Two 
claystone samples had effective porosities of 26.8 and 27.3 percent. One anhydrite sample had an 
effective porosity of 0.2 percent.  The transmissivity values correspond to hydraulic 
conductivities of 1.5 × 10-11 m/s (4.2 × 10-6 ft/day) and 1.2 × 10-11 m/s (3.4 × 10-6 ft/day).  
Hydraulic conductivity in the lower portion of the Los Medaños is believed by the DOE to 
increase to the west in and near Nash Draw, where dissolution at the underlying Rustler-Salado 
contact has caused subsidence and fracturing of the sandstone and siltstone. 
30 
31 
32 
33 
34 
The remainder of the Los Medaños contains mudstones, anhydrite, and variable amounts of 
halite.  The hydraulic conductivity of these lithologies is extremely low.  It is for this reason the 
Los Medaños is treated as a single hydrostratigraphic unit that overall acts as a confining unit. 
The conceptual model incorporating the Los Medaños is discussed in Section 6.4.6.1.  Important 
hydrologic model properties of the Los Medaños are summarized in Appendix PA.

As described in Section 2.1.3.5, the Los Medaños contains two mudstone layers: one in the 
middle of the Los Medaños and one immediately below the Culebra.  An anhydrite layer 
separates the two mudstones.  The lower and upper Los Medaños mudstones have been given the 
designations M1/H1 and M2/H2, respectively, by Holt and Powers (1988).  This naming 
convention is used to indicate the presence of halite in the mudstone at some locations at and 
near the WIPP site.  Powers (2002a) has mapped (Figure 2-15) the margins delineating the 
occurrence of halite in both mudstone layers.  Whereas early researchers (e.g., Snyder 1985) 
interpreted the absence of halite west of these margins as evidence of dissolution, Holt and

Powers (1988) interpreted it as reflecting changes in the depositional environment, not 
dissolution.  However, Holt and Powers (1988) concluded that dissolution of Rustler halite may 
have occurred along the present-day margins.  The presence of halite in the Los Medaños 
mudstones is likely to affect the conductivity of the mudstones, but its greater importance is the 
implications it has for the conductivity of the Culebra.  As discussed in Section 2.2.1.4.1.2, the 
Culebra transmissivity in locations where halite is present in M2/H2 and M3/H3 (a mudstone in 
the lower Tamarisk Member of the Rustler) is assumed to be an order of magnitude lower than 
where halite does not occur (Holt and Yarbrough 2002).

Fluid pressures in the Los Medaños have been continuously measured at well H-16 since 1987.  
During this period, the fluid pressure has remained relatively constant at between 190 and 195 
psi or a head of approximately 137 m (450 ft).  Given the location of the pressure transducer (an 
elevation of 811.96 m amsl), the current elevation of the Los Medaños water level at H-16 is 
approximately 949 m amsl.  No other wells in the WIPP monitoring network are completed to 
the Los Medaños.  Thus, H-16 provides the only current head information for this member.

The Culebra is of interest because it is the most transmissive saturated unit above the WIPP 
repository and hydrologic research has been concentrated on the unit for nearly two decades.  
Although it is relatively thin, it is an entire hydrostratigraphic unit in the WIPP hydrological 
conceptual model, and it is the most important conductive unit in this model.  Implementation of 
the Culebra in the conceptual model is discussed in detail in Section 6.4.6.2.  Model discussions 
cover groundwater flow and transport characteristics of the Culebra.  These are supported by 
parameter values in Table 6-20, 6-21, 6-22, and 6-23.  Additional background for the Culebra 
model is in CCA Appendix MASS, Sections MASS.14 and MASS.15. 
24 
25 
The two primary types of field tests used to characterize the flow and transport characteristics of 
the Culebra are hydraulic tests and tracer tests.

The hydraulic testing consists of pumping, injection, and slug testing of wells across the study 
area (for example, Beauheim 1987a, p. 3).  The most detailed hydraulic test data exist for the 
WIPP hydropads (for example, H-19).  The hydropads generally comprise a network of three or 
more wells located within a few tens of meters of each other.  Long-term pumping tests have 
been conducted at hydropads H-3, H-11, and H-19 and at well WIPP-13 (Beauheim 1987b; 
1989; Beauheim et al. 1995; Meigs et al. 2000).  These pumping tests provided transient pressure 
data at the hydropad and over a much larger area.  Tests often included use of automated data-
acquisition systems, providing high-resolution (in both space and time) data sets.  In addition to 
long-term pumping tests, slug tests and short-term pumping tests have been conducted at 
individual wells to provide pressure data that can be used to interpret the transmissivity at that 
well (Beauheim 1987a).  (Additional short-term pumping tests have been conducted in the 
WQSP wells [Beauheim and Ruskauff 1998]).  Detailed cross-hole hydraulic testing has been 
conducted at the H-19 hydropad (Beauheim 2000). 
39 
40

The hydraulic tests are designed to yield pressure data for the interpretation of such 
characteristics as transmissivity, permeability, and storativity.  The pressure data from long-term 
pumping tests and the interpreted transmissivity values for individual wells are used for the

generation of transmissivity fields in PA flow modeling (see Appendix PA, Attachment TFIELD, 
Sections TFIELD 5.0 and TFIELD-6.0).  Some of the hydraulic test data and interpretations are 
also important for the interpretation of transport characteristics.  For instance, information about 
the vertical distribution of permeability interpreted from the hydraulic tests at a given hydropad 
is needed for interpretations of tracer test data at that hydropad.

To evaluate transport properties of the Culebra, a series of tracer tests were conducted at six 
locations (the H-2, H-3, H-4, H-6, H-11, and H-19 hydropads) near the WIPP site.  Tests at the 
first five of these locations consisted of two-well dipole tests and/or multiwell convergent flow 
tests and are described in detail in Jones et al. (1992).  Tracer tests at the H-19 hydropad and 
additional tracer tests performed at the H-11 hydropad are described in Meigs et al. (2000).  The 
1995-1996 tracer test program consisted of single-well injection-withdrawal tests and multi-well 
convergent flow tests (Meigs and Beauheim 2001).  Unique features of this testing program 
include the single-well test at both H-19 and H-11, the injection of tracers into six wells during 
the H-19 convergent-flow test, the injection of tracer into upper and lower zones of the Culebra 
at the H-19 hydropad, repeated injections under different convergent-flow pumping rates, and the 
use of tracers with different free-water diffusion coefficients.  The 1995-1996 tracer tests were 
specifically designed to evaluate the importance of heterogeneity (both horizontal and vertical) 
and diffusion on transport processes.

The Culebra is a fractured dolomite with nonuniform properties both horizontally and vertically.  
Examination of core and shaft exposures has revealed that there are multiple scales of porosity 
within the Culebra including fractures ranging from microscale to potentially large, vuggy zones, 
and interparticle and intercrystalline porosity (Holt 1997).  Porosity measurements made on core 
samples give porosity measurements ranging from 0.03 to 0.30 (Kelley and Saulnier 1990; 
TerraTek 1996).  This large range in porosity for small samples is expected given the variety of 
porosity types within the Culebra.  However, the effective porosity for flow and transport at 
larger scales will have a smaller range due to the effects of spatial averaging.  The core 
measurements indicate that the Culebra has significant quantities of connected porosity.

Flow in the Culebra occurs within fractures, within vugs where they are connected by fractures, 
and to some extent within interparticle porosity where the porosity (and permeability) is high, 
such as chalky lenses.  At any given location, flow will occur in response to hydraulic gradients 
in all places that are permeable.  When the permeability contrast between different scales of 
connected porosity is large, the total porosity can effectively be conceptualized by dividing the 
system into advective porosity (often referred to as fracture porosity) and diffusive porosity 
(often referred to as matrix porosity).  The advective porosity can be defined as the portion of the 
porosity where flow is the dominant process (for example fractures and to some extent vugs 
connected by fractures and interparticle porosity).  Diffusive porosity can be defined as the 
portion of the porosity where diffusion is the dominant process (for example, intercrystalline 
porosity and to some extent microfractures, vugs and portions of the interparticle porosity.) 
39 
40 
41 
42 
43 
For the Culebra in the vicinity of the WIPP site, defining advective porosity is not a simple 
matter.  In some regions the permeability of the fractures is inferred to be significantly larger 
than the permeability of the other porosity types, thus advective porosity can be conceptualized 
as predominantly fracture porosity (low porosity).  In some regions, there appear to be no high 
permeability fractures.  This may be due to a lack of large fractures or may be the result of

gypsum fillings in a portion of the porosity.  Where permeability contrasts between porosity 
types are small, the advective porosity can be conceptualized as a combination of fractures, vugs 
connected by fractures, and permeable portions of the interparticle porosity.  In each case, the 
diffusive porosity can be conceptualized as the porosity where advection is not dominant.

The major physical transport processes that affect actinide transport through the Culebra include 
advection (through fractures and other permeable porosity), diffusion from the advective porosity 
into the rest of the connected porosity (diffusive porosity) and dispersive spreading due to 
heterogeneity.  Diffusion can be an important process for effectively retarding solutes by 
transferring mass from the porosity where advection (flow) is the dominant process into other 
portions of the rock.  Diffusion into stagnant portions of the rock also provides access to 
additional surface area for sorption. Further discussion of transport of actinides in the Culebra as 
either dissolved species or as colloids is given in Section 6.4.6.2.  Parameter values determined 
from tests of the Culebra are given in CCA Appendix PAR and are described in Section 
6.4.6.2.2.  A summary of input values to the conceptual model is in Tables 6-22 and 6-23.

Fluid flow in the Culebra is dominantly lateral and southward except in discharge areas along the 
west or south boundaries of the basin.  Where transmissive fractures exist, flow is dominated by 
fractures but may also occur in vugs connected by microfractures and interparticle porosity.  
Regions where flow is dominantly through vugs connected by microfractures and interparticle 
porosity have been inferred from pumping tests and tracer tests.  Flow in the Culebra may be 
concentrated along zones that are thinner than the total thickness of the Culebra.  In general, the 
upper portion of the Culebra is massive dolomite with a few fractures and vugs, and appears to 
have low permeability.  The lower portion of the Culebra appears to have many more vuggy and 
fractured zones and to have significantly higher permeability (Meigs and Beauheim 2001).

There is strong evidence that the permeability of the Culebra varies spatially and varies 
sufficiently that it cannot be characterized with a uniform value or range over the region of 
interest to the WIPP.  The transmissivity of the Culebra varies spatially over six orders of 
magnitude from east to west in the vicinity of the WIPP (Figure 2-34).  Over the site, Culebra 
transmissivity varies over three to four orders of magnitude.  CCA Appendix TFIELD, Section 
TFIELD.2 contains the data used to develop Figure 2-34, which shows variation in 
transmissivity in the Culebra in the WIPP region.  Attachment TFIELD to Appendix P provides 
the modeling rationale and addresses how data collected over a number of years were correlated 
for the generation of transmissivity fields.

variations in depositional environments were small within the mapped region, and primary 
features of the Culebra show little map-scale spatial variability, according to Holt and Powers 
(CCA Appendix FAC).  Direct measurements of the density of open fractures are not available 
from core samples because of incomplete recovery and fracturing during drilling, but observation 
of the relatively unfractured exposures in the WIPP shafts suggests that the density of open 
fractures in the Culebra decreases to the east.

Recent investigations have made a significant contribution to the understanding of the large 
variability observed for Culebra transmissivity (e.g., Holt and Powers 1988; Beauheim and Holt 
1990; Powers and Holt 1995; Holt 1997; Holt and Yarbrough 2002; Powers et al. 2003).  The 
spatial distribution of Culebra transmissivity is believed to be due strictly to deterministic post-
depositional processes and geologic controls (Holt and Yarbrough 2002).  The important 
geologic controls include Culebra overburden thickness, dissolution of the upper Salado, and the 
occurrence of halite in the mudstone Rustler units (M2/H2 and M3/H3) above and below the 
Culebra (Holt and Yarbrough 2002).  Culebra transmissivity is inversely related to thickness of 
overburden because stress relief associated with erosion of overburden (see Section 2.1.5.2) 
leads to fracturing and opening of preexisting fractures.  Culebra transmissivity is high where 
dissolution of the upper Salado has occurred and the Culebra has subsided and fractured.  
Culebra transmissivity is observed to be low where halite is present in overlying and/or 
underlying mudstones.  Presumably, high Culebra transmissivity leads to dissolution of nearby 
halite (if any).  Hence, the presence of halite in mudstones above and/or below the Culebra can

The Culebra has been tested hydraulically at 42 locations, yielding reliable transmissivity values.  
These values (log T) are plotted as a function of depth to Culebra (overburden thickness) in 
Figure 2-35.  As shown, the Culebra transmissivities fall into two populations separated by a 
cutoff (termed ‘high-T’ cutoff) equal to -5.4 (log T [m2/s]).  These data suggest a bimodal 
distribution for transmissivity with one population having high transmissivity and the other low 
transmissivity, with the difference attributed to open, interconnected fractures (“fracture 
interconnectivity”) for the high-transmissivity population (Holt and Yarbrough 2002).  Using 
these data, Holt and Yarbrough (2002) constructed a linear Culebra transmissivity model relating 
log T to the deterministic geologic controls described above.  The linear model is expressed as 
follows:

or 0 when log T (m2/s) < -5.4), and ID (x) is the dissolution indicator (equal to 1 when Salado 
dissolution has occurred at (x) and 0 when it has not).  In this model, coefficient β1 is the 
intercept value, β2 is the slope of Y(x)/d(x), and  β3 and  β4  represent adjustments to the intercept 
for the occurrence of open, interconnected fractures and Salado dissolution, respectively.  Based 
on linear-regression analysis, Holt and Yarbrough (2002) estimated the coefficients in Equation

IH (x) is a halite indicator function equal to 1 in locations where halite occurs in both the M2/H2

In the region east of the upper Salado dissolution margin and west of the M2/H2 and M3/H3 
margins, high transmissivity depends, in part, on the absence of gypsum fracture fillings.  No 
method has yet been determined for predicting whether fractures will or will not be filled with 
gypsum at a given location, so the distribution of high and low transmissivity is treated 
stochastically in this region.  Predictions of transmissivity in this region make use of an isotropic 
spherical variogram model.  Fitted parameters for the variogram model are described in 
Attachment TFIELD (Section TFIELD-4.3) of Appendix PA.

Geochemical and radioisotope characteristics of the Culebra have been studied.  There is 
considerable variation in groundwater geochemistry in the Culebra.  The variation has been 
described in terms of different hydrogeochemical facies that can be mapped in the Culebra (see 
Section 2.4.2).  A halite-rich hydrogeochemical facies exists in the region of the WIPP site and 
to the east, approximately corresponding to the regions in which halite exists in units above and 
below the Culebra  (Figure 2-15), and in which a large portion of the Culebra fractures are 
gypsum filled (Figure 2-17).  An anhydrite-rich hydrogeochemical facies exists west and south 
of the WIPP site, where there is relatively less halite in adjacent strata and where there are fewer 
gypsum-filled fractures.  
The Culebra groundwater geochemistry studies continue.  Culebra water quality is evaluated 
semiannually at six wells, three north (WQSP-1, WQSP-2, and WQSP-3) and three south 
(WQSP-4, WQSP-5, and WQSP-6) (WIPP MOC 1995) of the surface structures area (see Figure 
2-3 for well locations).  Five rounds of semiannual sampling of water quality completed before 
the first receipt of waste at the WIPP were used to establish the initial Culebra water-quality 
baseline for major ion species including Na+, Ca2+, Mg2

five additional rounds of sampling that were completed before first receipt of RCRA-regulated 
waste (IT Corporation 2000).  Table 2-8 gives the 95 percent confidence intervals presented in 
SNL (2001) for the major ion species determined from the 10 rounds (semiannual sampling for 5 
years) of baseline sampling.  Culebra water quality is extremely variable among the six sampling 
wells, as shown by the Cl- concentrations that range from approximately 6,000 mg/L at WQSP-6 
to 130,000 mg/L at WQSP-3.

Radiogenic isotopic signatures suggest that the age of the groundwater in the Culebra is on the 
order of 10,000 years or more (see, for example, Lambert 1987, Lambert and Carter 1987, and 
Lambert and Harvey 1987).  The radiogenic ages of the Culebra groundwater and the 
geochemical differences provide information potentially relevant to the groundwater flow 
directions and groundwater interaction with other units and are important constraints on

conceptual models of groundwater flow.  Previous conceptual models of the Culebra (see for 
example, Chapman 1986, Chapman 1988, LaVenue et al. 1990, and Siegel et al. 1991) have not 
been able to consistently relate the hydrogeochemical facies, radiogenic ages, and flow 
constraints (that is, transmissivity, boundary conditions, etc.) in the Culebra.

The groundwater basin modeling that was conducted, although it did not model solute transport 
processes, provides flow fields that can be used to develop the following concepts that help 
explain the observed hydrogeochemical facies and radiogenic ages.  The groundwater basin 
model combines and tests three fundamental processes:  (1) it calculates vertical leakage, which 
may carry solutes into the Culebra; (2) it calculates lateral fluxes in the Culebra (directions as 
well as rates); and (3) it calculates a range of possible effects of climate change.  The presence of 
the halite-rich groundwater facies is explained by vertical leakage of solutes into the Culebra 
from the overlying halite-containing Tamarisk by advective or diffusive processes.  Because 
lateral flow rates here are low, even slow rates of solute transport into the Culebra can result in 
high solute concentration.  Vertical leakage occurs slowly over the entire model region, and thus 
the age of groundwater in the Culebra is old, consistent with radiogenic information.  Lateral 
fluxes within the anhydrite zone are larger because of higher transmissivity, and where the halite 
and anhydrite facies regions converge, the halite facies signature is lost by dilution with 
relatively large quantities of anhydrite facies groundwater.  Response of groundwater flow in the 
Culebra as the result of increasing recharge is modeled through the variation in climate, 
discussed in Section 6.4.9.

Groundwater levels in the Culebra in the WIPP region were measured prior to the CCA in 
numerous wells (Figure 2-2). The Culebra monitoring wells as of the end of 2002 are shown in 
Figures 2-3 and 2-4; plugged and abandoned wells are not shown in these figures.  Beginning in

long-term rise has been observed in both Culebra and Magenta water levels (Figure 2-36) over a 
broad area of the WIPP site including Nash Draw (SNL 2003a).  At the time of the CCA this 
long-term rise was recognized, but was thought (outside of Nash Draw) to represent recovery 
from the accumulation of hydraulic tests that had occurred since the late 1970s and the effects of 
grouting around the WIPP shafts to limit leakage.  Water levels in Nash Draw were thought to 
respond to changes in the volumes of potash mill effluent discharged into the draw (Silva 1996); 
however, correlation of these water levels with potash mine discharge cannot be proven because 
sufficient data on the timing and volumes of discharge are not available.  As the rise in water 
levels has continued since 1996, observed heads have exceeded the ranges of uncertainty 
established for the steady-state heads in most of the 32 wells used in the calibration of the 
transmissivity fields described in CCA Appendix TFIELD.  Although recovery from the 
hydraulic tests and shaft leakage has unquestionably occurred, the DOE has implemented a 
program to identify other potential causes for the water-level rises (SNL 2003b).

Potentiometric surface maps of the freshwater head in the Culebra in December 1998 and 
December 2002 are shown in Figures 2-37a, 2-37b and 2-37c, respectively.  The maps are 
generally similar and indicate no changes in flow directions across the WIPP site over that 
period.  Figure 2-37c shows the changes in heads at the wells monitored in both December 1998 
and December 2002.  Freshwater heads in most wells increased by 2-4 ft from 1998 to 2002.  
The largest rise was 4.84 ft at DOE-1.  Only one well, AEC-7, showed a drop over this period (-
0.85 ft) larger than potential measurement error.

Although Culebra heads have been rising, the head distribution in the Culebra (see Figures 2-
37a, 2-37b and 2-37c) is consistent with groundwater basin modeling results (discussed in 
Appendix PA, Attachment MASS, Section MASS.14.2) indicating that the generalized direction 
of groundwater flow remains north to south.  However, caution should be used when making 
assumptions based on groundwater-level data alone.  Studies in the Culebra have shown that 
fluid density variations in the Culebra can affect flow direction (Davies 1989, p. 35).  The 
fractured nature of the Culebra, coupled with variable fluid densities, can also cause localized 
flow patterns to differ from general flow patterns.  Water-level rises in the vicinity of the H-9 
hydropad, about 10.46 km (6.5 mi) south of the site, are not thought to be caused by either WIPP 
activities or potash mining discharge and have been included in the DOE program to investigate 
Culebra water-level rises in general.  The DOE continues to monitor groundwater levels 
throughout the region, but only water-level changes at or near the site have the potential to 
impact the prediction of disposal system performance. The DOE has implemented water-level 
changes in its conceptual model through variations in climate as discussed in Section 6.4.9.  
These variations bring the water table to the surface for some calculations. The DOE has also 
used recent (late 2000) Culebra heads in flow and transport calculations for this recertification 
application, as discussed in Appendix PA, Attachment TFIELD, Section TFIELD-6.2.

Inferences about vertical flow directions in the Culebra have been made from well data collected 
by the DOE.  Beauheim (1987a) reported flow directions toward the Culebra from both the Los 
Medaños and the Magenta over the WIPP site, indicating that the Culebra acts as a drain for the 
units around it.  This indication is consistent with results of groundwater basin modeling.  A 
more detailed discussion of Culebra flow and transport can be found in Appendix PA,

In response to an EPA letter dated March 19, 1997 (Docket A-93-02, Item II-I-17), supplemental 
information to the CCA pertinent to groundwater flow and geochemistry within the Culebra was 
provided by the DOE in a letter dated May 14, 1997 (Docket A-93-02, Item II-I-31).  In that 
letter, the DOE explained the conceptual model of Culebra groundwater flow used in the CCA.  
The CCA conceptual model, referred to as the groundwater basin model, offers a three-
dimensional approach to treatment of supra-Salado rock units, and assumes that vertical leakage 
(albeit very slow) occurs between rock units of the Rustler (where hydraulic gradients exist).  
Flow in the Culebra is considered transient, but is not expected to change significantly over the 
next 10,000 years. This differs from previous interpretations, wherein no flow was assumed 
between the Rustler units.  
34 
35 
36 
37 
38 
In an attachment to the May 14, 1997 letter, the DOE concluded that the presence of anhydrite 
within the Rustler units did not preclude slow downward infiltration, as previously argued by the 
DOE, and that the observed geochemistry and flow directions can be explained with different 
recharge areas and Culebra travel paths.  The EPA reviewed the groundwater flow and recharge 
conceptualization and concluded that it provides a realistic representation of site conditions.

During the CCA review, the EPA found that information on the Culebra in the CCA lacked a 
detailed discussion on the origin of the transmissivity variations relative to fracture 
infill/dissolution, integration of climatic change, and loading/unloading events.  These are 
important aspects to understanding not only current transmissivity differences, but also potential 
future transmissivity variations that could affect PA calculations.  The EPA’s review stated, 
however, that the determination of the specific origin of fractures was not necessary because 
conditions were not expected to change during the regulatory period.

The DOE provided supplemental information in letters in 1997 (Docket A-93-02, Items II-I-03, 
II-I-24, II-I-31, II-H-44, and II-H-46) indicating that dissolution of fracture fill (which has the 
potential to alter fracture permeability) is unlikely to occur.  The EPA accepted the DOE’s 
position that infiltrating waters would most likely become saturated with calcium sulfate and 
consequently would not dissolve anhydrite or gypsum fracture fill.  Further information on the 
EPA review of anhydrite and gypsum fracture fill dissolution is contained in EPA Technical 
Support Document for Section 194.14:  Content of Compliance Certification Application, 
Section IV.C (Docket A-93-02, Item V-B-3).

The Sandia National Laboratories Annual Compliance Monitoring Parameter Assessment reports 
the annual assessment of the Compliance Monitoring Parameters (COMPs) pursuant to the SNL 
Analysis Plan, AP-069. The first assessment, for calendar year 1998 (SNL 2000a), showed that 
changes in Culebra water levels were considered minor. During the assessment of the COMP 
‘changes in groundwater flow’ for calendar year 2001 (SNL 2002), estimated freshwater Culebra 
heads in 15 wells were identified as above the ranges of uncertainty estimated for steady-state 
conditions at those wells.  At 8 of the 15 wells, the measured water levels exceed the uncertainty 
range before being converted to freshwater head.  In these cases, conversion to freshwater head 
using any feasible fluid density can only increase the deviation from the range.  The freshwater 
head values from late 2000 were used to calibrate the Culebra transmissivity (T) fields used to 
simulate the transport of radionuclides through the Culebra (Appendix PA, Attachment 
TFIELD).

Because transport through the Culebra is a minor component of the total predicted releases from 
the repository, these changes in head values have little or no effect on the total releases to the 
accessible environment.  The COMP assessment for the calendar year 2001 concluded that the 
current head values do not indicate a condition adverse to the predicted performance of the 
repository.  However, because Culebra water levels are above expected values at most wells, 
work has been initiated to investigate the reason for the change and further evaluate the impact 
on performance.

Additional background for the Culebra model is in Appendix PA, Attachment TFIELD.  
Additional information on long-term pumping test data is documented in Meigs et al. (2000) and 
slug tests and short-term pumping tests are documented in Beauheim et al. (1991b) and 
Beauheim and Ruskauff (1998).

Several new publications on the Culebra updating the original CCA information have been 
released.  Transport properties and tracer tests of the Culebra performed at the H-11 and H-19 
hydropads are described in Meigs et al. (2000).  The 1995-96 tracer test program, which 
consisted of single-well injection-withdrawal tests and multiwell convergent flow tests, is 
documented in Meigs and Beauheim (2001).  The higher permeability of the lower Culebra has 
been addressed in Meigs and Beauheim (2001, p. 1116).

The Tamarisk acts as a confining layer in the groundwater basin model.  Attempts were made in 
two wells, H-14 and H-16, to test a 2.4-m (7.9-ft) sequence of the Tamarisk that consists of 
claystone, mudstone, and siltstone overlain and underlain by anhydrite.  Permeability was too

low to measure in either well within the time allowed for testing; consequently, Beauheim 
(1987a, pp. 108-110) estimated the transmissivity of the claystone sequence to be one or more 
orders of magnitude less than that of the tested interval in the Los Medaños (that is, less than 
approximately 2.7 × 10
-11 m2/s [2.5 × 10-5 ft2/day]).  The porosity of the Tamarisk was measured 
in 1995 as part of testing at the H-19 hydropad (TerraTek 1996).  Two claystone samples had an 
effective porosity of 21.3 to 21.7 percent.  Five anhydrite samples had effective porosities of 0.2 
to 1.0 percent.

Fluid pressures in the Tamarisk have been measured continuously at well H-16 since 1987.  
From 1998 through 2002, the pressures increased approximately 20 psi, from 80 to 100 psi (185 
to 230 ft of water), probably in a continuing recovery response to shaft grouting conducted in 
1993 to reduce leakage.  Given the location of the pressure transducer, the elevation of Tamarisk 
water level has increased from 899 to 913 m amsl (2,950 to 2,995 ft amsl) during this period.  
Currently, no other wells in the WIPP monitoring network are completed to the Tamarisk.  Thus, 
H-16 provides the only information on Tamarisk head levels. 
15 
16 
17 
18 
19 
Similar to the Los Medaños, the Tamarisk includes a mudstone layer (M3/H3) that contains 
halite in some locations at and around the WIPP site.  This layer is considered to be important 
because of the effect it has on the spatial distribution of transmissivity of the Culebra as 
described in Section 2.2.1.4.1.2.  The M3/H3 margin is described in Section 2.1.3.5 and mapped 
in Figure 2-15.

The Tamarisk is incorporated into the conceptual model as discussed in Section 6.4.6.3.  The role 
of the Tamarisk in the groundwater basin model is in CCA Appendix MASS, Section 
MASS.14.1.  Tamarisk hydrological model parameters are in Appendix PA, Attachment PAR,

The Magenta is a conductive hydrostratigraphic unit about 7.9 m (26 ft) thick at the WIPP.  The 
Magenta is saturated except near outcrops along Nash Draw, and hydraulic data are available 
from 22 wells including 7 wells recompleted to the Magenta between 1995 and 2002 (SNL 
2003a).  According to Mercer (CCA Appendix HYDRO, p. 65), transmissivity ranges over five 
orders of magnitude from 1 × 10-9 to 4 × 10-4 m2/s (4 × 10-3 to 3.75 × 102 ft2/day ).  A slug test 
performed in H-9c, a recompleted Magenta well (see Figure 2-5 for well location), yielded a 
transmissivity of 6 × 10-7 m2/s (0.56 ft2/day), which is consistent with Mercer’s findings (SNL 
2003a).  The porosity of the Magenta was measured in 1995 as part of testing at the H-19 
hydropad (TerraTek 1996).  Four samples had effective porosities ranging from 2.7 to 25.2 
percent.

The hydraulic transmissivities of the Magenta, based on sparse data, show a decrease from west 
to east, with slight indentations of the contours north and south of the WIPP that correspond to 
the topographic expression of Nash Draw.  In most locations, the hydraulic conductivity of the 
Magenta is one to two orders of magnitude less than that of the Culebra.  The Magenta does not 
have hydraulically significant fractures in the vicinity of the WIPP.  Treatment of the Magenta in 
the model is discussed in Section 6.4.6.4 with modeling parameters in Table 6-24.

Based on Magenta water levels measured in the 1980s (Lappin et al. 1989) when a wide network 
of Magenta monitoring wells existed, the hydraulic gradient in the Magenta across the site varies 
from 3 to 4 m/km (16 to 20 ft/mi) on the eastern side, steepening to about 6 m/km (32 ft/mi) 
along the western side near Nash Draw (Figure 2-38).

Regional modeling using the groundwater basin model indicates that leakage occurs into the 
Magenta from the overlying Forty-niner and out of the Magenta downward into the Tamarisk.  
Regional modeling also indicates that flow directions in the Magenta are dominantly westward, 
similar to the slope of the land surface in the immediate area of the WIPP.  This flow direction is 
different than the dominant flow direction in the next underlying conductive unit, the Culebra.  
This difference is consistent with the groundwater basin conceptual model, in that flow in 
shallower units is expected to be more sensitive to local topography. 
12 
13 
14 
Inferences about vertical flow directions in the Magenta have been made from well data 
collected by the DOE.  Beauheim (1987a, p. 137) reported flow directions downwards out of the 
Magenta over the WIPP site, consistent with results of groundwater basin modeling.   
15 
16 
17 
18 
19 
However, Beauheim (1987a, p. 139) concluded that flow directions between the Forty-niner and 
Magenta would be upward in the three boreholes from which reliable pressure data are available 
for the Forty-niner (H-3, H-14, and H-16), which is not consistent with the results of 
groundwater modeling.  This inconsistency may be the result of local heterogeneity in rock 
properties that affect flow on a scale that cannot be duplicated in regional modeling. 
20 
21

23 
As is the case for the Culebra, groundwater elevations in the Magenta have changed over the 
period of observation.  The pattern of changes is similar to that observed for the Culebra (see 
Section 2.2.1.4.1.2), and is being investigated under the current DOE hydrology program (SNL 
2003b).

The Forty-niner is a confining hydrostratigraphic layer about 20 m (66 ft) thick throughout the 
WIPP area and consists of low-permeability anhydrite and siltstone.  Tests by Beauheim (1987a, 
119-123 and Table 5-2) in H-14 and H-16 yielded transmissivities of about 3 × 10-8 to 8 × 10-8 
m2/s (3 × 10-2 to 7 × 10-2 ft2/day) and 3 × 10-9 to 6 × 10-9 m2/s (5 × 10-3 to 6 × 10-3 ft2/day), 
respectively, for the medial siltstone unit of the Forty-niner.  Tests of the siltstone in H-3d 
provided transmissivity estimates of 3.8 × 10-9 to 4.8 × 10-9 m2/s (3.5 × 10-3 to 4.5 ×10-3 ft2/day) 
(Beauheim et al. 1991b, Table 5-1).  The porosity of the Forty-niner was measured as part of 
testing at the H-19 hydropad (TerraTek 1996).  Three claystone samples had effective porosities 
ranging from 9.1 to 24.0 percent.  Four anhydrite samples had effective porosities ranging from 
0.0 to 0.4 percent.  Model consideration of the Forty-niner is in Section 6.4.6.5.  Modeling 
parameters are in CCA Appendix PAR, Table PAR-27.

Fluid pressures in the Forty-niner have been measured continuously at well H-16, approximately 
13.9 m (45.6 ft) from the well of the AIS, since 1987.  The pressures cycle in a sinusoidal 
fashion on an annual basis.  These cycles correlate with cycles observed in rock bolt loads in the 
WIPP shafts (DOE 2002c), and presumably reflect seasonal temperature changes causing the 
rock around the shafts to expand and contract. From 1998 through 2002, the pressures have 
cycled between 40 and 70 psi (90 and 160 ft of fresh water).  Given the location of the pressure 
transducer, the elevation of Forty-niner water level has varied between 899 to 920 m (2,950 to 
3,020 ft) amsl during this period.  Through April 2002, Forty-niner water levels were also 
measured monthly at H-3d as part of the WIPP groundwater monitoring program.  Measurements 
were discontinued after April 2002 because of an obstruction in the well.  The April 2002 Forty-
niner water level elevation determined at H-3d was 942 m (3,092 ft) amsl.  Differences in Forty-
niner water levels at H-16 and H-3d are probably due, in part, to differences in the densities of 
the fluids in the wells.  No other wells in the WIPP monitoring network are completed to the 
Forty-niner.

The Dewey Lake and the Santa Rosa, and surficial soils, overlie the Rustler and are the 
uppermost hydrostratigraphic units considered by the DOE.  The Dewey Lake and overlying 
rocks are more permeable than the anhydrites at the top of the Rustler.  Consequently, basin 
modeling indicates that most (probably more than 70 percent) of the water that recharges the 
groundwater basin (that is, percolates into the Dewey Lake from surface water) flows only in the 
rocks above the Rustler.  As modeled, the rest leaks vertically through the upper anhydrites of 
the Rustler and into the Magenta or continues downward to the Culebra.  More flow occurs into 
the Rustler units at times of greater recharge.  Even though it carries most of the modeled 
recharge, lateral flow in the Dewey Lake is slow because of its low permeability in most areas. 
25 
26 
27 
28 
A saturated, perched-water zone has been identified in the lower Santa Rosa directly below the 
operational area of the WIPP (DOE 1999; INTERA 1997a; INTERA 1997b; DES 1997).  The 
zone occurred at a location that previously had been dry or only partially saturated.  Details are 
provided in Appendix DATA and a summary provided in Section 2.2.1.4.2.2.

The Dewey Lake contains a productive zone of saturation, probably under water-table 
conditions, in the southwestern to south-central portion of the WIPP site and south of the site.  
Several wells operated by the J.C. Mills Ranch south of the WIPP site produce sufficient 
quantities of water from the Dewey Lake to supply livestock.  Short-term production rates of 5.7 
to 6.8 m3/hr (25 to 30 gpm) were observed in boreholes P-9 (Jones 1978, Vol. 1., pp. 167- 168), 
WQSP-6, and WQSP-6a (see CCA Appendix USDW).  Based on a single hydraulic test 
conducted at WQSP-6a (Figure 2-6), Beauheim and Ruskauff (1998) estimated the transmissivity 
of a 7.3m (24ft) fractured section of the Dewey Lake at 3.9 × 10-4 m2/s (360 ft2/day).  The 
productive zone is typically found in the middle of the Dewey Lake, 55 to 81 m (180 to 265 ft) 
below ground surface and appears to derive much of its transmissivity from open fractures.  
Where present, the saturated zone may be perched or simply underlain by less transmissive rock.  
Fractures below the productive zone tend to be completely filled with gypsum.  Open fractures

the zone of saturation, at the H-1, H-2, and H-3 boreholes (CCA Appendix HYDRO, p. 69).

Under the groundwater monitoring program (Appendix MON-2004), water levels are measured 
in two Dewey Lake wells, WQSP-6a and H-3d, located south of the WIPP site center (Figure 2-
6).  Water levels in these two wells are currently 975 and 937 m (3,198 and 3,075 ft) amsl, 
respectively.  Water levels at WQSP-6a remain relatively constant.  Over the past several years, 
water levels at H-3d have risen about 0.3 m/yr (1 ft/yr).  Future changes in the Dewey Lake 
water table due to wetter conditions are part of the conceptual model discussed in Sections 6.4.6 
and 6.4.9.

Similar to the six Culebra WQSP wells (WQSP-1 through WQSP-6), Dewey Lake water quality 
is determined semiannually at WQSP-6a.  Baseline concentrations for major ion species have 
also been determined from ten rounds of sampling.  The 95 percent confidence intervals for the 
major ion species presented in SNL (2001) are shown in Table 2-9 and indicate the Dewey Lake 
water at this location is relatively fresh.  Major ion concentrations have been stable within the 
baseline 95 percent confidence intervals for all 14 rounds of sampling conducted through May 
2002 (Kehrman 2002).

Powers (1997) suggests that what distinguishes the low-transmissivity lower Dewey Lake from 
the high-transmissivity upper Dewey Lake is a change in natural cements from carbonate (above) 
to sulfate (below).  Resistivity logs correlate with this cement change and show a drop in 
porosity across the cement-change boundary.  Similarly, porosity measurements made on eight 
core samples from the Dewey Lake from well H-19b4 showed a range from 14.9 to 24.8 percent 
for the four samples from above the cement change, and a range from 3.5 to 11.6 percent for the 
four samples from below the cement change (TerraTek 1996).  In the vicinity of the surface 
structures area of the WIPP, Powers (1997) proposed the surface of the cement change is at a 
depth of approximately 50 to 55 m (165 to 180 ft), is irregular, and trends downward 
stratigraphically to the south and west of the site center.

During site characterization and initial construction of the WIPP shafts, the Dewey Lake did not 
produce water within the WIPP shafts or in boreholes in the immediate vicinity of the panels. 
However, since 1995, water has been observed leaking into the exhaust shaft at a depth of 
approximately 24.4 m (80 ft) at the location of the Dewey Lake/ Santa Rosa contact (Docket A-
93-02, Item number 11-1-07, 1999; INTERA 1997a; INTERA 1997b).  As described below in 
Section 2.2.1.4.2.2, the water is interpreted to be from an anthropogenic source, including 
infiltration from WIPP rainfall-runoff retention ponds and the WIPP salt storage area and

Saturation of the uppermost Dewey Lake was observed for the first time in 2001 as well C-2737 
was being drilled (Powers 2002c).  Well C-2811 was then installed nearby to monitor this zone 
(Powers and Stensrud 2003).  Because of the proximity of these two wells to the WIPP surface 
structures area, and the absence of water at this horizon when earlier wells were drilled, the 
saturation is assumed to be an extension of the anthropogenic waters described in the following 
section. 
9 
10 
11 
For modeling purposes, the hydraulic conductivity of the Dewey Lake, assuming saturation, is 
estimated to be 10-8 m/sec (3 × 10-3 ft/day), corresponding to the hydraulic conductivity of fine-
grained sandstone and siltstone (Davies 1989, p. 110).

The Dewey Lake is the uppermost important layer in the hydrological model.  Its treatment is

parameters are in Table 6-25 and in Appendix PA, Attachment PAR, Table PAR-22.

The Santa Rosa ranges from 0 to 91 m (0 to about 300 ft) thick and is present over the eastern 
half of the WIPP site.  It is absent over the western portion of the site.  It crops out northeast of 
Nash Draw.  The Santa Rosa near the WIPP site may have a naturalwater-saturated thickness of 
limited extent.  It has a porosity of about 13 percent and a specific capacity of 0.029 to 0.041 
L/s/m (0.14 to 0.20 gallons per minute per foot (gpm/ft) of drawdown, where it yields water in

In May 1995, a scheduled inspection of the WIPP exhaust shaft revealed water emanating from 
cracks in the concrete liner at a depth of approximately 24.4 m (80 ft) below the shaft collar.  
Because little or no groundwater had been encountered at this depth interval previously (Bechtel 
1979; DOE 1983; Holt and Powers 1984, 1986), the DOE implemented a program in early 1996 
to investigate the source and extent of the water.  The program included installation of wells and 
piezometers, hydraulic testing (pumping tests), water-quality sampling and analysis, and water-
level and precipitation monitoring (Docket A-93-02, Item number 11-1-07, DOE 1999; INTERA 
1997a; DES 1997; INTERA 1997b).

In the initial phases of the investigation, three wells (C-2505, C-2506, and C-2507) and 12 
piezometers (PZ-1 through PZ-12) were installed within the surface structures area of the WIPP 
site (Figure 2-39).  The three wells were located near the exhaust shaft and completed to the 
Santa Rosa/Dewey Lake contact (approximately 15 m [50 ft] below ground surface).  Similarly, 
the piezometers were also completed to the Santa Rosa/Dewey Lake contact (approximately 16 
to 23 m [55 to 75 ft] below ground surface).  All wells and piezometers, with the exception of 
PZ-8, encountered a saturated zone just above the Santa Rosa/Dewey Lake contact, but water did 
not appear to have percolated significantly into the Dewey Lake.  PZ-8, the piezometer located 
farthest to the east in the study area, was a dry hole. 
39

Subsequent to the well and piezometer installations, water-level, water-quality, and rainfall data 
were collected.  In addition, hydraulic tests were performed to estimate hydrologic properties and

water production rates.  These data suggest that the water present in the Santa Rosa below the 
WIPP surface structures area represents an unconfined, water-bearing horizon perched on top of

shaft show no apparent hydrologic communication between the Santa Rosa and other formations 
located stratigraphically below the Santa Rosa.

A water-level-surface map of the Santa Rosa in the vicinity of the WIPPsurface structures area 
indicates that a potentiometric high is located near the salt water evaporation pond and PZ-7 
(Figure 2-40).  The water level at PZ-7 is approximately 1 m (3.3 ft) higher than the water levels 
in any other wells or piezometers.  Water is presumed to move radially from this potentiometric 
high.  The areal extent of the water is larger than the 80-acre investigative area shown in Figure 
2-39 (DES 1997) as evidenced by drilling records of C-2737 (Powers 2002c) located outside of 
and south of the WIPP surface structures area that indicate a Santa Rosa/Dewey Lake perched-
water horizon at a depth of approximately 18 m (60 ft). The study of this water is ongoing.

Water-quality data for the perched Santa Rosa waters are highly variable and appear to be 
dominated by two anthropogenic sources:  (1) runoff of rainfall into and infiltration from the 
retention ponds located to the south of the WIPP surface facilities, and (2) infiltration of saline 
waters from the salt storage area, the salt storage evaporation pond, and perhaps remnants of the 
drilling and tailings pit used during the construction of the WIPP salt shaft.  The total dissolved 
solids (TDS) in the perched water range from less than 3,000 mg/L at PZ-10 to more than 
160,000 mg/L at PZ-3 (DES 1997).  Concentration contours are known to shift with time.  For 
example, the high-TDS zone centered at PZ-3 moved observably to the northeast toward PZ-9 
between February 1997 and October 2000 (DOE 2002b).

Hydraulic tests (Docket A-93-02, Item number 11-1-07, DOE; INTERA 1997a; DES 1997) 
conducted in the three wells and 12 piezometers indicate that the Santa Rosa behaves as a low-
permeability, unconfined aquifer perched on the Dewey Lake.  Hydraulic conductivity ranges 
from 2.6  × 10-8 to 5.5 × 10-5 m/s (7.4 × 10-3 to 16 ft/day).  The wells are capable of producing at 
rates of about 0.3 to 1.0 gpm.  The estimated storativity value for the Santa Rosa is 1 × 10-2.

The groundwater regimes in the Capitan Limestone, which is generally regarded as the northern 
boundary of the Delaware Basin, and Nash Draw have been evaluated by the DOE as part of the 
WIPP project because of their importance in some processes, notably dissolution features, that 
the DOE has determined to be of low probability at the WIPP site.

The Capitan Limestone (hereafter referred to as the Capitan), which outcrops in the southern end 
of the Guadalupe Mountains, is a massive limestone unit that grades basinward into recemented, 
partly dolomitized reef breccia and shelfward into bedded carbonates and evaporites.  A deeply 
incised submarine canyon near the Eddy-Lea county line has been identified (Hiss 1976).  This

canyon is filled with sediments of lower permeability than the Capitan and, according to Hiss 
(1975 p. 199), restricts fluid flow.  The hydraulic conductivity of the Capitan ranges from 3 × 
10-6 to 9 × 10-5 m/s (1 to 25 ft/day) in southern Lea County and is 1.7 × 10-5 m/s (5 ft/day) east 
of the Pecos River at Carlsbad (CCA Appendix HYDRO, p. 34).  Hiss (1975, p. 199) reported in 
1975 that average transmissivities around the northern and eastern margins of the Delaware 
Basin are 0.01 m2/s (10,000 ft2/day) in thick sections and 5.4 × 10-4 m2/s (500 ft2/day) in incised 
submarine canyons.  Water table conditions are found in the Capitan aquifer southwest of the 
Pecos River at Carlsbad; however, artesian conditions exist to the north and east. The hydraulic 
gradient to the southeast of the submarine canyon near the Eddy-Lea county line has been 
affected by large oil field withdrawals.  The Capitan is recharged by percolation through the 
northern shelf aquifers, by flow from the south and west from underlying basin aquifers (see 
information on the Bell Canyon, Section 2.2.1.2.1), and by direct infiltration at its outcrop in the 
Guadalupe Mountains.  The Capitan is important in the regional hydrology because breccia pipes 
in the Salado have formed over it, most likely in response to the effects of dissolution by 
groundwater flowing in the Castile along the base of the Salado.  See CCA Appendix DEF, 
Section DEF.3.1 for a more thorough discussion of breccia pipe formation.

As discussed in Sections 2.1.3.4 and 2.1.6.2.1, in Nash Draw the contact between the Rustler and 
the Salado is an unstructured residuum of gypsum, clay, and sandstone created by the dissolution 
of halite and has been known as the brine aquifer, Rustler-Salado residuum, and residuum.  The 
residuum is absent under the WIPP site.  It is clear that dissolution in Nash Draw occurred after 
deposition of the Rustler (see CCA Appendix DEF, Section DEF.3.2 for a discussion of lateral 
dissolution of the Rustler-Salado contact).  As described previously, the topographic low formed 
by Nash Draw is a groundwater divide in the groundwater basin conceptual model of the units 
above the Salado.  The brine aquifer is shown in Figure 2-41.

Robinson and Lang (1938) described the brine aquifer (Section 2.1.3.4) and suggested that the 
structural conditions that caused the development of Nash Draw might control the occurrence of 
the brine; thus, the brine aquifer boundary may coincide with the topographic surface expression 
of Nash Draw, as shown in Figure 2-33.  Their studies show brine concentrated along a strip 
from 3.3 to 13 km (2 to 8 mi) wide and about 43 km (26 mi) long.  Data from the test holes that 
Robinson and Lang (1938) drilled indicate that the residuum (containing the brine) ranges in 
thickness from 3 to 18 m (10.5 to 60 ft) and averages about 24 feet (7 meters).

Hydraulic properties were determined by Hale et al. (1954) primarily for the area between 
Malaga Bend on the Pecos River and Laguna Grande de la Sal.  They calculated a transmissivity 
value of 8.6 × 10-3 m2/s (8,000 ft2/day) and estimated the potentiometric gradient to be 
0.27 m/km (1.4 ft/mi).  In this area, the Rustler-Salado residuum apparently is part of a 
continuous hydrologic system, as evidenced by the coincident fluctuation of water levels in the 
test holes (as far away as Laguna Grande de la Sal) with pumping rates in irrigation wells along 
the Pecos River.

In the northern half of Nash Draw, the approximate outline of the brine aquifer as described by 
Robinson and Lang (1938) has been supported by drilling associated with the WIPP 
hydrogeologic studies.  These studies also indicate that the main differences in areal extent occur 
along the eastern side where the boundary is very irregular and, in places (test holes P-14 and H-
07), extends farther east than previously indicated by Robinson and Lang (1938).

32

Other differences from the earlier studies include the variability in thickness of residuum present 
in test holes WIPP-25 through WIPP-29.  These holes indicate thicknesses ranging from 3.3 m 
(11 ft) in WIPP-25 to 33 m (108 ft) in WIPP-29 in Nash Draw, compared to 2.4 m (8 ft) in test 
hole P-14, east of Nash Draw.  The specific geohydrologic mechanism that has caused 
dissolution to be greater in one area than in another is not apparent, although a general increase 
in chloride concentration in water from the north to the south may indicate the effects of 
movement down the natural hydraulic gradient in Nash Draw.

The average hydraulic gradient within the residuum in Nash Draw is about 1.9 m/km (10 ft/mi); 
in contrast, the average gradient at the WIPP site is 7.4 m/km (39 ft/mi) (CCA Appendix 
HYDRO, p. 50).  This difference reflects the changes in transmissivity, which are as much as 
five orders of magnitude greater in Nash Draw.  The transmissivity determined from aquifer tests 
in test holes completed in the Rustler-Salado contact residuum of Nash Draw ranges from

Hale et al. (1954) believed the Rustler-Salado contact residuum discharges to the alluvium near 
Malaga Bend on the Pecos River.  Because the confining beds in this area are probably fractured 
because of dissolution and collapse of the evaporites, the brine (under artesian head) moves up 
through these fractures into the overlying alluvium and then discharges into the Pecos River.

According to CCA Appendix HYDRO, p. 55, water in the Rustler-Salado contact residuum in 
Nash Draw contains the largest concentrations of dissolved solids in the WIPP area, ranging 
from 41,500 mg/L in borehole H-1 to 412,000 mg/L in borehole H-5c.  These waters are 
classified as brines.  The dissolved mineral constituents in the brine consist mostly of sulfates 
and chlorides of calcium, magnesium, sodium, and potassium; the major constituents are sodium 
and chloride.  Concentrations of the other major ions vary according to the spatial location of the 
sample, are probably directly related to the interaction of the brine and the host rocks, and reflect 
residence time within the rocks.  Residence time of the brine depends upon the transmissivity of 
the rock.  For example, the presence of large concentrations of potassium and magnesium in 
water is correlated with minimal permeability and a relatively undeveloped flow system.

The EPA’s initial review of the CCA found the discussion of the Rustler/Salado contact to 
require clarification, particularly with respect to the possibility of the continued development and 
characteristics of a dissolution front along this contact, and the impact that continued dissolution 
within the brine aquifer residuum would have on the overlying units of the Rustler.  The DOE 
discussed the rate and extent of dissolution processes further in supplemental information 
provided in a letter dated June 13, 1997 (Docket A-93-02, II-H-44).  Based upon this 
information, the EPA concluded that, while dissolution may occur along the Rustler/Salado 
contact, it would not affect the WIPP’s containment capabilities during the regulatory time 
period.  Further discussion of this topic is contained in EPA Technical Support Document for 
Section 194.14:  Content of Compliance Certification Application, Section IV.C.3 (Docket A-93-
02, Item V-B-3).

The WIPP site is in the Pecos River basin, which contains about 50 percent of the drainage area 
of the Rio Grande Water Resources Region.  The Pecos River headwaters are northeast of Santa 
Fe, and the river flows to the south through eastern New Mexico and western Texas to the Rio 
Grande.  The Pecos River has an overall length of about 805 km (500 mi), a maximum basin 
width of about 209 km (130 mi), and a drainage area of about 115,301 km2 (44,535 mi2). (About 
53,075 km2 [20,500 mi2] contained within the basin have no external surface drainage and their 
surface waters do not contribute to Pecos River flows.)  Figure 2-43 shows the Pecos River 
drainage area.

The Pecos River generally flows year-round, except in the reach below Anton Chico where the 
low flows percolate into the stream bed.  The main stem of the Pecos River and its major 
tributaries have low flows, and the tributary streams are frequently dry.  About 75 percent of the 
total annual precipitation and 60 percent of the annual flow result from intense local 
thunderstorms between April and September.

There are no perennial streams at the WIPP site.  At its nearest point, the Pecos River is about 19 
km (12 mi) southwest of the WIPP site boundary.  A few small creeks and draws are the only 
westward flowing tributaries of the Pecos River within 32 km (20 mi) north or south of the site.  
Nash Draw, the largest surface drainage feature east of the Pecos River in the WIPP region, is a 
closed depression and does not provide surface flow into the Pecos.  Potash mining operations in 
and near Nash Draw likely contribute to the flow in Nash Draw.  For example, the Mississippi 
Potash Inc. East operation located 11 to 13 km (7 to 8 mi) due north of the WIPP site disposes of 
mine tailings and refining-process effluent on its property and has done so since 1965.  Records 
obtained from the New Mexico Office of the State Engineer show that since 1973, an average of 
3 × 106 m3 (2,400 acre-feet [ac-ft]) of water per year has been pumped from local aquifers 
(Ogallala and Capitan) for use in the potash-refining process at that location (SNL 2003b).  
Based on knowledge of the potash refining process, approximately 90 percent of the pumped 
water is estimated to be discharged to the tailings pile.  Geohydrology Associates (1978) 
estimated that approximately half of the brine discharged onto potash tailings piles in Nash Draw 
seeps into the ground annually, while the remainder evaporates.  The Black River (drainage area:  
1,035 km2 [400 mi2]) joins the Pecos from the west about 25 km (16 mi) southwest of the site.  
The Delaware River (drainage area: 1,812 km2 [700 mi2]) and a number of small creeks and 
draws also join the Pecos River along this reach.  The flow in the Pecos River below Fort 
Sumner is regulated by storage in Sumner Lake, Brantley Reservoir, Lake Avalon, and several 
other smaller irrigation dams. 
26

Five major reservoirs are located on the Pecos River: Santa Rosa Lake, Sumner Lake, Brantley 
Reservoir, Lake Avalon, and the Red Bluff Reservoir, the last located just over the border in 
Texas (Figure 2-43).  The storage capacities of these reservoirs and the Two Rivers Reservoir in 
the Pecos River Basin are shown in Table 2-10.

With regard to surface drainage onto and off of the WIPP site, there are no major natural lakes or 
ponds within 8 km (5 mi) of the site.  Laguna Gatuña, Laguna Tonto, Laguna Plata, and Laguna 
Toston are playas more than 16 km (10 mi) north and are at elevations of 1,050 m (3,450 ft) or 
higher.  Thus, surface runoff from the site (elevation 1,010 m [3,310 ft] above sea level) would 
not flow toward any of them.  To the northwest, west, and southwest, Red Lake, Lindsey Lake, 
and Laguna Grande de la Sal are more than 8 km (5 mi) from the site, at elevations of 914 to 
1,006 m (3,000 to 3,300 ft).  A low-flow investigation has been initiated by the USGS within the 
Hill Tank Draw drainage area, the most prominent drainage feature near the WIPP site.  The 
drainage area is about 10.3 km2 (4 mi2), with an average channel slope of 1 to 100, and the 
drainage is westward into Nash Draw.  Two years of observations showed only four flow events.  
The USGS estimates that the flow rate for these events was under 0.057 m3/s (2 ft3/s) (DOE 
1980, pp. 7- 74). 
42

As discussed in Section 2.5.2.3, the mean annual precipitation in the region is 0.33 m (13 in.), 
and the mean annual runoff is 2.5 to 5 mm (0.1 to 0.2 in.).  The maximum recorded 24-hour

precipitation at Carlsbad was 130 mm (5.12 in.) in August 1916.  The predicted maximum 6-

during the summer.  The maximum recorded daily snowfall at Carlsbad was 254 mm (10 in.) in 
December 1923.

The maximum recorded flood on the Pecos River occurred near the town of Malaga, New 
Mexico, on August 23, 1966, with a discharge of 3,396 m3 (120,000 ft3) per second and a stage 
elevation of about 895 m (2,938 ft) amsl.  The minimum surface elevation at the WIPP is over 91 
m (300 ft) above the elevation of this maximum historic flood (DOE 1980, Section 7.4.1).

As discussed in the FEIS (DOE 1980, pp. 7- 71), more than 90 percent of the mean annual 
precipitation at the site is lost by evapotranspiration.  On a mean monthly basis, 
evapotranspiration at the site greatly exceeds the available rainfall; however, intense local 
thunderstorms may produce runoff and percolation.

Water quality in the Pecos River basin is affected by mineral pollution from natural sources and 
from irrigation return flows (see Section 2.4.2.2 for discussion of surface-water quality).  At 
Santa Rosa, New Mexico, the average suspended-sediment discharge of the river is about 1,497 
metric tons/day (1,650 tons/day).  Large amounts of chlorides from Salt Creek and Bitter Creek 
enter the river near Roswell.  River inflow in the Hagerman area contributes increased amounts 
of calcium, magnesium, and sulfate; and waters entering the river near Lake Arthur are high in 
chloride.  Below Brantley Reservoir, springs flowing into the river are usually submerged and 
difficult to sample; springs that could be sampled had TDS concentrations of 3,350 to 
4,000 mg/L.  Concentrated brine entering at Malaga Bend adds an estimated 64 metric tons/day 
(370 tons/day) of chloride to the Pecos River (CCA Appendix GCR, pp. 6-7).

At the outset of the repository program, the DOE understood the importance of resources in the 
vicinity of a disposal system.  Several of the siting criteria emphasized avoidance of resources 
that would impact the performance of the disposal system.  In this regard, the DOE selected a 
site that (1) maximized the use of federal lands, (2) avoided known oil and gas trends, (3) 
minimized the impacts on potash deposits, and (4) avoided existing drill holes.  While the DOE 
could not meet all these criteria totally, it is shown that the favorable characteristics of the 
location compensate for any increased risks due to the presence of resources.  Consequently, the 
DOE has prepared this section to discuss resources that may exist at or beneath the WIPP site.  
The topic of resources is used to broadly define both economic (mineral and nonmineral) and 
cultural resources associated with the WIPP site.  These resources are important because they 
(1) provide evidence of past uses of the area and (2) indicate potential future use of the area with 
the possibility that such use could lead to disruption of the closed repository.  Because of the 
depth of the disposal horizon, it is believed that only the mineral resources are of significance in 
predicting the long-term performance of the disposal system.  However, the nonmineral and 
cultural resources are presented for completeness because they are included in the FEP screening 
discussions in Chapter 6 and Appendix PA, Attachment SCR.  Information needed to make 
screening decisions includes natural resource distributions, including potable groundwaters, the 
distribution of drillholes, mines, excavations, and other man-made features that exploit these 
resources, the distribution of drillholes and excavation used for disposal or injection purposes, 
activities that significantly alter the land surface, agricultural activities that may affect the 
disposal system, archaeological resources requiring deep excavation to exploit, and technological 
changes that may alter local demographics.  This information is presented here or is referenced.

With respect to minerals or hydrocarbons, reserves are the portion of resources that are economic 
at today’s market prices and with existing technology.  For hydrocarbons, proved (proven) 
reserves are an estimated quantity that engineering and geologic data analysis demonstrates, with 
reasonable certainty, is recoverable in the future from discovered oil and gas pools.  Probable 
resources (extensions) consist of oil and gas in pools that have been discovered but not yet 
developed by drilling.  Their presence and distribution can generally be surmised with a high 
degree of confidence.  Probable resources (new pools) consist of oil and gas surmised to exist in 
undiscovered pools within existing fields.  (Definitions are from NMBMMR 1995, V-2 and 
V-3.)

Mineral resource discussions are focused principally on hydrocarbons and potassium salts, both 
of which have long histories of development in the region.  Development of either resource 
potentially could be disruptive to the disposal system.  The information regarding the mineral 
resources concentrates on the following factors: 
37 
38 
• number, location, depth, and present state of development, including penetrations through 
the disposal horizon, 
39 
• type of resource, 
40 
• accessibility, quality, and demand, and

The specific impacts of resource development are discussed in Section 6.4.6.2.3, where scenarios 
related to mineral development are included for evaluation of disposal system performance.  This 
discussion uses information presented in CCA Appendices DEL and MASS as indicated in the 
following text.  The discussion of cultural and economic resources is focused on describing past 
and present land uses unrelated to the development of minerals.  The archaeological record 
supports the observation that changes in land use are principally associated with climate and the 
availability of forage for wild and domestic animals.  In no case does it appear that past or 
present land use has had an impact on the subsurface beyond the development of shallow 
groundwater wells to water livestock.

The geologic studies of the WIPP site included the investigation of potential natural resources to 
evaluate the impact of denying access to these resources and other consequences of their 
occurrence.  Studies were completed in support of the FEIS to ensure knowledge of natural 
resources, and the impacts of denying access were included in the decision-making process for 
WIPP.  Of the natural resources expected to occur beneath the site, five are of practical concern:  
the two potassium salts sylvite and langbeinite, which occur in the McNutt; and the three 
hydrocarbons, crude oil, natural gas, and distillate liquids associated with natural gas, all three of 
which occur elsewhere in strata below the Castile.  Other mineral resources beneath the site are 
caliche, salt, gypsum, and lithium; enormous deposits of these minerals near the site and 
elsewhere in the country are more than adequate (and more economically attractive) to meet 
future requirements for these materials.  In 1995, the NMBMMR performed a reevaluation of the 
mineral resources at and within 1.6 km (1 mi) around the WIPP site.  The following discussion is 
based in part on information from NMBMMR (1995).

2.3.1.1 Potash Resources at the WIPP Site  
26 
27 
28 
29 
Throughout the Carlsbad Potash District, commercial quantities of potassium salts are restricted 
to the middle portion of the Salado, locally called the McNutt.  A total of 11 zones (or distinct 
ore layers) have been recognized in the McNutt.  Horizon Number 1 is at the base, and Number 
11 is at the top.  The 11th ore zone is not mined. 
30 
31 
32 
33 
34 
35 
The USGS uses three standard grades—low, lease, and high—to quantify the potash resources at 
the site.  The USGS assumes that the lease and high grades comprise reserves because some 
lease-grade ore is mined in the Carlsbad Potash District.  Most of the potash that is mined, 
however, is better typified as high-grade.  Even the high-grade resources may not be reserves, 
however, if properties such as high clay content make processing uneconomical.  The analysis in 
NMBMMR (1995) distinguishes between lease-grade ore and economically mineable ore.

The NMBMMR (1995) study contains a comprehensive summary of all previous potash resource 
evaluations.  NMBMMR (1995, Chapter VII) used 40 existing boreholes drilled on and around 
the WIPP site to perform a reevaluation of potash resources.  He selected holes that were drilled 
using brine so that the dissolution of potassium salts was inhibited.  The conclusion reached is

that only the 4th and 10th ore zones contain economic potash reserves.  The quantities are 
summarized in Table 2-11.

Within the Carlsbad Known Potash Leasing Area, exploration holes have been drilled to evaluate 
the grade of the various ore zones.  These are included in the drillhole database in CCA 
Appendix DEL.  None of the economically minable reserves identified by the NMBMMR lies 
directly above the waste panels.  The known potash leases within the Delaware Basin are shown 
in Figure 2-44 and are detailed in CCA Appendix DEL, Figure DEL-8.  From information in this 
figure and other data which is provided in CCA Appendix MASS, Attachment 15-5, DOE 
evaluates the extent of future mining outside the land withdrawal area.  The extent of possible 
future mining within the controlled area is shown in Figure 2-45.  The DOE also addresses this 
subject with respect to PA in Section 6.4.6.2.3.

The EPA concluded that neither the DOE’s nor the Department of Interior’s (DOI) estimate 
shows the area above the WIPP waste panels as containing mineable reserves. The DOE 
provided supplemental information in a letter dated May 14, 1997, indicating that potash solution 
mining and brine extraction do not need to be considered for the PA, based on low consequence 
to the containment capability of the repository (Docket A-93-02, Item II-I-31).  The EPA 
reviewed the supplemental data and concurred with the DOE’s conclusion.  To obtain further 
discussion on this topic, CARD 32-Section 32.B, CARD 33-Section 33A, and CARD 32-Section 
32 F (Docket A-93-02, item III-B-2) may be referenced.  Additional information is found in 
FEPs screening discussions for solution mining for potash and solution mining for other 
resources (FEPs H58 and H59) in Appendix PA, Attachment SCR.

2.3.1.2 Hydrocarbon Resources at the WIPP Site 
In 1974, Foster of the NMBMMR conducted a hydrocarbon resource study in southeastern New 
Mexico under contract to the ORNL.  The study included an area of 3,914 km2 (1,512 mi2).  At 
the time of that study, the proposed repository site was about 8 km (5 mi) northeast of the current 
site.  The 1974 NMBMMR evaluation included a more detailed study of a four-township area 
centered on the old site; the present site is in the southwest quadrant of that area.  The 1974 
NMBMMR hydrocarbon resources study (Foster 1974) is presented in more detail in the FEIS 
(DOE 1980, Section 9.2.3.5).  The reader is referred to the FEIS or the original study for 
additional information.

The resource evaluation was based both on the known reserves of crude oil and natural gas in the 
region and on the probability of discovering new reservoirs in areas where past unsuccessful 
drilling was either too widely spread or too shallow to have allowed discovery.  Potentially 
productive zones were considered in the evaluation; therefore, the findings may be used for 
estimating the total hydrocarbon resources at the site.  A fundamental assumption in the study 
was that the WIPP area has the same potential for containing hydrocarbons as the  
10 
11 
12 
larger region studied for which exploration data are available.  Whether such resources actually 
exist can be satisfactorily established only by drilling at spacings close enough to give a high 
probability of discovery.

previous evaluations.  NMBMMR (1995, Chapter XI) provided a reassessment of hydrocarbon

resources within the WIPP site boundary and within the first mile adjacent to the boundary.  
Calculations were made for resources that are extensions of known, currently productive oil and 
gas resources that are thought to extend beneath the study area with reasonable certainty (called 
probable resources in the report).  Qualitative estimates are also made concerning the likelihood 
that oil and gas may be present in undiscovered pools and fields in the area (referred to as 
possible resources).  Possible resources were not quantified in the study.  The results of the study 
are shown in Tables 2-12 and 2-13.

The DOE compiled statistics on the historical development of hydrocarbon resources in the 
Delaware Basin and included them in CCA Appendix DEL.  For these purposes, the Delaware 
Basin is described as the surface and subsurface features that lie inside the boundary formed to 
the north, east, and west by the innermost edge of the Capitan Reef and formed to the south by a 
straight line drawn from the southeastern point of the Davis Mountains to the southwestern point 
of the Glass Mountains (see Figure 2-46).

Several important modeling parameters result from the study of hydrocarbon resources and the 
history of their exploitation.  These include parameters related to the number of human 
intrusions, the size of boreholes, the operational histories of such holes, the plugging of these

holes, and the use of such holes for other purposes, such as liquid disposal.  Each of these topics 
is discussed in detail in CCA Appendix DEL and Appendix PA, Attachment MASS, Section 
MASS.16 and is addressed in Sections 6.4.7 and 6.4.12.  The distribution of existing boreholes is 
shown in Figure DEL-4 (CCA Appendix DEL) for the entire Delaware Basin and Figure 2-47 for 
the vicinity of the WIPP site.  In addition, CCA Appendix DEL includes an assessment of 
current drilling and plugging practices in the Delaware Basin.  CCA Appendix DEL also 
discusses the regulatory constraints placed on the use of wells for injection.

While the focus of studies at the WIPP has been on potash and hydrocarbon, other resources are 
known to occur within the Delaware Basin and are considered in the screening.  For example, 
sulfur is produced in the vicinity of Orla, Texas.  Sulfur wells are included in CCA Appendix 
DEL; however, no sulfur resources have been identified in the vicinity of the WIPP; therefore, 
there are no projected impacts.  Another resource that is extensively produced is groundwater.  
Potable water occurs in numerous places within the Delaware Basin.  Several communities rely 
solely on groundwater sources for drinking water. CCA Appendix DEL includes a distribution of 
groundwater wells in the Delaware Basin.  All such wells in the vicinity of the WIPP are 
shallow, generally no deeper than the Culebra.  An evaluation of underground sources of 
drinking water in the vicinity of the disposal system is presented in CCA Appendix USDW.  
Figure USDW-4 shows the distribution of groundwater wells in the vicinity of the disposal 
system.  Sand, gravel, and caliche are produced in numerous areas within the Delaware Basin.  In 
all cases, these are surface quarries that are generally shallow (10s of feet).  No impact to the 
disposal system is expected from these activities.

The WIPP facility is located 42 km (26 mi) east of Carlsbad in Eddy County in southeastern 
New Mexico and includes an area of 10,240 ac (approximately 41 km2) (16 mi2).  The facility is 
located in a sparsely populated area with fewer than 30 permanent residents living within a 16-
km (10-mi) radius of the facility.  The area surrounding the facility is used primarily for grazing, 
potash mining, and hydrocarbon production.  No resource development that would affect WIPP 
facility operations or the long-term integrity of the facility is allowed within the 10,240 ac that 
have been set aside for the WIPP project.

2 km (1.2 mi) to the south.  The community nearest to the WIPP site is the town of Loving, New 
Mexico, 29 km (18 mi) west-southwest of the site center.  The population of Loving increased 
from 1,243 in 1990 to 1,326 in 2000.  The nearest population center is the city of Carlsbad, New 
Mexico, 42 km (26 mi) west of the site.  The population of

The WIPP Land Withdrawal Act (LWA) (U.S. Congress 1992) withdrew certain public lands 
from the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM).  The law provides for the 
transfer of the WIPP site lands from the DOI to the DOE and effectively withdraws the lands, 
subject to existing rights, from entry, sale, or disposition; appropriation under mining laws; or 
operation of the mineral and geothermal leasing laws.  The LWA directed the Secretary of 
Energy to produce a management plan to provide for grazing, hunting and trapping, wildlife 
habitat, mining, and the disposal of salt and tailings.

Between 1978 and 1988, DOE acquired all active potash and hydrocarbon leases within the 
WIPP site boundary.  These were acquired either through outright purchase or through 
condemnation.  In one condemnation proceeding, the court awarded DOE the surface and top 
1.82 km (6,000 ft) of Section 31 and allowed the leaseholder to retain the subsurface below 1.82 
km (6,000 ft).  This was allowed because analysis showed that wells developed within this lease 
below the 1.82-km (6,000ft) limit would be too far away from the waste panels to be of 
consequence to the WIPP (see, for example, Brausch et al. 1982).  This is corroborated by the 
results of PA discussed in Section 6.2.5.1; and Appendix PA, Attachment SCR, FEP 56.  
Consequently, as the result of the DOE’s acquisition activities, there are no producing 
hydrocarbon wells within the volumetric boundary defined by the land withdrawal (T22S, R31E, 
S15-22, 27-34).  Two active wells were drilled to tap the oil and gas resources on the leases 
beneath Section 31.  The James Ranch #13, drilled in 1982, is a gas well, and the James Ranch 
#27, drilled in 2000, is an oil well.  Both wells are located on surface leases outside the WIPP 
site boundary.  Both wells enter Section 31 below a depth of 1.82 km (6,000 ft) beneath ground 
level.  Except for the leases in Section 31, the LWA prohibits all drilling into the controlled area 
unless such drilling is in support of the WIPP. 
27 
28 
29 
30 
Grazing leases have been issued for all land sections immediately surrounding the WIPP facility.  
Grazing within the WIPP site lands occurs within the authorization of the Taylor Grazing Act of 
1934, the Federal Land Policy and Management Act (FLPMA), the Public Rangelands 
Improvement Act of 1978, and the Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act of 1973.

The responsibilities of DOE include supervision of ancillary activities associated with grazing 
(for example, wildlife access to livestock water development), tracking of water developments 
inside WIPP lands to ensure that they are configured according to the regulatory requirements, 
and ongoing coordination with respective allottees.  Administration of grazing rights is in 
cooperation with the BLM according to the memorandum of understanding (MOU) and the 
coinciding Statement of Work through guidance established in the East Roswell Grazing 
Environmental Impact Statement.  The WIPP site is composed of two grazing allotments 
administered by the BLM:  the Livingston Ridge (No. 77027), and the Antelope Ridge 
(No. 77032) (see Figure 7-2).

2.3.2.3 History and Archaeology  
From about 10,000 B.C. to the late 1800s, the WIPP site and surrounding region were inhabited 
by nomadic aboriginal hunters and gatherers who subsisted on various wild plants and animals.  
From about A.D. 600 onward, as trade networks were established with Puebloan peoples to the 
west, domesticated plant foods and materials were acquired in exchange for dried meat, hides, 
and other products from the Pecos Valley and Plains.  In the late 1500s, the Spanish 
Conquistadors encountered Jumano and Apachean peoples in the region who practiced hunting 
and gathering and engaged in trade with Puebloans.  After the Jumanos abandoned the southern 
Plains region, the Comanches became the major population of the area.  Neighboring populations 
with whom the Comanches maintained relationships ranging from mutual trade to open warfare 
included the Lipan, or Southern Plains Apache, several Puebloan Groups, Spaniards, and the 
Mescalero Apaches.

The best documented indigenous culture in the WIPP region is that of the Mescalero Apaches, 
who lived west of the Pecos.  The lifestyle of the Mescalero Apaches represents a transition 
between the full sedentism of the Pueblos and the nomadic hunting and gathering of the 
Jumanos.  In 1763, the San Saba expedition encountered and camped with a group of Mescaleros 
in Los Medaños.  Expedition records indicate the presence of both Lipan and Mescalero Apaches 
in the region.

A peace accord reached between the Comanches and the Spaniards in 1786 resulted in two 
historically important economic developments:  (1) organized buffalo hunting by Hispanic and 
Puebloan ciboleros, and (2) renewal and expansion of the earlier extensive trade networks by 
Comancheros.  These events placed eastern New Mexico in a position to receive a wide array of 
both physical and ideological input from the Plains culture area to the east and north and from 
Spanish-dominated regions to the west and south.  Comanchero trade began to mesh with the 
Southwest American trade influence in the early nineteenth century.  However, by the late 1860s, 
the importance of Comanchero trade was cut short by Texan influence. 
27

30 
The first cattle trail in the area was established along the Pecos River in 1866 by Charles 
Goodnight and Oliver Loving.  By 1868, Texan John Chisum dominated much of the area by 
controlling key springs along the river.  Overgrazing, drought, and dropping beef prices led to 
the demise of open-range cattle ranching by the late 1880s. 
31 
32 
33 
34 
Following the demise of open-range livestock production, ranching developed using fenced 
grazing areas and production of hay crops for winter use.  Herd grazing patterns were influenced 
by the availability of water supplies as well as by the storage of summer grasses for winter 
feeding. 
35 
36 
37 
The town of Carlsbad was founded as Eddy in 1889 as a health spa.  In addition to ranching, the 
twentieth century brought the development of the potash, oil, and gas industries that have 
increased the population eightfold in the last 50 years. 
38 
39 
40 
Although technological change has altered some of the aspects, ranching remains an important 
economic activity in the WIPP region.  This relationship between people and the land is still an 
important issue in the area.  Ranch-related sites dating to the 1940s and 1950s are common in

The National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) (16 USC Part 470 et seq.) was enacted to protect 
the nation’s cultural resources in conjunction with the states, local governments, Indian tribes, 
and private organizations and individuals.  The policy of the federal government includes:  
(1) providing leadership in preserving the prehistoric and historic resources of the nation, 
(2) administering federally owned, administered, or controlled prehistoric resources for the 
benefit of present and future generations, (3) contributing to the preservation of nonfederally 
owned prehistoric and historic resources, and (4) assisting state and local governments and the 
national trust for historic preservation in expanding and accelerating their historic preservation 
programs and activities.  The act also established the National Register of Historic Places 
(National Register).  At the state level, the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) 
coordinates the state’s participation in implementing the NHPA.  The NHPA has been amended 
by two acts:  the Archeological and Historic Preservation Act (16 USC Part 469 et seq.), and the 
Archeological Resource Protection Act (16 USC Part 470aa et seq.).

To protect and preserve cultural resources found within the WIPP site boundary, the WIPP 
submitted a mitigation plan to the New Mexico SHPO describing the steps to either avoid or 
excavate archaeological sites.  A site was defined as a place used and occupied by prehistoric 
people.  In May 1980, the SHPO made a determination of “no adverse effect from WIPP facility 
activities” on cultural resources.  The Advisory Council on Historic Preservation concurred that 
the WIPP Mitigation Plan is appropriate to protect cultural resources.

Known historical sites (more than 50 years old) in southeastern New Mexico consist primarily of 
early twentieth century homesteads that failed, or isolated features from late nineteenth century 
and early twentieth century cattle or sheep ranching, or military activities.  To date, no Spanish 
or Mexican sites have been identified.  Historic components are rare but are occasionally noted 
in the WIPP area.  These include features and debris related to ranching.

Since 1976, cultural resource investigations have recorded 98 archaeological sites and numerous 
isolated artifacts within the 41km2 (16mi2) area enclosed by the WIPP site.  In the central 
10.4km2 (4mi2) area, 33 sites were determined to be eligible for inclusion on the National 
Register as archaeological districts.  Investigations since 1980 have recorded an additional 14 
individual sites outside the central 10.4km2 (4mi2) area that are considered eligible for inclusion 
on the National Register.  The following major cultural resource investigations to date are broken 
out in the list that follows.  Additional information can be found in the bibliography of CCA

1987.  Mariah Associates, Inc. identified 40 sites and 75 isolates in an inventory of 2,460 ac in 
15 quarter-section units surrounding the WIPP site.  In this investigation, 19 of the sites were 
located within the WIPP site’s boundary.  Sites encountered in this investigation tended to lack 
evident or intact features.  Of the 40 new sites defined, 14 were considered eligible for inclusion 
in the National Register, 24 were identified as having insufficient data to determine eligibility, 
and 2 were determined to be ineligible for inclusion.  The eligible and potentially eligible sites 
have been mapped and are avoided by DOE in its current activities at the WIPP site.

The Delaware Basin has been used in the past for an isolated nuclear test.  This test, Project 
Gnome, took place in 1961 at a location approximately 13 km (8 mi) southwest of the WIPP.  
The primary objective of Project Gnome was to study the effects of an underground nuclear 
explosion in salt.  The Gnome experiment involved the detonation of a 3.1-kiloton nuclear device 
at a depth of 361 m (1,200 ft) in the bedded salt of the Salado (Rawson et al. 1965).  The 
explosion created a cavity of approximately 28,000 m3 (1,000,000 ft3) and caused surface 
displacements over an area of about a 360m (1,200ft) radius.  Fracturing and faulting caused 
measurable changes in rock permeability and porosity at distances up to approximately 100 m 
(330 ft) from the cavity.  No earth tremors were reported at distances over 40 km (25 mi) from 
the explosion.  Project Gnome was decommissioned in 1979.

Background environmental conditions at and near the WIPP site were characterized prior to the 
initiation of the operation of the facility and are described in CCA Section 2.4.  Because 
background characterization focuses on environmental conditions existing prior to operations, it 
is not meaningful to redefine background environmental conditions after operations began.  
Accordingly, information presented in CCA Section 2.4 is not repeated and updated in this 
recertification application.

The DOE did not consider climate directly in its site selection process, although criteria such as 
low population density and large tracts of federally owned land tend to favor arid and semi-arid 
areas in the western United States.  The semi-arid climate around the WIPP is beneficial since it 
is a direct cause of the lack of a near surface water table and the minimization of radiation 
exposure pathways that involve surface or groundwater.  Data used to interpret paleoclimates in 
the American southwest come from a variety of sources and indicate alternating arid and subarid 
to subhumid climates throughout the Pleistocene.  The information in this section was taken from 
Swift (1992), and included in CCA Appendix CLI and references therein.

Prior to 18,000 years ago, radiometric dates are relatively scarce, and the record is incomplete.  
From 18,000 years ago to the present, however, the climatic record is relatively well constrained 
by floral, faunal, and lacustrine data.  These data span the transition from the last full-glacial 
maximum to the present interglacial period; given the global consistency of glacial fluctuations 
described below, they can be taken to be broadly representative of extremes for the entire 
Pleistocene.

Early and middle Pleistocene paleoclimatic data for the southwestern United States are 
incomplete and permit neither continuous reconstructions of paleoclimates nor direct correlations 
between climate and glaciation prior to the last glacial maximum, which occurred 22,000 to 
18,000 years ago.  Stratigraphic and soil data from several locations, however, indicate that 
cyclical alternation of wetter and drier climates in the Southwest had begun by the Early 
Pleistocene.  Fluvial gravels in the Gatuña exposed in the Pecos River Valley of eastern New 
Mexico suggest wetter conditions 1.4 million years ago and again 600,000 years ago.  The 
Mescalero caliche, exposed locally over much of southeastern New Mexico, suggests drier 
conditions 510,000 years ago, and loosely dated spring deposits in Nash Draw west of the WIPP 
imply wetter conditions occurring again later in the Pleistocene.  The Blackwater Draw 
Formation of the southern High Plains of eastern New Mexico and western Texas, correlating in 
time to both the Gatuña Formation and the Mescalero caliche, contains alternating soil and eolian 
sand horizons that show at least six climatic cycles beginning more than 1.4 million years ago 
and continuing to the present.

Data used to construct the more detailed climatic record for the latest Pleistocene and Holocene 
come from six independent lines of evidence dated using carbon-14 techniques:  plant 
communities preserved in packrat middens throughout the southwest, including sites in Eddy and 
Otero counties, New Mexico; pollen assemblages from lacustrine deposits in western New 
Mexico and other locations in the southwest; gastropod assemblages from western Texas; 
ostracod assemblages from western New Mexico; paleolake levels throughout the southwest; and 
faunal remains from caves in southern New Mexico.

Prior to the last glacial maximum 22,000 to 18,000 years ago, evidence from faunal assemblages 
in caves in southern New Mexico, including the presence of species such as the desert tortoise 
that are now restricted to warmer climates, suggests hot summers and mild, dry winters.  
Lacustrine evidence confirms the interpretation of a relatively dry climate prior to and during the 
glacial advance.  Permanent water did not appear in what was later to become a major lake in the 
Estancia Valley in central New Mexico until some time before 24,000 years ago, and water 
depths in lakes at higher elevations in the San Agustin Plains in western New Mexico did not 
reach a maximum until sometime between 22,000 and 19,000 years ago.  Ample floral and 
lacustrine evidence documents cooler, wetter conditions in the southwest during the glacial peak.  
These changes were not caused by the immediate proximity of glacial ice.  None of the 
Pleistocene continental glaciations advanced farther southwest than northeastern Kansas, and the 
most recent, late-Wisconsinan ice sheet reached its limit in South Dakota, approximately 1,200 
km (750 mi) from WIPP.  Discontinuous alpine glaciers formed at the highest elevations 
throughout the Rocky Mountains, but these isolated ice masses were symptoms, rather than 
causes, of cooler and wetter conditions and had little influence on regional climate at lower 
elevations.  The closest such glacier to WIPP was on the northeast face of Sierra Blanca Peak in 
the Sacramento Mountains, approximately 220 km (135 mi) to the northwest.

Global climate models indicate that the dominant glacial effect in the southwest was the 
disruption and southward displacement of the westerly jet stream by the physical mass of the ice 
sheet to the north.  At the glacial peak, major Pacific storm systems followed the jet stream 
across New Mexico and the southern Rocky Mountains, and winters were wetter and longer than 
either at the present or during the previous interglacial period.

Gastropod assemblages at Lubbock Lake in western Texas suggest mean annual temperatures 5º 
C (9º F) below present values.  Both floral and faunal evidence indicate that annual precipitation 
throughout the region was 1.6 to 2.0 times greater than today’s values.  Floral evidence also 
suggests that winters may have continued to be relatively mild, perhaps because the glacial mass 
blocked the southward movement of arctic air.  Summers at the glacial maximum were cooler 
and drier than at present, without a strongly developed monsoon.

The jet stream shifted northward following the gradual retreat of the ice sheet after 18,000 years 
ago, and the climate responded accordingly.  By approximately 11,000 years ago, conditions 
were significantly warmer and drier than previously, although still dominated by winter storms 
and still wetter than today.  Major decreases in total precipitation and the shift toward the 
modern monsoonal climate did not occur until the ice sheet had retreated into northeastern 
Canada in the early Holocene.

By middle Holocene time, the climate was similar to that of the present, with hot, monsoon-
dominated summers and cold, dry winters.  The pattern has persisted to the present, but not 
without significant local variations.  Soil studies show that the southern High Plains were drier 
from 6,500 to 4,500 years ago than before or since.  Gastropod data from Lubbock Lake indicate 
the driest conditions from 7,000 to 5,000 years ago (precipitation, 0.89 times present values; 
mean annual temperature, 2.5º C [4.5º F] higher than present values), with a cooler and wetter 
period 1,000 years ago (precipitation, 1.45 times present values; mean annual temperature, 2.5º C 
[4.5º F] lower than present).  Plant assemblages from southwestern Arizona suggest steadily 
decreasing precipitation from the middle Holocene to the present, except for a brief wet period 
approximately 990 years ago.  Stratigraphic work at Lake Cochise (the present Willcox playa in 
southeast Arizona) shows two mid-Holocene lake stands, one near or before 5,400 years ago and 
one between or before 3,000 to 4,000 years ago; however, both were relatively short-lived, and 
neither reached the maximum depths of the Late Pleistocene high stand that existed before 
14,000 years ago.

Inferred historical precipitation indicates that during the Holocene, wet periods were relatively 
drier and shorter in duration than those of the late Pleistocene.  Historical records over the last 
several hundred years indicate numerous lower-intensity climatic fluctuations, some too short in 
duration to affect floral and faunal circulation.  Sunspot cycles and the related change in the 
amount of energy emitted by the sun have been linked to historical climatic changes elsewhere in 
the world, but the validity of the correlation is uncertain.  Correlations have also been proposed 
between volcanic activity and climatic change.  In general, however, causes for past short-term 
changes are unknown.

The climatic record presented here should be interpreted with caution because its resolution and 
accuracy are limited by the nature of the data used to construct it.  Floral and faunal assemblages 
change gradually and show only a limited response to climatic fluctuations that occur at 
frequencies that are higher than the typical life span of the organisms in question.  For long-lived 
species such as trees, resolution may be limited to hundreds or even thousands of years.  
Sedimentation in lakes and playas has the potential to record higher-frequency fluctuations, 
including single-storm events, but only under a limited range of circumstances.  Once water 
levels reach a spill point, for example, lakes show only a limited response to further increases in 
precipitation.

With these observations in mind, three significant conclusions can be drawn from the climatic 
record of the American southwest.  First, maximum precipitation in the past coincided with the 
maximum advance of the North American ice sheet.  Minimum precipitation occurred after the 
ice sheet had retreated to its present limits.  Second, past maximum long-term average 
precipitation levels were roughly twice the present levels.  Minimum levels may have been 
90 percent of the present levels.  Third, short-term fluctuations in precipitation have occurred 
during the present relatively dry, interglacial period, but they have not exceeded the upper limits 
of the glacial maximum.

14 
Too little is known about the relatively short-term behavior of global circulation patterns to 
accurately predict precipitation levels over the next 10,000 years.  The long-term stability of 
patterns of glaciation and deglaciation, however, do permit the conclusion that future climatic 
extremes are unlikely to exceed those of the late Pleistocene.  Furthermore, the periodicity of 
glacial events suggests that a return to full-glacial conditions is highly unlikely within the next 
10,000 years.

Recent climatic conditions are provided to allow for the assessment of impacts of these factors 
on the disposal unit and the site.  Data are taken from the WIPP environmental monitoring 
reports (see WEC 1991a, 1991b, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998; WGESC 1999;

The climate of the region is semiarid, with generally mild temperatures, low precipitation and 
humidity, and a high evaporation rate.  Winds are mostly from the southeast and moderate.  In 
late winter and spring, there are strong west winds and dust storms.  During the winter, the 
weather is often dominated by a high-pressure system situated in the central portion of the 
western United States and a low-pressure system located in north-central Mexico.  During the 
summer, the region is affected by a low-pressure system normally situated over Arizona.

Temperatures are moderate throughout the year, although seasonal changes are distinct.  The 
mean annual temperature in southeastern New Mexico is 63º F (17º C).  In the winter (December 
through February), nighttime lows average near 23º F (-5º C), and maxima average in the 50s.  
The lowest recorded temperature at the nearest Class-A weather station in Roswell was -29º F     
(-34º C) in February 1905.  In the summer (June through August), the daytime temperature 
exceeds 90EF (32º C) approximately 75 percent of the time.  The National Weather Service 
documented 122º F (50º C) at the WIPP site as the record high temperature for New Mexico.  
This temperature was recorded on June 27, 1994.  Table 2-14 shows the annual average, 
maximum, and minimum temperatures from 1990 through 2002.

Precipitation is light and unevenly distributed throughout the year, averaging 28.2cm (11.1in.) 
per year from 1995 through 2002.  Winter is the season of least precipitation, averaging less than 
1.5 cm (0.6 in.) of rainfall per month.  Snow averages about 13 cm (5 in.) per year at the site and 
seldom remains on the ground for more than a day. Approximately half the annual precipitation 
comes from frequent thunderstorms in June through September.  Rains are usually brief but 
occasionally intense when moisture from the Gulf of Mexico spreads over the region.  Monthly 
average, maximum, and minimum precipitations recorded at the WIPP site from 1990 through

The DOE used tectonic activity as a siting criterion.  The intent was to avoid tectonic conditions 
such as faulting and igneous activity that would jeopardize waste isolation over the long term 
and to avoid areas where earthquake size and frequency could impact facility design and 
operations.  The WIPP site met both aspects of this criterion fully.  Long-term tectonic activity is 
discussed in Section 2.1.5.  The favorable results of the seismic (earthquake) studies are 
discussed here.  The purpose of the seismic studies is to build a basis from which to predict 
ground motions that the WIPP repository may be subjected to in the near and distant future.  The 
concern about seismic effects in the near future, during the operational period, pertains mainly to 
the design requirements for surface and underground structures for providing containment during 
seismic events.  The concern about effects occurring over the long term, after the repository has 
been decommissioned and sealed, pertains more to relative motions (faulting) within the 
repository and possible effects of faulting on the integrity of the salt beds and/or shaft seals.  
Updated seismic activity information is provided in Figures 2-57 and 2-58.  In this discussion,

Seismic data are presented in two time frames, before and after the time when seismographic 
data for the region became available.  The earthquake record in southern New Mexico dates back 
only to 1923, and seismic instruments have been in place in the state since 1961.  Various 
records have been examined to determine the seismic history of the area within 180 mi (288 km) 
of the site.  With the exception of a weak shock in 1926 at Hope, New Mexico (approximately 64 
km [40 mi] northwest of Carlsbad), and shocks in 1936 and 1949 felt at Carlsbad, all known 
shocks in the region before 1961 occurred to the west and southwest of the site more than 
160 km (100 mi) away.

The strongest earthquake on record occurring within 288 km (180 mi) of the site was the 
Valentine, Texas earthquake of August 16, 1931.  It has been estimated to have been of 
magnitude 6.4 on the Richter scale (Modified Mercalli Intensity of VIII).  The Valentine 
earthquake was 208 km (130 mi) south-southwest of the site.  Its Modified Mercalli Intensity at 
the site is estimated to have been V; this is believed to be the highest intensity felt at the site in 
this century.

In 1887, a major earthquake occurred in northeast Sonora, Mexico.  Although about 536 km 
(335 mi) west-southwest of the site, it is indicative of the size of earthquakes possible in the 
eastern portion of the Basin and Range Province, west of the province containing the site.  Its 
magnitude was estimated to have been 7.8 (VIII to IX in Modified Mercalli Intensity).  It was 
felt over an area of 1.3 million km2 (0.5 million mi2) (as far as Santa Fe to the north and Mexico 
City to the south); fault displacements near the epicenter were as large as 18 m (26 ft).

Since 1961, instrumental coverage has become comprehensive enough to locate most of the 
moderately strong earthquakes (local magnitude >3.5) in the region.  Instrumentally determined 
shocks that occurred within 288 km (180 mi) of the site between 1961 and 1994 are shown in 
Figure 2-57.  The distribution of these earthquakes may be biased by the fact that seismic 
stations were more numerous and were in operation for longer periods north and west of the site.  
Pre-1961 earthquakes can be found in CCA Appendix GCR, Figure 5.2-1.

Except for the activity southeast of the site, the distribution of epicenters since 1961 differs little 
from that of shocks before that time.  There are two clusters, one associated with the Rio Grande 
Rift on the Texas-Chihuahua border and another associated with the Central Basin Platform in 
Texas near the southeastern corner of New Mexico.  The latter activity was not reported before 
1964.  It is not clear from the record whether earthquakes were occurring in the Central Basin 
Platform before 1964, although local historical societies and newspapers tend to confirm their 
absence before that time.

The April 14, 1995, earthquake near Marathon, Texas, was located 240 km (150 mi) south of the 
WIPP site.  The USGS estimated that moment magnitude for this event was 5.7.  At a distance of

240 km (149 mi), an event of magnitude 5.7 would produce a maximum acceleration at the 
WIPP site of less than 0.01 g (acceleration due to gravity).

The Marathon earthquake should not be considered an unanticipated event.  The shock occurred 
in the Basin and Range Province, a seismotectonic province with evidence for 24 Quarternary 
faults in West Texas and adjacent parts of Mexico.  Two of these faults had recent surface-
faulting events in the Holocene.  Strong earthquakes have occurred within the West Texas part of 
the Basin and Range Province, most notably the MW = 6.4 (Richter) Valentine, Texas earthquake 
on August 15, 1931. 
The WIPP site is located within the Great Plains seismotectonic province, a region that has no 
evidence of Quarternary faulting, even above major buried structures such as the Central Basin 
Platform.  Because the Great Plains seismotectonic province is geologically distinct from the 
Basin and Range Province and lacks evidence for recent faulting, the maximum possible or

Procedures exist that allow for formal determination of earthquake probabilistic design 
parameters.  In typical seismic risk analyses of this kind, the region of study is divided into 
seismic source areas within which future events are considered equally likely to occur at any 
location.  For each seismic source area, the rate of occurrence of events above a chosen threshold 
level is estimated using the observed frequency of historical events.  The sizes of successive 
events in each source are assumed to be independent and exponentially distributed; the slope of 
the log number versus frequency relationship is estimated from the relative frequency of 
different sizes of events observed in the historical data.  This slope, often termed the b value, is 
determined either for each seismic source individually or for all sources in the region jointly.  
Finally, the maximum possible size of events for each source is determined using judgement and 
the historical record.  Thus, all assumptions underlying a measure of earthquake risk derived 
from this type of analysis are explicit, and a wide range of assumptions may be employed in the 
analysis procedure.

In this section, the particular earthquake risk parameter calculated is peak acceleration expressed 
as a function of annual probability of being exceeded at the WIPP site.  The particular analysis 
procedure applied to the calculation of this probabilistic peak acceleration is taken from a 
computer program written by McGuire (1976).  In that program, the seismic source zones are 
modeled geometrically as quadrilaterals of arbitrary shape.  Contributions to site earthquake risk 
from individual source zones are integrated into the probability distribution of acceleration, and 
the average annual probability of exceedence then follows directly. 
24 
25 
26 
27 
28 
29 
In the analysis, the principal input parameters are as follows:  site region acceleration 
attenuation, source zone geometry, recurrence statistics, and maximum magnitudes.  Based on 
these parameters, several curves showing probabilistic peak acceleration are developed, and the 
conclusions that may be drawn from these curves are considered.  The data treated in this way 
are used to arrive at a general statement of risk from vibratory ground motion at the site during 
its active phase of development and use. 
30 
2.6.2.1 Acceleration Attenuation  
31 
32 
33 
The first input parameters considered have to do with acceleration attenuation in the site region 
as a function of earthquake magnitude and hypocentral distance.  The risk analysis used in this 
study employs an attenuation law of the form 
34 
 
a = b1 exp(b2ML)R-b3 , 
(2.3) 
where a is acceleration in cm/s2, ML is Richter local magnitude, and R is the distance in km.  The 
particular formula used in this study is based on a central United States model developed by 
Nuttli (1973).  The formula coefficients b1 = 17, b2 = 0.92, and b3 = 1.0 were selected.  A 
justification for this assumption can be found in CCA Appendix GCR, Section 5.3.2.

Geologic, tectonic, and seismic evidence indicates that three seismic source zones may be used 
to adequately characterize the region.  These are well approximated by the Basin and Range 
subregion, the Permian Basin subregion exclusive of the Central Basin Platform, and the Central 
Basin Platform itself.  Specific boundaries are taken from a 1976 study by Algermissen and 
Perkins (1976) of earthquake risks throughout the United States.  Additional details on this study 
are in CCA Appendix GCR, Section 5.3.2.

Site region seismic source zones are shown in Figure 2-58.  Superposed on these zones are the 
earthquake epicenters of Figure 2-57.  The zonation presented generally conforms with historical 
seismicity.  The source zonation of Figure 2-58 has no explicit analog to the Permian Basin 
subregion exclusive of the Central Basin Platform.  This is considered part of the broad 
background region.

For the purposes of this study, some minor modifications of the Algermissen and Perkins (1976) 
source zones were made.  Geologic and tectonic evidence suggests that the physiographic 
boundary between the Basin and Range and Great Plains provinces provides a good and 
conservative approximation of the source zones (CCA Appendix GCR).  In addition, information 
from the Kermit seismic array (Appendix to Rogers and Malkiel 1979) indicates that the 
geometry used to model the limits of the Central Basin Platform source zone may be modified 
somewhat from the original analogous Algermissen and Perkins (1976) zone.  These 
modifications are shown in Figure 2-59 and constitute the preferred model for the WIPP site 
region seismic source zones in this study.  This model is preferred because it more completely 
considers geologic and tectonic information, as well as seismic data, and because it results in a 
more realistic development of risks at the WIPP facility.

With regard to earthquake focal depth, there is little doubt that the focal depths of earthquakes in 
the WIPP facility region should be considered shallow.  Early instrumental locations were 
achieved using an arc intersection method employing travel-time-distance curves calculated from 
a given crustal model, and the assumption of focal depths of 5 km (3.1 mi), 10 km (6.2 mi), or, 
for later calculations, 8 km (5 mi).  Good epicentral locations could generally be obtained under 
these assumptions.  For conservatism, a focal depth of 5 km (3.1 mi) is used in all source zones 
of this study including that of the site.  For smaller hypocentral distances, the form of the 
attenuation law adopted here severely exaggerates the importance of small, close shocks in the 
estimation of probabilistic acceleration at the WIPP site.  Additional discussion is included CCA 
Appendix GCR, Chapter 5. 
34 
2.6.2.3 Source Zone Recurrence Formulas and Maximum Magnitudes

The risk calculation procedure used in this study requires that earthquake recurrence rates for 
each seismic source zone be specified.  This is done formally by computing the constants a and b 
in the equation

For the WIPP facility region, three formulas of this type are needed:  one for the province west 
and southwest of the site (the Basin and Range subregion or Rio Grande Rift source zone), 
another for the province of the WIPP facility exclusive of the Central Basin Platform (the 
Permian Basin subregion or background source zone), and a final one for the Central Basin 
Platform.  In practice, the difficulties in finding meaningful recurrence formulas for such small 
areas in a region of low historical earthquake activity are formidable.

The term Design Basis Earthquake (DBE) is used for the design of surface confinement 
structures and components at the WIPP facility.  As used here, the DBE is equivalent to the 
design earthquake used in Regulatory Guide 3.24 (Nuclear Regulatory Commission [NRC] 
1974).  That is, in view of the limited consequences of seismic events in excess of those used as 
the basis, the DBE is such that it produces ground motion at the WIPP facility with a recurrence 
interval of 1,000 years.  In practice, the DBE is defined in terms of the 1,000-year acceleration 
and design response spectra. 
15 
16

The generation of curves expressing probability of occurrence or risk as a function of peak WIPP 
facility ground acceleration is discussed in detail in CCA Appendix GCR, Section 5.3, for a 
number of possible characterizations of WIPP facility region source zones and source zone 
earthquake parameters.  The most conservative (and the least conservative) risk curves are shown 
in Figure 2-60.

From this figure, the most conservative calculated estimate of the 1,000-year acceleration at the 
WIPP facility is approximately 0.075 g.  The geologic and seismic assumptions leading to this 
1,000-year peak acceleration include the consideration of a Richter magnitude 5.5 earthquake at 
the site, a 6.0 magnitude earthquake on the Central Basin Platform, and a 7.8 magnitude 
earthquake in the Basin and Range subregion.  These values, especially the first two, are 
considered quite conservative, as are the other parameters used in the 0.075g derivation.  For 
additional conservatism, a peak design acceleration of 0.1 g is selected for the WIPP facility 
DBE.  The design response spectra for vertical and horizontal motions are taken from Regulatory 
Guide 1.60 (NRC 1973) with the high-frequency asymptote scaled to this 0.1g peak acceleration 
value. 
30 
31 
32 
33 
34 
This DBE and the risk analysis that serves an important role in its definition are directly 
applicable to surface confinement structures and components at the WIPP facility.  Underground 
structures and components are not subject to DBE design requirements because according to 
Pratt et al. (1979), mine experience and studies on earthquake damage to underground facilities 
show that tunnels are not damaged at sites having peak surface accelerations below 0.2 g.
