Contract Declaration and Execution
TERMS AND CONDITIONS
Incorporation
The Request for Proposal and/or bid documents for this project and the vendor's proposal in response to the RFP or Bid together with any
clarifications, attachments, appendices, or amendments of the State or the Vendor are incorporated into this Contract by reference as if fully
set forth in this Contract.
Remedies upon Default
In any case where the vendor has failed to deliver or has delivered non-conforming goods and/or services, the State shall provide a cure
notice.  The notice to cure shall state the maximum length of time the vendor has to cure.  If after the time period stated in the notice to cure
has passed, the vendor continues to be in default, the State may procure goods and/or services in substitution from another source and
charge the difference between the contracted price and the market price to the defaulting vendor.  The State's Attorney General shall be
requested to make collection from the defaulting vendor.
Force Majeure
Force majeure includes acts of God, war, civil disturbance and any other causes which are beyond the control and anticipation of the party
affected and which, by the exercise of reasonable diligence, the party was unable to anticipate or prevent.  These provisions of force
majeure also apply to subcontractors or suppliers of the Vendor.  Force majeure does not include financial difficulties of the Vendor or any
associated company of the Vendor, or claims or court orders that restrict the Vendor's ability to deliver the goods or services contemplated
by this Agreement.  Neither the Vendor nor the State shall be liable to the other for any delay or failure of performance of this Agreement
caused by a force majeure, and not as a result of the fault or negligence of a party.
Subcontractors
The successful vendor shall be responsible for all acts and performance of any subcontractor or secondary supplier that the successful
vendor may engage for the completion of any contract with the State.  A delay that results from a subcontractor's conduct, negligence or
failure to perform shall not exempt the vendor from default remedies.  The successful vendor shall be responsible for payment to all
subcontractors and all other third parties.
Termination-Non-Appropriation
Notwithstanding any other provision of this contract, if funds anticipated for the continued fulfillment of this contract are at any time not
forthcoming or insufficient, either through the failure of the State to appropriate funds, discontinuance or material alteration of the program for
which funds were provided, then the State shall have the right to terminate this contract without penalty by giving not less than thirty (30)
days written notice documenting the lack of funding, discontinuance or program alteration.
Immunity of State/Fed Agencies
The vendor shall defend and hold harmless the State and Federal funding source for the State of Iowa from liability arising from the vendor's
performance of this contract and the vendor's activities with subcontracted and all other third parties.

A.  Deliveries - All deliveries are to be made only to the point specified on the purchase order.  If delivery is made to any other point, it shall

C.  Notice of Rejection - The nature of any rejections of a shipment, based on apparent deficiencies disclosed by ordinary methods of
inspection, will be given by the receiving agency to the vendor and carrier within a reasonable time after delivery of the item, with a copy of

purpose intended may be given by the State of Iowa at any time after acceptance.
Delivery and Acceptance (cont)
D.  Disposition of Rejected item - The vendor must remove at the vendor's expense any item rejected by the State.  If the vendor fails to
remove that rejected item, the State may dispose of the item by offering the same for sale, deduct any accrued expense and remit the
balance to the vendor.
E.  Testing After Delivery - Laboratory analysis of an item or other means of testing may be required after delivery.  In such cases, vendors
