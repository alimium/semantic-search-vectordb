CORTES W. RANDELL AND JOHN B. MUMFORD INDICTED 
The Washington 
Regional 
Office 
announced 
that on October 
5 a federal 
grand 
jury
sitting 
in Alexandria, 
Virginia 
entered 
a 17 count 
indictment 
against 
Cortes 
W. 
Randell, 
of McLean, 
Virginia, 
and John B. Mumford, 
of Fairfax, 
Virginia. 
The indict-
ment charges 
Randell 
and Mumford 
with 
seven counts 
of mail 
fraud, 
five counts 
of 
securities 
fraud, 
four counts 
of interstate 
transportation 
of money 
taken by fraud 
and one count of making 
a false statement 
to a federal 
agency. 
The indictment 
involves 
the 1974 and 1975 activities 
of National 
Commercial 
Credit 
Corporation 
and Federal 
Mortgage 
Acceptance 
Corporation, 
both Virginia 
corporations.
The indictment 
charges 
that both Randell 
and Mumford 
had control 
of both corporations
as consultants, 
directors, 
officers 
and controlling 
stockholders. 
d
= 
The indictment 
charges that Randell and Mumford devised a scheme and artifice to 
defraud 
and to obtain money from individual 
investors, 
Maryland 
National 
Industrial 
Finance 
Corporation, 
Farmers Bank of the State of Delaware, 
Metropolitan 
Mortgage
Fund, Inc., and the Veterans Administration 
by making 
false and fraudulent 
representa-
tions and by omissions 
of material 
facts. 
The indictment 
states that the money and 
property obtained by Randell was diverted 
to his own personal use and benefit unrelated 
to the business 
activities 
of Federal Mortgage Acceptance 
Corporation. 
A further 
omission 
alleged that Randall was previously 
indicted and pled guilty on or about 
August 
16, 1974, to four counts of securities 
fraud in connection 
with National 
Student 
Marketing 
Corporation 
and served a prison sentence. 
On September 
22, in connection 
with this case, Harry Koenigsberg, 
chairman of the 
board of directors 
of National Commercial 
Credit Corporation 
in 1974 and 1975, pled 
guilty to one count of securities 
fraud in the sale of NCCC securities.
