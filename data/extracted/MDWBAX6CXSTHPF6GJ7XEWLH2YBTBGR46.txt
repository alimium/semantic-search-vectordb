This Train-the-Trainer Program was designed to orient community activists and leaders on the 
basics of workplace health and safety:  
(1) Identifying hazards at the workplace, 
(2) Understanding how such hazards can impact workers’ health,  
(3) Basics on workers’ legal rights to a safe and healthy workplace, and  
(4) Tools for workers to develop their own solutions in the workplace.   
 
The training was developed based in the experiences of the membership of Make the Road 
New York – for low-wage Latino immigrant workers, many of whom are undocumented.  They 
work in businesses including restaurants, delis and groceries, small factories, non-union 
construction, retail, home health care, domestic work, among others.  Many work in very small 
businesses – often with 10 or fewer employees.  Few enjoy the protections afforded by a union 
in their job. 
 
For many, unsafe working conditions are a routine reality on the job – as is the real risk of 
retaliation, if workers speak out to the boss.  Likewise, for many supporting families here and in 
their home country, an unsafe job may seem better than the risk of no job at all. 
 
It is in this context that we hope to arm community leaders with a realistic, relevant orientation 
around health and safety issues.  There is an emphasis in this training on group work and group 
problem solving – and a goal to identify those steps workers can take together to improve their 
working conditions, with or without the knowledge or support of the boss.  It is important for 
workers to understand that the law protects them against retaliation for complaining about 
unsafe conditions, regardless of immigration status.  However, workers should also understand 
that if they are fired in retaliation, it may be difficult to win their job back if they lack status.  
Likewise, workers should also understand that the law affords fairly narrow protections for 
refusing to perform work that is unsafe. 
 
Where unsafe working conditions exist, the goal is to help workers connect to resources such as 
community organizations like Make the Road – so workers can get the support and back-up to 
take action, including reporting conditions to government agencies such as OSHA, the federal 
Occupational Safety and Health Administration.   
 
This program is designed for workers with varying levels of formal education and literacy in 
their native language.  Group participatory activities, pictures, and other formats ensure that all 
workers can actively and equally participate in the exercises.

Finally, this training covers the most fundamental rights of workers under the federal OSH Act, 
and is intended for workers who work primarily in what OSHA classifies as “miscellaneous.”  
OSHA issues very detailed regulations for many specific jobs, and many specific hazards, that 
are beyond the scope of this training.  For more detailed information to supplement these 
exercises, trainers are encouraged to read the Introduction to OSHA Instructor Guide 
published by OSHA on its website.1  The OSHA website has many useful resources for workers 
as well.2   
 
About Make the Road New York: 
Make the Road New York is a community-based nonprofit organization with centers in 
Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island, and Suffolk County Long Island, New York.  Make the Road 
New York builds the power of Latino and working class communities to achieve dignity and 
justice through organizing, policy innovation, transformative education, and survival services.  
The organization’s nearly 9,000 members – primarily low-income Latino immigrants – tackle the 
key issues facing their communities, including workplace justice, tenants’ rights, civil rights, 
public education, health care access, adult literacy, and workforce development.  For more than 
14 years, Make the Road has focused in particular on helping low-wage immigrant workers 
enforce their most basic rights on the job – from receiving the minimum wage and overtime to 
ensuring a healthy and safe work environment.  This training is designed to help organizations 
across the country work with community leaders and activists, to learn about workers’ rights to 
a safe work environment and strategies to protecting their own safety and health.   
 
Acknowledgments: 
Make the Road New drew from many wonderful resources to create this training.  In particular,

T R A I N E R  T I P S  &  P R E P A R A T I O N  
 
Before you hold the training, think through the following in preparation: 
 
�
��
� Work Space 
Know the space in which you will hold the training.  It is best to have the group 
sit in a circle for large group activities.  For small group work, make sure there is 
sufficient space for people to spread out.   
 
 
�
��
� Managing Questions: 
 
Post a large sheet of butcher paper at the start of the day, labeled “Questions” 
or “Preguntas” (in Spanish).  Encourage participants to ask questions as you 
proceed.  If a question is not related to the immediate topic, or if you do not 
know the answer yourself, have them write the question up on the sheet (or 
write it for them, if they do not feel comfortable writing).  At the end of the 
training, run through the list and see how many questions are not yet answered.  
Prepare to return with an answer yourself, or assign research to participants.  
 
�
��
� Group Dynamic 
Establish a practice to encourage “Step Up/Step Back.”  Participants who speak 
often should be encouraged to “step back” so others may contribute.  
Participants who are shy about offering ideas should be encouraged to “step 
up.”  In group discussions, wait to call on someone a second time until all others 
have had a chance to speak.  Also consider gender balance – ensure that all 
participate equally in group discussions. 
 
�
��
� Ground Rules 
Have the group establish ground rules that you write up at the front of the room.  
Good rules include shutting off cell phones, respect for everyone’s ideas, “one 
voice” (only one person speaks at a time), and maintaining the confidentiality of 
what is shared in the group. 
 
�
��
� Visuals 
It is very useful to post visuals and information around the meeting space.  You 
can post “teasers” – such single-word signs including “OSHA,” “HAZARD,” and 
“SAFE,” as well as signs with statistics you will review (injury rates, etc.).

The following agenda is intended to take approximately 10 hours to complete.  It can be 
shortened, and completed in a single day, or broken into two portions spread over two days.

a. 
Introduce yourself & role with the organization 
b. 
Introduce the host organization, e.g.: 
 
Make the Road New York builds the power of Latino and working class communities 
to achieve dignity and justice through organizing, policy innovation, transformative 
education, and survival services.  With nearly 9,000 members at our four 
community-based centers, we organize around workers’ rights issues – including 
helping workers fight to for workplaces that are safe and healthy. 
 
c. 
Go around the circle asking participants to introduce themselves by sharing: 
i. 
Their name 
ii. 
Their current job (or a recent job, if not working) 
iii. 
A movement that typifies what they do at work.  (You can kick of the round 
by demonstrating: for instance, “I am a teacher” – and mime some aspect of 
teaching.) 
 
 
� Keep track of names and jobs/industries.  You may divide groups according to 
jobs later in the day, if participants divide neatly into separate industries. 
 
d. 
Review the brief agenda & goals for the day 
Goal: For this group of community leaders and activists to learn about workplace 
hazards; workers’ legal rights to a safe workplace; and tactics and strategies workers 
can use to minimize risks in the workplace.  As leaders, participants will have the 
duty to share what they have learned with family, friends, and co-workers. 
 
Ask participants to add any other goals to this basic mission statement. 
 
Ask participants to set “Ground Rules” for the day – using the basics outlined above 
as a starting point.

GOAL: This activity is designed for the group to get a sense of how common unsafe working 
conditions are in the community.  You will read a series of questions and ask those answering 
“yes” to physically signal their response without speaking.   
� Step In/Step Out format.  Ask everyone to stand in a large circle.  Those 
answering “yes” to the question should take one step into the circle, while those 
answering “no” remain where they are. 
� Stand Up/Sit Down format.  If you do not have a lot of room, ask participants 
to simply stand up if their answer is “yes,” or to remain seated if “no.” 
Questions (create more question as are relevant to your participants) 
1) I have had to do work that I thought was unsafe at least once in a job. 
2) I have seen others do work that I thought was unsafe. 
3) I have been hurt on the job. 
4) I have seen someone else get hurt on the job. 
5) I have been hurt on the job so badly I had to go to the doctor. 
6) I know someone who has been hurt so badly on the job they had to go to the doctor.   
 
Reflection:  
How do participants feel having done the exercise?  What do they think about it?

GOAL: This activity is intended to set the historical stage for worker safety and health issues, 
and to familiarize participants with phrases such as “workplace safety,” “hazard,” and 
“occupational safety.”  The handout [Handout #1: Factory Story] is the story of the historic 
Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire, which occurred in 1911 near Washington Square Park in 
Manhattan.3   
Note: the participant handout does not include the date, the name of the factory, the location, 
or any details about the workers.  Have participants read the story aloud – and answer the 
discussion questions included on the handout and below.  This exercise is intended to show 
workers how worker safety and health risks continue – despite tragedies like this fire. 
Pass out Handout #1 to the group.  If all participants are comfortable reading aloud, have each 
participant read 1-2 sentences, going around in a circle until the entire story is completed.  If 
some participants are unable to read, ask for volunteers to read the story aloud.

Discussion Questions (also included on bottom of handout) 
1) Where in New York City do you think this took place?  What borough or 
neighborhood? 
2) What kind of factory do you think it was? 
3) What year do you think it happened? 
4) How many days a week and hours a day do you think these workers worked? 
5) Who do you think these workers were?  Where were they from?  Were the men 
or women?  How old do you think they were? 
6) What are some of the reasons this disaster happened? 
 
As you facilitate a discussion, fill in the actual facts of the tragedy: 
• The fire took place in New York City on March 25, 1911.  
• The factory was located at 23-29 Washington Place, between Greene Street and 
Washington Square East in Manhattan, New York City (Greenwich Village). 
• The Triangle Waist Company was one of the largest blouse makers in New York 
City, specializing in “shirtwaists,” the very popular women's blouse of the era.   
• 146 people died as a result of the fire: 129 women and 17 men. 
• Many of the workers were young women, most of them Italian and European 
Jewish immigrants between 16 and 23 years old.  Some were as young as 14.  
• They worked nine hours a day on weekdays, plus seven hours on Saturdays 
(notably less than many garment factory workers today). 
Current Day Snap Shot [Handout #2] 
End by reviewing statistics about injury rates today, for example:4 
� In 2009, the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics reported an average of 12 workers 
were killed every day on the job in the U.S.  (Total 4,340 workers a year.) 
� That same year, another 50,000 were killed from occupational disease – diseases 
caused by conditions at work. 
� Estimates suggest that about 8 million to 12 million job injuries or illnesses occur 
every year. 
� Latino workers continued to have a greater risk of job fatalities. There were 668 
fatalities among Latino workers.  Of those, 59% (393) were born outside the U.S.   
� The first federal law to protect workers’ health and safety on the job was not passed 
until 1970 – nearly 60 years after the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory Fire. 
Discussion: Spend a few minutes asking workers to comment on why so many workers are still 
hurt on the job and why the rates of fatalities are higher for Latino workers.

GOAL: for participants to start identifying safety hazards caused by physical risks – slippery 
floors, broken machinery, etc.  These are often the most obvious hazards, and the first that 
participants identify. 
 
GROUP BRAINSTORM: Ask for volunteers to give examples of a “hazard” on the job that might 
cause harm to a worker’s safety or health.  They can use examples from their own jobs, or using 
their imagination.   
 
If participants give an example of an injury, e.g., a burn, ask them to give the cause of the injury, 
e.g., hot oil or an open flame.  Explain that the cause of the injury is the workplace hazard. 
 
As the list of examples grows, point out that hazards fall in to different categories:  
 
1. Safety hazards: these are physical conditions that can cause harm, such as slippery 
floors, broken ladders, or high heat. 
2. Chemicals exposure: hazardous chemicals (cleaning products, chemicals used in 
production, etc.) are common in many jobs. 
3. Biological hazards: workers may get exposed to viruses or bacteria, blood, insects, or 
other biological hazards on the job. 
4. Misc. hazards: this can include things like workplace violence. 
 
Next, divide group up again into small groups of maximum 4 participants per group.  You can 
either keep groups the same as earlier, or mix participants up.  Tell participants they all work 
together at the ABC Garment Factory and that they are meeting after work one day to talk 
about some of the health and safety problems they are having on the job.   
 
Distribute:  
� 
Handout #3 – drawing of the ABC Garment Factory (one per participant) 
� 
Handout #4 – the health & safety checklist  
 
Review the example provided in the checklist to explain how to use the chart.  If people still 
seem uncertain, ask them to share another example of a hazard with the group, and the effect 
or injury it might cause.

From Handout #4: 
 
HAZARD & LOCATION 
EFFECT OR INJURY 
Example: 
Meat slicer / sharp blade 
Cuts 
 
 
Ask the groups to spend 20 minutes looking at the drawing, and imagining that they work in 
that environment.  What kind of safety risks are there?  What might threaten their health?  Ask 
them to write down every possible HAZARD or UNSAFE CONDITION that they think exists in the 
factory. 
 
Emphasize that they should use their: 
� EYES: imagine looking around at the factory 
� EARS: imagine listening to the typical sounds 
� NOSE: imagine what smells might be present 
 
Each group should choose a name for their group and a Secretary to take notes.  After about 
15-20 minutes, reconvene as a large group.  Taking turns, have each group read out one of the 
hazards they identified.  On butcher paper at the front, write up the answers.  Keep going 
around until all groups have shared all their hazards.   
 
Explain that you will return to this exercise in a little while.

GOAL: to help participants identify not only safety hazards that are obvious to the eye, but 
other more “invisible” hazards.  These hazards are sometimes identifiable more from the 
symptom than the hazard – you feel dizzy, your eyes water, your nose runs or itches, you get a 
headache, etc. 
 
Transition from the factory exercise by explaining that workers are often exposed to “invisible” 
hazards – for example, chemical or biological exposure.   
 
Distribute Handout #5, Maria’s Nail Salon.  Ask everyone to imagine that they work in this nail 
salon, six days a week, 10 hours a day.  Have them study the drawing, taking note of possible 
hazards in the picture.   
 
Teaching trick  �  You can also bring a bottle of hairspray to class and spray a bit and/or 
a bottle of nail polish and nail polish remover that you simply open and leave sitting out 
for a few minutes. 
 
Activity: explain that participants will each have the opportunity to act out, without using 
words, how they think they would feel after working in the nail salon for a few weeks.  Ask for 
4-5 volunteers to come to the front of the room to act out how they feel.  Have the rest of the 
group guess what the symptoms are.  Some examples could be: holding your head because it 
hurts; rubbing your eyes; blowing your nose: acting dizzy, etc.  You can act out one to get the 
group started. 
 
 
Questions:  
(1) What might be causing these symptoms? 
(2) How is this caused?  (Skin contact, breathe in chemicals or fumes, drink it)

GOAL: to help participants further identify how hazards impact their body and their health, as 
they started to do with the nail salon exercise.   Participants will identify both short-term 
problems – cuts, burns, accidents – as well as longer-term health impacts of hazards.   
 
Provide each participant with a large piece of butcher paper, markers, and dot stickers in 
different colors.  Ask them to draw the outline of their own body and label their page at the top 
with (1) their name and (2) their job.  Ask them to take 10 minutes to put stickers on their body 
map indicating where they have pain, stress, or injuries from their job.  Encourage them to note 
both immediate pains – from cuts or burns – as well as longer-term pains – muscle aches, 
breathing problems, etc.   
 
If you prefer, you can ask participants to complete Handout #6 for the body mapping. 
 
Report-back: depending on the group, you can have workers report-back in small groups 
divided by type of job or industry.  If the large group is very diverse, in terms of types of jobs, 
create mixed groups and ask workers to spend 2 minutes per person explaining their body map 
to the group. 
 
Large group discussion: Ask participants to share any reactions to what they learned from the 
activity.  Did they see any patterns?  What kinds of health impacts did participants notice most 
frequently?  In leading the discussion, help the group identify and discuss longer-term health 
consequences of workplace hazards, such as long-term respiratory problems, ergonomic issues, 
etc.

GOAL: Now that participants have identified hazards, and explored how hazards impact their 
health, these activities will help participants think about steps they can take to deal with 
hazards in the workplace.   
 
Explain to participants that now that they have started identifying the hazards at the ABC 
Garment Factory and at Maria’s Nail Salon, they are going to brainstorm ways to lessen or get 
rid of these hazards.  Explain that their goals, in order of importance should be to:  
 
REMOVE, CONTROL & PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT. 
 
This means: 
1) Removing the hazard.  The best option is to completely get rid of the hazard 
altogether.  For example, you could substitute non-toxic materials or replace broken 
equipment.  But…. 
2) Controlling the hazard.  It is not always possible to completely remove a hazard.  In 
that case, your next question should be: how can you control it?  How can you 
minimize it?  Consider both administrative and engineering controls. 
a. There might be physical changes – mats for slippery floors; guards on machines, 
that help lessen the danger. 
b. There might be way to train workers to work more safely, etc. 
3) Protecting against the hazard.  The last line of defense is to protect against the 
hazard by providing workers with personal protective equipment (“PPE”) – like 
gloves, masks, etc. 
 
Write (1) REMOVE, (2) CONTROL, (3) PPE on butcher paper at the front of the room.

Make the Road New York � Immigrant Workers’ Health & Safety � Train the Trainer Curriculum 
 
 
 
For 20 minutes in their small groups, have the participants revisit either the ABC Factory or 
Maria’s Nail Salon (their choice), and brainstorm solutions using this chart from Handout #7: 
 
Hazard 
Solution 
Example: 
Meat slicer / sharp blade 
Guards on machine; training workers to use; lock-out to 
shut off machine if there is jam, etc. 
 
As they brainstorm, they should:  
(1) Include solutions that are specific and relevant to the situation;  
(2) Indicate whether the solutions involve removing, controlling, or protecting against 
the hazard; and  
(3) Note which solutions workers can take on their own, and  which solutions require 
the employer to take action.  
(4) Flag the 3-4 best solutions to a hazard that they are proposing. 
 
Report back: each group should spend 5 minutes reporting back on the 3-4 best solutions they 
brainstormed as a group.   
 
GROUP DISCUSSION: Ask for commentaries from the group based on the activity.  Ask them in 
particular to talk about what solutions workers can implement on their own, and what solutions 
require the employer’s involvement.  As the facilitator, you should help manage the 
conversation – challenge the group when solutions are not realistic, raise other ideas that occur 
to you but that do not come out in the group discussion, etc.

GOAL: To orient the group to their basic legal rights under federal and state law to work in a 
safe and healthy workplace.   
 
Remind participants about the activities they did at the end of the prior day: they identified 
hazards, and proposed solutions.  Remind participants that some of the most important 
solutions they proposed require the employer to take steps.   
 
Poll participants: what do you think the boss would do if you made these suggestions at work?  
Explain that you will now review workers’ basic legal rights. 
 
Ask the group to share: 
1) the name of the federal law that protects workers’ safety and health on the job 
2) the name of the federal agency that enforces this law 
 
� Write up on the board or on paper “OSHA” – explain that OSHA, which is part of the 
Department of Labor, enforces the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, the main 
law that protects workers on the job.   
 
� Ask the group to guess what year the law was passed: answer is 1970. 
 
Explain that the OSH Act applies to:  
1) Basically all workers and 
2) It applies to workers regardless of their immigration status.5 
 
OSHA works to:  
1) develop rules about workplace safety;  
2) enforce those rules through inspecting workplaces;  
3) track workplace accidents; and  
                                                 
5 Workers typically not covered by OSHA include the self-employed; immediate family members of farm employers 
who do not employ any outside employees; and workers covered under another federal law (such as mineworkers 
or those in the Coast Guard).

4) train workers and employees on workplace health and safety. 
 
Explain that you have 5 basic rights under OSHA.  Ask group to brainstorm what these rights 
might be – write ideas up on the board.  Then review the 5 key rights: 
 
1) A healthy and safe workplace; 
2) Information; 
3) Training; 
4) To request that an unsafe workplace situation be changed (and to file a complaint with 
OSHA about it); and 
5) Protection from retaliation for reporting unsafe working conditions. 
 
� Distribute Handout #8, workers rights under OSHA. 
 
Go back one by one to discuss them in more depth. 
 
1) Healthy and safe workplace:  
a. You have the legal right to work free from known hazards that can cause death 
or serious physical harm to you.  This includes having tools and equipment that is 
in good condition an regularly maintained. 
b. Where an unsafe condition exists, an employer must first attempt to reduce a 
hazard to a safe level by using engineering or administrative control, for example 
by substituting less hazardous materials or work practices. 
c. If engineering and administrative controls cannot adequately reduce the hazard 
of the working condition, then an employer must provide a worker personal 
protective equipment (PPE) at no cost to the worker.   
 
2) Information: 
a. Your rights as a worker – the OSHA poster.  Distribute copies of the poster and 
ask if participants have seen it posted at their job. 
b. Information on dangerous chemicals used in your job.   
i. Explain that employers must have Material Safety Data Sheets for all 
hazardous chemicals used.  Distribute the sample MSDS for review.   
ii. Employers are to provide training on hazardous chemicals that can be 
understood by the worker (including in the worker’s primary language).  
c. Information on injuries or illnesses that happen at your worksite. 
i. If there are more than 10 workers on the job, the employer must keep an 
OSHA 300 log of all injuries and illnesses. 
d. Copies of your own medical records, if kept by the employer.

14 
Make the Road New York � Immigrant Workers’ Health & Safety � Train the Trainer Curriculum 
 
 
3) Training: your employer must train you to perform your job safely, according to the 
OSHA rules that apply.   
 
4) Reporting unsafe working conditions.  You can: 
a. Ask your employer to correct unsafe working conditions;  
b. File a complaint with OSHA anonymously about the condition; 
c. Participate in the OSHA investigation and get information about the resolution. 
d. Workers should call OSHA immediately (1-800-321-OSHA) to report imminent 
dangers.  To count as an “imminent” danger, there must be: 
i. A threat of death or serious physical harm (meaning such severe harm to 
a part of your body you will lose use or not be able to use it well). 
ii. Exposure to a health hazard (e.g., a chemical) that will shorten the 
worker’s life or substantially reduce the worker’s physical or mental 
abilities (harm does not have to happen immediately). 
 
5) Protection against retaliation:6  
a. Your employer can’t retaliate against you for reporting an unsafe condition or 
participating in an OSHA investigation.  Report instances of retaliation to OSHA 
immediately, but no later than 30 days after it happens! 
 
QUESTION: When can a worker refuse to do unsafe work and be protected against retaliation? 
� OSHA does not necessarily protect a worker who refuses to do work as ordered by 
the employer, even if that work may be unsafe.  Refusing work can result in discipline 
by the employer.   
� However, if a worker reasonably believes, in good faith, that they are being exposed 
to an imminent danger, the worker may refuse to perform the work as ordered.   
o "Good faith" means that even if an imminent danger is not found to exist, 
the worker had reasonable grounds to believe that it did exist. 
o As noted above, “imminent dangers” are serious, immediate dangers that 
are likely to cause serious injury.   
� While you may have a right to refuse to engage in work that presents an imminent 
danger, you do not have the right to walk off the job.   
 
                                                 
6 The information on retaliation is drawn nearly verbatim from OSHA’s guide, found at: 
www.osha.gov/dte/outreach/intro_osha/intro_to_osha_guide.pdf.

15 
Make the Road New York � Immigrant Workers’ Health & Safety � Train the Trainer Curriculum 
 
When might you decide to refuse to do work that presents an imminent danger?  Your right 
to refuse to do a task is protected if all of the following conditions are met: 
(1) Where possible, you have asked the employer to eliminate the danger, and the 
employer failed to do so; and 
(2) You refused to work in "good faith." This means that you must genuinely believe 
that an imminent danger exists. Your refusal cannot be a disguised attempt to harass 
your employer or disrupt business; and 
(3) A reasonable person would agree that there is a real danger of death or serious 
injury; and 
(4) There isn't enough time, due to the urgency of the hazard, to get it corrected 
through regular enforcement channels, such as requesting an OSHA inspection. 
When all of these conditions are met, you should take the following steps: 
(1) Ask your employer to correct the hazard; 
(2) Ask your employer for other work; 
(3) Tell your employer that you won't perform the work unless and until the hazard is 
corrected; and 
(4) Remain at the worksite until ordered to leave by your employer. 
� If your employer discriminates against you for refusing to perform the dangerous 
work, contact OSHA immediately. 
When you file your complaint, you must demonstrate that: 
1) You were engaged in activity protected under the Act, such as notifying your 
employer of an unsafe working condition; 
2) Your employer knew about your protected activity; and 
3) It was because of your protected activity that the employer took adverse action 
against you. 
Adverse action is generally defined as any action that would dissuade a reasonable employee 
from engaging in protected activity. Depending upon the circumstances of the case, "adverse" 
action can include: 
• Firing or laying off 
• Blacklisting 
• Demoting 
• Denying overtime or promotion

GOAL: for participants to synthesize the information they have learned in an interactive activity 
that can be used to train other groups of workers. 
 
Explain that each small group will have 25 minutes to prepare a skit that incorporates what they 
have learned from the training.  Participants are free to choose the focus on their skit: they can 
revisit earlier activities/examples and use those for the substance of the skit; they can “invent” 
a workplace; or they can use an example from their own lives.  Emphasize that the groups will 
have limited time to develop their full skit, so they should focus on building the skit rather than 
spending time choosing a topic.   
 
The skits should be 8-10 minutes long.  Each skit should: 
1) Illustrate a group of workers dealing with some kind of hazard at their job; 
2) Make clear what the hazard is that is a problem;  
3) Show what harm that hazard is causing; 
4) Illustrate tactics the workers can use to lessen the risk of the hazard. 
 
Give the groups 25 minutes to prepare and practice their skits.  You can reconfigure groups so 
that there are 4 small groups who will then perform their skit to the large group.  Have each 
group perform their skit, and give 5 minutes after the skit for group feedback.

GOAL: to review what participants have learned, what they liked best about the training, how 
they will use their knowledge to reach other workers, and goals in their own jobs. 
Have participants go around in a circle and share with the group, in one minute or less: 
� 
One thing they learned at the training; 
� 
One thing they will do differently in their job based on what they learned; and 
� 
One idea about how they can share what they have learned with other workers. 
Distribute the Post-Test and ask participants to spend 10 minutes completing it.  Collect the 
tests.   
After collecting the tests, spend 5-10 minutes taking questions from participants.  Was there 
anything they didn’t remember or had questions about, especially after taking the test?  Any 
areas where they would like more information? 
Next: distribute Handout #9, the Plan of Action.  Explain to participants that they should now 
each spend 10 minutes on their own, thinking about what commitment they can make to 
sharing the information they learned with their community.   
Have participants break up in to their small groups and spend 15 minutes presenting their Plans 
of Action to each other.  Come back as a large group, and ask participants to share any last 
thoughts or ideas with the large group. 
If you have prepared certificates ahead of time, distribute certificates to participants.  (If not, 
tell participants you will mail them their certificate.) 
End with a Unity Clap.  Have participants stand in a circle, and begin clapping in unison slowly.  
Slowly increase the speed of clapping, and as the momentum builds, the group converges in the 
middle with a shout of “Sí se puede!” or “Yes we can!”

March 25, 4:40pm. A fire breaks out in a factory in a 10-story building.  There is no fire alarm in 
the factory, which occupies the 8th, 9th, and 10th floors. Workers on the 8th floor phone upstairs 
to workers on the 10th to warn them.  But there is no way to contact workers on the 9th floor. 
Workers begin to panic, desperate to escape the spreading fire.  But there is only a small 
elevator located in the back of the building and one stairway. Every day, the managers lock all 
the other doors, exits, and the front elevator to prevent employee “theft.”  
The building has only one fire escape, which is poorly built and in disrepair.  It quickly gives way, 
causing workers to fall nearly 100 ft. 
The fire department arrives on the scene, but their ladders only reach the 6th floor.  They 
unwind their hoses, but water pressure is weak – and the stream of water only reaches the 7th 
floor.  Their nets are weak, and fail to hold workers leaping from the burning building. 
The building doors open inwards, rather than out, causing further chaos as panicked workers 
try to flee.  
By the end of the disaster, 146 of the approximately 500 workers in the factory died that day.  
Sixty-two of those who died had jumped, fallen or were pushed from the top floors windows. 
Tragically, there had already been four fires reported in this factory previously.  Investigations 
later showed the fire started when a cigarette was thrown in a waste bin that had accumulated 
over two months’ worth of trash.  
  
Questions for Discussion: 
1. Where in New York City do you think this took place?  What borough or neighborhood? 
2. What kind of factory do you think it was? 
3. What year do you think it happened? 
4. How many days a week and hours a day do you think these workers worked? 
5. Who do you think these workers were?  Where were they from?  Were the men or 
women?  How old do you think they were? 
6. What are some of the reasons this disaster happened?

25 de marzo, 4:40pm. Comienza un incendio en una fábrica localizada en un edificio de 10 
pisos. No hay alarma de incendios en la fábrica, que ocupa el octavo, noveno y décimo piso. Los 
trabajadores en el octavo piso llaman por teléfono a los trabajadores del décimo piso para 
advertirles. Sin embargo no hay forma de contactar a los trabajadores del noveno piso.  
Los trabajadores entran en pánico, desesperados por escapar del incendio que se va 
extendiendo por toda la fábrica. Pero sólo hay un ascensor pequeño localizado en la parte de 
atrás del edificio y unas escaleras. Todos los días, los gerentes cerraban las demás puertas, 
salidas y el otro ascensor en la parte frontal al edificio para prevenir que los empleados 
“robaran” mercancía. 
El edificio sólo tiene una escalera de incendios, que está mal construida y en mal estado. 
Rápidamente se descompone, provocando que los trabajadores caigan desde una altura de casi 
100 pies.  
El departamento de incendios llega al lugar, pero sus escaleras sólo llegan al sexto piso. Utilizan 
sus mangueras, pero la presión de agua es débil, y la corriente de agua sólo llega el séptimo 
piso. Las redes son débiles, y no logran para atrapar a las personas que van cayendo desde el 
edificio en llamas. 
Las puertas del edificio abren hacia adentro en vez de hacia afuera, causando aún más caos 
mientras los trabajadores están desesperados por salir. 
 Al final de la catástrofe, 146 de los aproximadamente 500 trabajadores en la fábrica murieron 
ese día. 62 de las víctimas saltaron, se cayeron o fueron empujados desde las ventanas del 
edificio. 
Trágicamente, ya habían ocurrido cuatro incendios en esta fábrica anteriormente. Al hacer una 
investigación del incidente, se cree que el incendio comenzó al echar un cigarrillo en un cubo de 
basura que tenía acumulada la basura de aproximadamente 2 meses.  
Preguntas de discusión 
1. ¿En qué lugar de Nueva York crees que ocurrió este evento? ¿En qué barrio o 
vecindario?  
2. ¿Qué tipo de fábrica crees que era? 
3. ¿En qué año crees que sucedió? 
4. ¿Cuántos días a la semana y horas al día crees que estos trabajadores trabajaban? 
5. ¿Quiénes crees que eran estos trabajadores? ¿De dónde eran? ¿Eran hombres o 
mujeres? ¿Qué edades crees que tenían?  
6. ¿Cuáles son algunas de las razones por las cuales sucedió este desastre?

Workers, regardless of immigration status, have the following rights under OSHA:

personal protective equipment (PPE) to protect you from the hazard.   
 
2) Information about: 
a. Dangerous chemicals used in your job.   
b. Information on injuries or illnesses that happen at your worksite. 
i. If there are more than 10 workers on the job, the employer must keep an 
OSHA 300 log of all injuries and illnesses. 
c. Your rights as a worker. 
 
3) Training about how to perform your job safely, according to the OSHA rules that apply.   
 
4) Reporting unsafe working conditions.  You can:

workers should call OSHA immediately (1-800-321-OSHA).  
b. File a complaint with OSHA anonymously about the condition. 
c. Participate in OSHA investigations and get information about the resolution. 
 
5) Protection against retaliation:  
a. Your employer can’t retaliate against you for reporting an unsafe condition or 
participating in an OSHA investigation.  Report instances of retaliation to OSHA 
immediately, but no later than 30 days after it happens!
