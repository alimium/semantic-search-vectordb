SUBJECT:
Final Audit Report - The Internal Revenue Service Needs to
Encourage Taxpayer Use, Improve Customer Service, and
Enhance Computer Controls of the 941 TeleFile Program
This report presents the results of our review of the 1998 TeleFile Program used
by small business taxpayers to file an Employer’s Quarterly Federal Tax Return
(Form 941).  We evaluated the effectiveness of the Internal Revenue Service’s (IRS)
processes for ensuring that the 1998 Form 941 TeleFile Program was successfully
implemented.  This was the first year for nationwide TeleFile processing of Forms 941.
In summary, we found that the IRS established effective processes for ensuring that the
941 TeleFile Program was successfully implemented.  The vast majority of Form 941
TeleFile returns filed in 1998 were accurately processed and posted to the IRS'
Business Masterfile.  However, to achieve its long-term goals of increased 941 TeleFile
Program participation, the IRS needs to encourage eligible taxpayers to use the system,
educate taxpayers on program changes, and provide quality customer service to all
TeleFile users.  In addition, improvements to the 941 TeleFile System would prevent the
filing of multiple returns by a taxpayer and would allow the system to verify the filing
history and electronic signature of TeleFile users.
The report recommends that the IRS analyze customer feedback information gathered
in 1997 during the 941 TeleFile Program limited expansion to identify ways to increase
participation.  It also recommends that the IRS educate taxpayers on the requirements
for using the 941 TeleFile System, as well as any program changes, and ensure quality
customer service.  In addition, the report recommends enhancements to the system to
prevent the processing of duplicate Form 941 TeleFile returns and to verify the filing
2
history and electronic signatures of the taxpayers, or taxpayer representatives, who file
Form 941 TeleFile returns.
The Chief Operations Officer agreed with the facts cited in the report and is taking
appropriate corrective actions.  Management’s comments have been incorporated into
the report where appropriate, and the full text of their comments is included as an
appendix.
Copies of this report are also being sent to the IRS managers who are affected by the
report recommendations.  Please contact me at (202) 622-6510 if you have questions,
or your staff may call Scott E. Wilson, Associate Inspector General for Audit
(Information Systems Programs), at (202) 622-8510.

Executive Summary
TeleFile is an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) voice response system that allows
taxpayers to file tax returns using a touch-tone telephone.  In 1997, the IRS expanded the
Telefile System to allow a limited number of small business taxpayers to file the
Employer’s Quarterly Federal Tax Return (Form 941) through the 941 TeleFile System.
In 1998, TeleFile was further expanded to allow small businesses nationwide to use the
system.  For the first six months of 1998, almost 460,000 Form 941 returns were filed
using the 941 TeleFile System.  TeleFile is an important initiative in the IRS’ overall
plans to increase electronic filing of tax returns.  The IRS has a goal of 16 million
employment tax returns being filed electronically by the year 2002.
The TeleFile Program is coordinated through the National Office and includes all of the
activities that enable taxpayers to file tax returns using the Telefile System.  The
objective of this audit was to evaluate the effectiveness of the IRS’ processes for ensuring
that the 1998 941 TeleFile Program was successfully implemented.
Results
The 941 TeleFile Program experienced a successful 1998 filing season, its first year of
nationwide use (for the period January 1998 through the end of our fieldwork in
November 1998).  The IRS had effectively corrected prior audit findings, and ensured
that Form 941 tax returns were accurately processed through the Telefile System and
recorded on the taxpayers’ accounts in the IRS’ computer systems.  However, to achieve
the long-term goals of the 941 TeleFile Program, the IRS needs to:
• Encourage eligible taxpayers to use the 941 TeleFile Program.
• Provide quality customer service to TeleFile users.
• Improve 941 TeleFile computer controls to prevent taxpayers from filing multiple
returns and allow the system to verify a TeleFile user’s filing history and
electronic signature.
The Internal Revenue Service Needs to Encourage Eligible Taxpayers to
Use the 941 TeleFile Program
The customer feedback information gathered during the 1997 limited expansion
should be used to increase 941 TeleFile Program participation.  The IRS obtained
information from taxpayers who chose not to use the 941 TeleFile System.  This
customer feedback showed that many taxpayers had not used the 941 TeleFile System
either because they used a paid preparer or because they wanted a paper copy of the
Page

The Internal Revenue Service Needs to Encourage Taxpayer Use, Improve
Customer Service, and Enhance Computer Controls of the 941 TeleFile Program
return.  This information could have been used to focus the IRS’ marketing efforts to
address any taxpayer misconceptions about the system.  During 1998, there was no
significant increase in the percentage of eligible taxpayers who used the TeleFile
Program.  The IRS needs to focus its marketing efforts to encourage more taxpayers to
use the 941 TeleFile System.  This will enable the IRS to achieve its goal of 16 million
electronically filed employment tax returns by the year 2002.
The Internal Revenue Service Needs to Provide Quality Customer
Service to TeleFile Users
A more effective method for resolving taxpayer problems needs to be established.
The IRS has not implemented a process for delivering effective one-stop customer
service to taxpayers using the 941 TeleFile Program (correctly handling their questions or
concerns during their first contact with the IRS).  Taxpayers with questions regarding
Form 941 TeleFile returns are instructed to contact a customer service call site.  The call
site representative will then either contact the TeleFile Coordinator to ask the question for
the taxpayer or will instruct the taxpayer to contact the Coordinator directly.
Taxpayers should be informed when they are no longer eligible to participate in the
941 TeleFile Program.  If a taxpayer’s annual Form 941 liability exceeds a certain dollar
criteria, then the taxpayer is no longer eligible to use the 941 TeleFile System.  The IRS
has no procedures to notify taxpayers of this and to suggest other electronic methods for
filing the Form 941 returns.
The 941 TeleFile forms and instructions should be timely updated to reflect
program changes.  The 941 TeleFile tax package (which includes the forms and
instructions mailed to taxpayers) was not timely updated to indicate that the IRS would
accept returns with a higher balance due amount than had been accepted previously.
Some taxpayers may not have used the 941 TeleFile System because of the incorrect
instructions.
The Internal Revenue Service Needs to Improve 941 TeleFile Computer
Controls to Prevent Taxpayers From Filing Multiple Returns and Allow
the System to Verify a TeleFile User’s Filing History and Electronic
Signature
The 941 TeleFile System should prevent multiple returns from being filed by a
taxpayer.  Normally, TeleFile returns are received at one processing site, with a backup
site available to handle the excess volume.  If both sites are receiving returns, and a
taxpayer files a second (amended) return on the same day the first (original) return was
filed, both returns could be accepted by TeleFile if the returns were processed at separate
sites.  The IRS would not be aware of the potential duplicate or amended return because
data from the two sites are only merged and updated at the end of the day.  When this
occurs, TeleFile always processes the return received at the main processing site, and not
Page ii
The Internal Revenue Service Needs to Encourage Taxpayer Use, Improve
Customer Service, and Enhance Computer Controls of the 941 TeleFile Program
the return from the backup site, even though the taxpayer may have intended otherwise.
While this should not be a common occurrence, we performed some limited testing and
identified several instances where a taxpayer filed more than one return on the same day.
This is a systemic problem that will be compounded as the population of TeleFile users
increases.
The look-back period could be used to ensure businesses are authenticated
(i.e., verified) to use the 941 TeleFile System.  The IRS requires taxpayers to be in
business for at least 12 months before using the 941 TeleFile System.  However, the
existing 941 TeleFile System will accept and process returns from taxpayers, even though
they are not authenticated to use the 941 TeleFile System.  The IRS has a current process
in place (the look-back period) that could be used to provide the IRS with more assurance
that taxpayers have an established filing history when using the 941 TeleFile System.
The process for verifying the electronic signature of 941 TeleFile System users needs
to be improved.  There is not an effective process to ensure that returns filed using the
941 TeleFile System were actually filed by the taxpayers or their representatives.  The
process for verifying the electronic signatures of the taxpayers is incomplete because
(1) only a sample of the electronic signatures are verified as correct, and (2) there are no
procedures for following up on invalid signatures.
Summary of Recommendations
The IRS should analyze the customer feedback information gathered during the
1997 limited expansion to determine how 941 TeleFile Program participation can be
increased.  In addition, the IRS needs to ensure 941 TeleFile Program taxpayers are given
quality customer service when resolving taxpayer problems with the 941 TeleFile
Program.  Also, the 941 TeleFile computer controls need to be enhanced to prevent
duplicate Form 941 returns from being filed and to improve the process for verifying the
filing history and electronic signature of taxpayers using the 941 TeleFile System.
Management’s Response:  IRS management agreed with the conditions cited in the report
and has designed and, in some instances, implemented actions to correct the problems.
To improve its marketing effort to increase participation in the 941 TeleFile Program, the
IRS has contracted with a vendor to develop a comprehensive marketing and
communication strategy that will focus on the Form 941 products.  In addition, the IRS
has made several enhancements and clarifications to the 1998 TeleFile tax package to
address customer feedback received in 1997 and 1998.
To ensure 941 TeleFile Program taxpayers are given quality customer service, the IRS
will update the instructions for its telephone representatives to include additional program
detail, processing guidelines, and questions and answers.  In addition, the IRS tested an

Customer Service, and Enhance Computer Controls of the 941 TeleFile Program
Employment Tax call site for small businesses this past filing season and, based on the
favorable results, plans to request the establishment of the call site.
To prevent duplicate returns from being filed, the IRS has implemented a process to
eliminate duplicate returns when multiple sites are used to process returns.  To improve
the process for verifying the identity of taxpayers using TeleFile, the IRS will redesign
the return filing confirmation number to make it unique for each taxpayer.

and, therefore, do not correspond directly with the recommendation numbers shown in
Appendix VI.)

Objective and Scope
The overall objective was to
evaluate the effectiveness of
the IRS’ processes for
ensuring that the 1998 941
TeleFile Program was
successfully implemented.
The TeleFile Program for the Employer’s Quarterly
Federal Tax Return (Form 941) was designed to provide
businesses with flexible and convenient ways to file
returns.  The overall objective of the audit was to evaluate
the effectiveness of the Internal Revenue Service’s (IRS)
processes for ensuring that the 1998 941 TeleFile Program
was successfully implemented.
Specifically, we:
• Evaluated actions taken in response to a prior audit
report titled, “Evaluation of the 1997 TeleFile Pilot -
Business Masterfile” (Reference Number 080704,
Dated December 2, 1997) on the 1997 TeleFile
limited expansion for Form 941 tax returns.
• Evaluated the effectiveness of the IRS’ processes for
ensuring Form 941 TeleFile returns were accurately
processed nationwide.
• Evaluated the effectiveness of the IRS’ publicity
efforts to increase the number of businesses that file
returns using the 941 TeleFile System.
The review was conducted between July 1998 and
November 1998 at the National Office and the
Cincinnati Service Center (CSC), with limited testing at
the Tennessee (TCC) and Martinsburg Computing
Centers (MCC).  These centers are the IRS offices
where TeleFile returns are filed and processed.  We
performed this review in accordance with Government
Auditing Standards.
Appendix I provides the detailed objective, scope, and
methodology used to conduct the audit; Appendix II lists
the major contributors to this report; and Appendix III
reflects the Report Distribution List.
During the review, we issued two audit memoranda
communicating several issues requiring immediate
attention.  This report presents a summary of the
two memoranda and additional audit results completed
Page 1
The Internal Revenue Service Needs to Encourage Taxpayer Use, Improve
Customer Service, and Enhance Computer Controls of the 941 TeleFile Program
after the memoranda were issued.  IRS management
responded to the first memorandum.  A copy of the first
memorandum and management’s response are included
in Appendices IV and V, respectively.
Background
TeleFile is a voice response system that allows
taxpayers to file tax returns using a touch-tone
telephone.  The Telefile System uses Electronic Filing
(ELF) to process returns.  The Program is coordinated
through the Electronic Tax Administration (ETA) Office
at the National Office and includes all of the activities
that enable taxpayers to file tax returns using the Telefile
System.  Beginning in 1996, the TeleFile Program
enabled individual taxpayers across the nation to file
returns over the telephone.  The IRS expanded the
Program in 1997 by allowing a limited number of small
business taxpayers to file Form 941 returns through the
941 TeleFile System.
On December 2, 1997, the IRS Inspection Service (now
Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration)
issued a report titled, “Evaluation of the 1997 TeleFile
Pilot - Business Masterfile.”  The purpose of that audit
was to evaluate controls over the 941 TeleFile Program
and determine whether it was properly implemented.
We concluded that the IRS experienced a successful
limited expansion with 48,834 Form 941 returns filed
and 99 percent of the businesses able to access the
system on their first attempt.  However, the following
issues were also identified:
• The 941 TeleFile Program allowed new
businesses and businesses that were not current
with their filing requirements to participate in the
Program.
• Taxpayers in the 941 TeleFile Program were not
always properly verified.
• Instructions in the Form 941 TeleFile package
contained an error that could be confusing to
taxpayers.

Customer Service, and Enhance Computer Controls of the 941 TeleFile Program
ETA management agreed with
the results from the prior
report and established plans
for corrective action.
ETA management generally agreed with our
recommendations and established plans for corrective
action.  In 1998, TeleFile was further expanded to allow
small business taxpayers nationwide to file Form 941
returns electronically.
Results
Nationwide implementation of
the 941 TeleFile Program was
successful.
Overall, the IRS has established effective processes for
ensuring that the 941 TeleFile Program was successfully
implemented.  For example, Form 941 TeleFile returns
filed in 1998 were accurately processed and posted to
the taxpayers’ accounts.  In addition, the IRS
implemented corrective actions from the 1997 audit,
which increased assurances that only authorized
taxpayers participated in the Program.
Nearly 460,000 employment tax returns were filed for
the first six months of calendar year 1998 using the
941 TeleFile System.  In addition, approximately
94 percent of the business taxpayers that attempted to
file over the telephone in the second quarter of calendar
year 1998 were successful.  The remaining six percent
of the taxpayers were either not allowed by the IRS to
complete their TeleFile return because they did not meet
the eligibility requirements or they hung-up before
completing their return.
Additional actions are needed
to ensure the IRS achieves its
goal of 16 million employment
tax returns being filed
electronically by the
year 2002.
Although the IRS had a successful 1998 filing season
(January 1998 through December 1998) for the
941 TeleFile Program, additional actions are needed to
market the 941 TeleFile Program to eligible users and to
improve customer service for TeleFile users.
Improvements in these two areas should enhance the
IRS’ ability to achieve its goal of 16 million
employment tax returns being filed electronically by the
year 2002.  The IRS needs to improve its marketing and
customer service by:
• Using the customer feedback information gathered
during the 1997 limited expansion to increase
TeleFile Program participation.
Page 3
The Internal Revenue Service Needs to Encourage Taxpayer Use, Improve
Customer Service, and Enhance Computer Controls of the 941 TeleFile Program
• Establishing a more effective method for resolving
taxpayer problems with the 941 TeleFile Program.
• Informing taxpayers when they are no longer eligible
to participate in the 941 TeleFile Program.
• Ensuring that 941 TeleFile Program forms and
instructions are timely updated to reflect program
changes.
Our review also showed that improvements to the
TeleFile computer controls would help ensure that the
correct return is processed by:
Improvements to the computer
controls would prevent a
taxpayer from filing more than
one return per day.
• Preventing the filing of multiple returns by a
taxpayer.
• Using the look-back period to ensure businesses
using the 941 TeleFile System are authenticated
(i.e., verified) to use the system.
• Improving the process of verifying the electronic
signatures of 941 TeleFile System users.
The Internal Revenue Service Needs to
Encourage Eligible Taxpayers to Use the 941
TeleFile Program
The IRS has not used customer
feedback from 1997 to identify
ways to better market the
Program to eligible users.
The IRS should use the customer feedback
information gathered during the 1997 limited
expansion to increase 941 TeleFile Program
participation.  We found no evidence that the IRS
focused its marketing on the 941 TeleFile Program
non-users (those 941 filers who were eligible to use
TeleFile but did not do so) to increase the number of
businesses participating in the Program.
The IRS obtained customer feedback information during
the 1997 Customer Satisfaction Survey, which included
the reasons why taxpayers used or did not use the
Telefile System.  Customer feedback obtained from
eligible non-users of the 941 TeleFile Program indicated
that:
Page 4
The Internal Revenue Service Needs to Encourage Taxpayer Use, Improve
Customer Service, and Enhance Computer Controls of the 941 TeleFile Program
• Approximately 39 percent of eligible non-users
employed a paid tax preparer (called a third-
party preparer) to complete and file their
quarterly returns.
• Another 23 percent of the businesses did not use
the Program because they wanted a copy of the
return.
No marketing strategy was
developed for the 941 TeleFile
Program.
The IRS does not know why the third-party preparers
did not file clients' returns electronically.  The TeleFile
team that measures quality recommended that the IRS
market and educate third-party preparers to increase
future use of the 941 TeleFile Program.  However, the
ETA office did not use the information gathered or
prepare a 941 TeleFile Program marketing strategy for
calendar year 1998 and there were no coordinated
nationwide efforts toward third-party preparers.  During
1998, IRS employees again traveled around the country
to obtain customer feedback from businesses.  The
feedback contained some of the same issues as the
previous year, further emphasizing the need for the IRS
to analyze and use this information to address any
taxpayer misconceptions about the System.
The National Office also did not provide any of the
marketing information to the district TeleFile
coordinators after nationwide implementation of the
941 TeleFile Program.  These employees were
responsible for marketing the 941 TeleFile Program and
indicated that they received no marketing information
specifically on the 941 TeleFile Program from the
National Office.  In addition, we were informed that the
overall ETA marketing strategy efforts in 1998 focused
primarily on the IRS’ TeleFile Program for individual
taxpayers (known as “Individual Masterfile (IMF)
TeleFile”), and not on the 941 TeleFile Program.
The IRS sent TeleFile tax packages to eligible taxpayers
in 1998; however, the lack of emphasis on marketing the
941 TeleFile Program in 1998 may be reflected in the
low volume of participation in the Program.  We
determined that the percentage of eligible filers using
the Telefile System in 1998 was almost the same as
Page 5
The Internal Revenue Service Needs to Encourage Taxpayer Use, Improve
Customer Service, and Enhance Computer Controls of the 941 TeleFile Program
1997 (6.7 percent of the eligible filers in 1998 compared
to 6.2 percent in 1997).  Through the second quarter of
calendar year 1998, approximately 460,000 employment
tax returns were filed by businesses using the 941
TeleFile System.  Unless there is a significant increase
in the number of 941 TeleFile returns filed for the
second half of calendar year 1998, the IRS will be about
24 percent below its estimate of 1.2 million 941 TeleFile
returns filed for 1998.
The IRS has taken steps to improve its marketing efforts
by contracting with an outside vendor to develop a
strategy for marketing the 941 TeleFile Program.  The
contract will go into effect the first quarter of calendar
year 1999.  With the emphasis on customer service and
on increasing the number of electronic returns, the IRS
needs to consider any information that could be used to
help achieve its goal of 16 million employment tax
returns being filed electronically by the year 2002.
Recommendations
1. The IRS needs to improve its marketing towards
eligible businesses to increase participation in the
941 TeleFile Program.  Specific actions include:
• Using the non-users’ customer feedback
responses to determine where to concentrate
marketing efforts (i.e., third party preparers).
• Clarifying the 941 TeleFile Program instructions
and educational material to address taxpayers’
misconceptions with the system (e.g., informing
taxpayers that they will receive a confirmation
number as proof of filing).
The IRS has evaluated the
non-user responses from the
1997 limited expansion and
will continue to use tax
packages as its primary
method for communicating
directly with eligible users.
Management’s Response: The IRS has evaluated the
non-user responses and determined that since the IRS
identifies eligible users prior to filing, and sends tax
packages to those taxpayers, it will continue to
emphasize a direct marketing approach by using the tax
packages to communicate messages directly to eligible
users.
ETA management has written tax package instructions
to be easy to read and understand.  They have also
Page 6
The Internal Revenue Service Needs to Encourage Taxpayer Use, Improve
Customer Service, and Enhance Computer Controls of the 941 TeleFile Program
addressed many misconceptions of users, eligible non-
users, and tax preparers.  For example, the instruction
regarding proof of filing or return acceptance has been
revised to draw more emphasis to this benefit and to the
issuance of a confirmation number by the Telefile
System.
ETA management has also established a group to
promote awareness and education to internal and
external audiences.  In addition, the IRS periodically
provides articles and Questions and Answers on the 941
TeleFile Program to employees and taxpayers to
improve publicity, education, and instructions for IRS
electronic filing programs.
The IRS has contracted with a vendor to develop a
comprehensive marketing and communications strategy
that will focus on the “941 Suite” of products.  The final
plan “IRS Marketing for Business Masterfile (BMF)
Initiatives” was delivered December 23, 1998.  The plan
gave further direction and provided recommendations
for the best marketing approach for electronic business
options.
The Internal Revenue Service Needs to Provide
Quality Customer Service to TeleFile Users
An effective method for
resolving taxpayer problems is
needed.
The IRS needs to establish a more effective method
for resolving taxpayer problems with the 941
TeleFile Program.  The IRS has not established an
effective method for delivering quality customer service
to taxpayers using the 941 TeleFile Program.  Currently,
business taxpayers with questions about their 941
TeleFile return contact IRS Customer Service.  The
customer service representative then either contacts the
TeleFile Coordinator or has the taxpayer contact the
Coordinator.  We were advised that the TeleFile
Coordinator currently handles about 20 phone calls per
day.
Since this was the first full year of nationwide use, most
of these calls could be handled by the TeleFile
Page 7
The Internal Revenue Service Needs to Encourage Taxpayer Use, Improve
Customer Service, and Enhance Computer Controls of the 941 TeleFile Program
Coordinator. However, the current process does not
meet the IRS’ goal of resolving taxpayers’ problems
during their initial contact with the IRS.  In addition, as
the number of TeleFile users increases, a more effective
method will need to be implemented since TeleFile is
not adequately staffed to handle taxpayer problems.
The IRS is testing an Employment Tax call site for 90
days at the MCC and an employment tax web page on
the Internet.  These two options, if implemented, could
improve the customer service provided to businesses
using the 941 TeleFile Program.
Some current 941 TeleFile
Program users will not be
allowed to use TeleFile for
1999 because their tax
liabilities have exceeded the
dollar threshold, but the IRS
does not inform them of this.
Taxpayers should be informed when they are no
longer eligible to participate in the 941 TeleFile
Program.  The 941 TeleFile Program will not allow
businesses with tax liabilities greater than $50,000 to
use the system because those businesses are required to
file an additional supporting schedule with the Form 941
return.
The IRS uses a taxpayer’s prior filing history to
determine the taxpayer’s requirements for depositing
employment tax payments (known as Federal Tax
Deposits or FTDs) towards their yearly tax liability.
Specifically, the IRS uses the taxpayer’s Form 941 filing
history for 12 months (e.g., beginning July 1st and
ending June 30th of the prior year).  This period is called
the look-back period.  Once the taxpayer’s total tax
liability exceeds $50,000, they are required to deposit
their FTDs on a semi-weekly basis and are also required
to file an Employer’s Record of Federal Tax Liability
(Schedule B), with the Form 941 return.   
When business taxpayers exceed the $50,000 liability
threshold, the IRS issues an Annual Notification of FTD
Deposit Requirements (CP-136 notice), advising them
that their FTD requirements have changed from monthly
to semi-weekly.  However, the notice does not mention
that the taxpayer is no longer eligible to use the
941 TeleFile Program because they exceeded the
threshold.  It also does not indicate that they are now
required to file a Schedule B with the Form 941 return.
Page 8
The Internal Revenue Service Needs to Encourage Taxpayer Use, Improve
Customer Service, and Enhance Computer Controls of the 941 TeleFile Program
Once a taxpayer is required to file a Schedule B, they
cannot file electronically through the Telefile System.
During the first six months of 1998, there were 236,344
filers who attempted to use TeleFile and 8,294 of these
filers were not allowed to use the System because they
were required to file a Schedule B with the Form 941
return.  These Schedule B filers (3.5 percent of the
population) received a CP-136 notice and may have
subsequently called the IRS to determine why they were
no longer eligible to use TeleFile.  These types of calls
could be prevented if the IRS notifies the taxpayer when
they are no longer eligible to use the 941 TeleFile
System.  The IRS could use the CP-136 to advise
taxpayers that they are no longer eligible to use TeleFile
and that they are now required to file a Schedule B with
the Form 941 return.  The notice could also advise the
taxpayer of other alternatives for filing their returns,
such as ELF.
TeleFile packages had not
been updated to reflect the
revised balance due limitation
of $1,000.
The IRS needs to ensure that the 941 TeleFile
Program forms and instructions are timely updated
to reflect program changes.  On October 2, 1998, we
issued a memorandum advising the IRS that the
instructions to the 941 TeleFile package had not been
updated to reflect a revision to the criteria scheduled for
use with the Telefile System in the fourth quarter of
calendar year 1998.  This criteria change involved
permitting taxpayers with a balance due tax liability of
$1,000 or less to use the 941 TeleFile System.  Prior to
this criteria change, taxpayers could only use the 941
TeleFile System if they had a balance due of $500 or
less.
Our review of the fourth quarter TeleFile tax package
instructions and the 941 TeleFile tax form showed that
they had not been revised to reflect that the balance due
criteria of $500 was raised to $1,000.  Line 15 of the
941 TeleFile tax form incorrectly instructed the
taxpayers that if they owed a balance due of $500 or
more, then they could not use the 941 TeleFile System.
This information was also included on Page TEL-1 of
the tax package instructions.
Page 9
The Internal Revenue Service Needs to Encourage Taxpayer Use, Improve
Customer Service, and Enhance Computer Controls of the 941 TeleFile Program
The IRS was expected to mail approximately 3.5 million
fourth quarter TeleFile packages to taxpayers in
December 1998.  The omission to the instructions may
have caused some eligible taxpayers to not use the
941 TeleFile System.  The incorrect instructions may
impact IRS management’s ability to achieve their goal
of 16 million employment tax returns being filed
electronically by the year 2002.
The IRS is currently in the process of enhancing the
941 TeleFile Program to accept all balance due returns
effective January 4, 1999.  This change will eliminate
the balance due dollar restriction.
Recommendations
2. The IRS should ensure that Customer Service
representatives located at Customer Service sites are
adequately trained to handle 941 TeleFile Program
problems.
3. The IRS should provide additional wording to the
CP-136 notice to advise taxpayers they are no longer
eligible to use the 941 TeleFile Program and to
advise them of other electronic alternatives for filing
their returns, such as ELF.
4. In a memorandum dated October 2, 1998, we
recommended that the fourth and subsequent quarter
TeleFile tax packages be revised to correctly instruct
taxpayers on the revised criteria.
Management’s Response: The IRS will supplement
Part 21 of the Internal Revenue Manual (IRM) for
customer service representatives to include additional
program detail and processing instructions when
responding to calls from taxpayers.
The IRS is supplementing
Part 21 of the IRM to include
additional detail and
instructions when responding to
calls from taxpayers, and has
proposed the establishment of an
Employment Tax call site.
The test for the new Employment Tax call site was
conducted between October and December 1998.  Based
on the results of the test, the IRS has proposed the
establishment of the call site.
IRS management has requested a computer code for the
941 TeleFile Program to enable them to track and retain
eligible filers.  Based on Information Systems resources,
Page 10
The Internal Revenue Service Needs to Encourage Taxpayer Use, Improve
Customer Service, and Enhance Computer Controls of the 941 TeleFile Program
the assignment of this code may not be possible until the
year 2001.
The IRS is exploring the
recommendation to include
information about a change in
a taxpayer’s eligibility for the
941 TeleFile Program in the
CP-136 notice.
The IRS will explore the recommendation to include
information in the CP-136 notice that will advise the
taxpayer that if they are required to file a Schedule B,
they are no longer eligible to use the 941 TeleFile
System.  The IRS is also working on incorporating the
Schedule B into the 941 TeleFile System, which is the
basis for the expansion of the 941 TeleFile Program.
The IRS explained that it could not revise the 941
TeleFile tax package prior to mailing the fourth quarter
packages.  The TeleFile instructions and tax package
were subsequently updated and the changes were
effective in the mailout for the first quarter of calendar
year 1999.
The Internal Revenue Service Needs to Improve
941 TeleFile Computer Controls to Prevent
Taxpayers From Filing Multiple Returns and
Allow the System to Verify a TeleFile User's
Filing History and Electronic Signature
Multiple Form 941 TeleFile
returns are being filed.
The 941 TeleFile computer system should prevent the
filing of multiple returns by a taxpayer.  Form 941
TeleFile returns are primarily processed at the TCC.  If
the TCC cannot handle the volume of returns being
filed, or if the Telefile System is not working at TCC,
the CSC serves as the backup site to handle the excess
volume.  The CSC currently accepts TeleFile returns
only during peak filing periods, which are the last two
days of the filing month.  Returns from the two locations
are merged and updated on the 941 TeleFile System at
the end of each day.  In contrast, the IRS’ IMF TeleFile
computer system, which processes Individual Income
Tax Returns (Form 1040), is updated every 15 minutes.
Occasionally, taxpayers file a second, or amended,
return to correct errors or omissions in their original tax
return.  The TeleFile tax package instructions state that
amended returns cannot be filed through TeleFile and
Page 11
The Internal Revenue Service Needs to Encourage Taxpayer Use, Improve
Customer Service, and Enhance Computer Controls of the 941 TeleFile Program
must be filed on paper.  However, if a taxpayer attempts
to file more than one Form 941 TeleFile return in the
same peak filing day, both returns could be processed
separately at the two sites.  Since the Systems are only
merged and updated at the end of the day, TeleFile
would not be aware of the potential duplicate or
amended return and would accept both returns.
However, when there are duplicate returns, TeleFile
always processes the return received at the primary
processing site (TCC).  The return filed at the CSC, the
backup site, would not be processed even though the
taxpayer may have intended otherwise.
Our audit showed that the 941 TeleFile System did not
prevent multiple returns from being filed when both the
TCC and the CSC were receiving TeleFile returns.  We
tested the peak processing period for the second quarter
of calendar year 1998 and identified 17 business
taxpayers that filed more than one 941 return on the
Telefile System.
This process may cause the taxpayer to contact the IRS
to ensure the correct return was processed, which
increases taxpayer burden.  This problem will be
compounded as the volume of both Form 1040 and
Form 941 TeleFile returns increases and there are more
days when both the TCC and the CSC are accepting
TeleFile returns.
Businesses are filing returns
through the 941 TeleFile
System without being
authenticated (i.e., verified) to
use the system.
The IRS could use the look-back period to ensure
businesses using the 941 TeleFile System are
authenticated (i.e., verified) to use the System.  Under
existing processes, business taxpayers can participate in
the 941 TeleFile Program without being authenticated.
Each quarter, the IRS creates a database of taxpayers
who are eligible to use the 941 TeleFile System.  Each
of the taxpayers in the database has been in business for
at least the last 12 months.  Requiring taxpayers to be in
business for at least a year assures the IRS that the 941
TeleFile System is only used by businesses with an
established filing history.  Using the look-back period,
which relies on the Form 941 filing history over the past
year, will provide the IRS with more assurance that
Page 12
The Internal Revenue Service Needs to Encourage Taxpayer Use, Improve
Customer Service, and Enhance Computer Controls of the 941 TeleFile Program
taxpayers have an established filing history when using
the 941 TeleFile System.
To verify the taxpayer’s identity, the IRS requires the
taxpayer to enter the prior year’s third quarter total FTD
amount each time a Form 941 return is filed.  If the
taxpayer did not file a prior year third quarter Form 941
return or have any FTDs for that quarter and enters a
zero in the FTD amount field, the computer allows the
taxpayer to file the current Form 941 return.  As a result,
businesses are able to participate in the Program even
though they have not established a filing history to
determine their filing requirements.
However, it is possible due to timing for an eligible
taxpayer (in business for at least 12 months) to not have
a prior year third quarter FTD amount.  For example,
taxpayers eligible to file for the fourth quarter of 1998
(October 1998 - December 1998) would only have to be
in business since the fourth quarter of calendar year
1997 (October 1997 – December 1997).  These
taxpayers would not have a prior year third quarter FTD
amount because they were not in business during the
third quarter of calendar year 1997.
The IRS should improve the process of verifying the
electronic signatures of the 941 TeleFile System
users.  Currently, taxpayers electronically sign their
returns by entering their Social Security Number (SSN)
and their last name.  After TeleFile accepts the return,
the System provides a confirmation number to the
taxpayer.  The confirmation number is based, in part, on
the date the return is filed.
Because the taxpayer’s electronic signature (name and
SSN) cannot be verified on-line against the IRS’
computer system, a sample of electronic signatures is
manually reviewed at the end of the quarter as a quality
measure.  The TeleFile Coordinator selects a random
sample of returns and manually matches the names and
SSNs to the IRS’ Masterfile to ensure the returns were
filed by the taxpayer or his or her representative.
The TeleFile Coordinator’s review at the end of the
first quarter of calendar year 1998 showed that about
Five percent of the electronic
signatures were not valid.
Page 13
The Internal Revenue Service Needs to Encourage Taxpayer Use, Improve
Customer Service, and Enhance Computer Controls of the 941 TeleFile Program
95 percent of the electronic signatures were valid.  Five
percent of the signatures were not valid because the SSN
did not match the name control.  However, the IRS does
not have procedures to follow up on the invalid
signatures, allowing potential invalid returns to be filed.
This raises the question about the purpose of this quality
review.  If it is important to verify the signature by
manually reviewing a sample of returns, then the IRS
should follow up on the invalid signatures.
Recommendations
5. The IRS should update the 941 TeleFile System
using the same update process used by the IMF
Telefile System.  This process would result in
updates every 15 minutes, which reduces the risk of
multiple returns being filed.
6. The IRS should require taxpayers to be in business
for the entire look-back period to be eligible to
participate in the 941 TeleFile Program.
7. The IRS should assess the risks associated with the
electronic signature process and develop appropriate
actions based on this assessment.  If the IRS elects to
continue the existing process, we recommend that
the IRS determine an acceptable error rate for
invalid signatures and take appropriate action when
the error rate is exceeded.
Management’s Response:  To prevent duplicate returns
from being filed, the IRS has implemented a Data
Replication process to eliminate duplicate returns when
multiple sites are used to process returns .  This process
will be tracked to ensure it is successful.
ETA management will analyze the computer program
criteria for determining if a taxpayer is eligible to use
the 941 TeleFile System to ensure it is capturing eligible
filers for the full look-back period.  ETA management is
also researching the possibility of allowing all new
businesses that otherwise meet the 941 TeleFile
Program requirements to use the System.

Customer Service, and Enhance Computer Controls of the 941 TeleFile Program
The IRS is redesigning the
return filing confirmation
number to make it unique for
each taxpayer.
The IRS is researching a random sample of SSNs for
invalid electronic signatures.  The IRS is sending letters
to the taxpayers who provided the invalid signatures,
and informing them their tax return may be delayed until
the letter is returned with a valid signature.  The IRS is
also working on redesigning the return filing
confirmation number so that it will be unique to each
taxpayer, which will allow the IRS to continue to track
the electronic signature information on a quarterly basis.
The results of the electronic signature information and
an assessment of the error rate will continue to be
reported.
Conclusion
Ninety-four percent of the
businesses that attempted to
use the 941 TeleFile System in
the second quarter of calendar
year 1998 were successful.
Overall, the IRS experienced a successful 1998 filing
season for the 941 TeleFile Program.  Returns were
accurately processed and approximately 94 percent of
the business taxpayers attempting to file electronically
through the 941 TeleFile System were successful.
Improving the marketing and customer service processes
will increase assurances that more of the eligible filers
will use the 941 TeleFile Program in the future.  In
addition, improvements to the 941 TeleFile System will
prevent taxpayers from filing multiple returns and will
improve the process for verifying the filing history and
electronic signatures of taxpayers using the 941 TeleFile
System.

Detailed Objective, Scope, and Methodology
The overall objective of this audit was to evaluate the effectiveness of the Internal Revenue
Service’s (IRS) processes for ensuring that the 1998 941 TeleFile Program was successfully
implemented.   To accomplish the overall objective, we conducted the following tests:
I. 
Evaluated whether the IRS took appropriate actions to address the following
issues identified in the prior review.
A. 
Determined whether taxpayers were adequately identified by selecting a
sample of 50 Employer’s Quarterly Federal Tax Return (Form 941)
TeleFile returns to determine whether the taxpayer had to enter the correct
amount in the security field (total third quarter Federal Tax Deposit
amount from the prior year) before being allowed to file.
B. 
Determined whether only eligible taxpayers filed 941 TeleFile returns.
II. 
Matched the Martinsburg Computing Center requirements for extracting
1998 eligible 941 TeleFile businesses to the 1998 TeleFile package.
III. 
Reviewed 941 TeleFile returns filed for the second quarter of calendar year 1998
to determine whether only eligible businesses filed.
IV. 
Determined the effectiveness of the IRS’ processes for ensuring 941 TeleFile
returns were accurately processed and accounted for during the nationwide
implementation.
A. 
Reviewed a sample of 114 Form 941 TeleFile returns filed for the second
quarter of calendar year 1998 and determined whether taxpayer return
information posted correctly to the Masterfile.
B. 
Tracked the second quarter 941 TeleFile returns from the Tennessee
Computing Center and Cincinnati Service Center Telefile Systems to the
Masterfile.
C. 
Evaluated the IRS’ efforts to verify the electronic signatures (Social
Security Numbers and last name) used to sign the 941 TeleFile returns.
V. 
Assessed publicity efforts for increasing the number of businesses who filed
1998 returns using the 941 TeleFile Program.
A. 
Evaluated the IRS’ efforts to market the 1998 941 TeleFile Program by
reviewing marketing materials and interviewing project office employees.
     Page  16
The Internal Revenue Service Needs to Encourage Taxpayer Use, Improve
Customer Service, and Enhance Computer Controls of the 941 TeleFile Program
B. 
Reviewed the 941 TeleFile Program customer feedback gathered in 1997
and determined whether the IRS had an effective strategy to increase the
number of filers.
C. 
Determined whether the IRS provided adequate information to Customer
Service personnel to enable them to resolve 941 TeleFile Program
problems.

Memorandum #1 - Business Masterfile TeleFile 1998 Expansion
October 2, 1998
MEMORANDUM FOR NATIONAL DIRECTOR
TAX FORMS AND PUBLICATIONS DIVISION OP:FS:FP
FROM:
(for) REGIONAL INSPECTOR
SOUTHEAST REGION 
SUBJECT:
BMF TeleFile 1998 Expansion – Internal Audit Memorandum #1
This memorandum is to advise you of an error in the fourth quarter 941 TeleFile
Instructions that may adversely effect the number of taxpayers participating in the BMF
TeleFile program. Although Internal Revenue Manual 1289 provides 30 workdays for
responding to an Internal Audit memorandum, we are requesting that you advise us of the
action you plan take in a written response within 10 workdays.  This request is being
made as a result of the time sensitivity of the issue.  If you have any suggestions for
improving or clarifying this memorandum, please contact me or Audit Manager Jim
Westcott at (606) 292-5162.
Instructions to the BMF TeleFile package have not been updated to reflect program
enhancements scheduled for the Telefile System in the fourth quarter.
We determined that the 941 TeleFile Tax packages have not been revised to show that the
$500 balance due limit is no longer in effect. The Service is in the process of enhancing
the BMF TeleFile program to accept all balance due returns effective January 4, 1999.
This change will eliminate the restriction for taxpayers who owe a balance due of $500 or
more. Previously, if a taxpayer attempted to file and had a balance due of $500 or more
they would receive a message indicating that their balance due exceeded the balance due
amount that TeleFile can accept and that the Service cannot continue with the processing
of their return.  Furthermore, taxpayers would be advised to file a paper return for the
quarter.
Our review showed that the TeleFile package instructions and the 941 TeleFile Tax
Record have not been revised to eliminate the balance due criteria of $500 or more.  Line
15 of the 941 TeleFile Tax Record incorrectly tells the taxpayer that if they owe a balance
due of $500 or more, they cannot use 941 TeleFile.  This information is also included on
Page TEL-1 of the tax package instructions.  Modifications to the 941 TeleFile Program
for the fourth quarter eliminated the restriction of taxpayers who owe a balance due of
     Page  20
The Internal Revenue Service Needs to Encourage Taxpayer Use, Improve
Customer Service, and Enhance Computer Controls of the 941 TeleFile Program
$500 or more.  The BMF TeleFile packages are scheduled to be mailed in December
1998, for the fourth quarter.
This oversight to the instructions will cause taxpayers not to use the BMF TeleFile
program. We estimate the Service plans to mail approximately 3.4 million 941TeleFile
packages for the fourth quarter. With the emphasis on customer service and on increasing
the number of taxpayers filing returns electronically, the Service cannot afford to
overlook issues that may impact these goals.
Recommendation
To minimize losing potential taxpayers that are eligible to file 941 TeleFile, we
recommend that the fourth and subsequent quarter TeleFile tax packages, including the
941 TeleFile Tax Record line 15, be revised by removing the reference to the $500
balance due.
