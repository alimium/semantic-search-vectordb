2009 impacts: THE ExPaNDED FOOD  
aND NUTRITION EDUcaTION PROGRaM (EFNEP)
DEFINING THE PROBLEM
ince 1969, EFNEP has improved  
the diets and food-related behaviors 
of program participants. Each year  
S
Obesity, poor nutrition, and limited physical activity are 
significant health concerns. Poor health disproportionately 
affects minority and low-income populations. Educational 
opportunities and resources are limited.
INVESTING IN THE SOLUTION
EFNEP enrolls more than half a million 
new program participants. In 2009, EFNEP 
reached 147,043 adults and 444,875  
youth directly and nearly 400,000 family 
members indirectly.
EFNEP brings together federal, state, and local resources 
to target two primary audiences: low-income families with 
young children and low-income youth. The program oper-
ates in over 800 counties throughout the 50 states, 6 U.S. 
territories, and the District of Columbia. Each year, more 
than 500,000 new participants complete the program.

“ You assume that people know how to eat 
and  that people will just cook to meet 
those needs; unfortunately, nutrition is 
something that does have to be taught. For 
a community to be able to have a program 
like this… it’s certainly more valuable than  
I think anyone really understands.”
“ [EFNEP is] a tool that families and individu-
als can use to better their lives … because 
when people ... learn together and cook 
together it sets off the first spark that’s 
needed for education to spread. EFNEP is 
the spark that’s needed in people’s lives 
and in communities.”
“ If we teach people how to better shop  
for food and what to do with food… it helps  
decrease the number of people who  
go back to food pantries for assistance. 
It helps break that cycle of dependency…  
it’s an answer to help people in these  
economically troubling times.”
