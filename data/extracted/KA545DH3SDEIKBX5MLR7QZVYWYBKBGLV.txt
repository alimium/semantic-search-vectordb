Drug Deaths 
38,371 people died of drug-induced causes in 2007, the latest year for which data are available.  The number of 
drug-induced deaths has grown from 19,128 in 1999, or from 6.8 deaths per 100,000 population to 12.6 in 2007.1 
 
   
(These include causes directly involving drugs, such as accidental poisoning or overdoses, but do not include 
accidents, homicides, AIDS, and other causes indirectly related to drugs.)  
There is a drug-induced death in the U.S. every 15 minutes.2 
 
 
 
 
 
Compared to other causes of preventable deaths, drug-induced causes exceeded the 31,224 deaths from injuries 
due to firearms and the 23,199 alcohol-induced deaths recorded in 2007.  In the same year, 34,598 deaths were 
classified as suicides and 18,361 deaths as homicides.3 
 
Drugged Driving 
From a national roadside survey in 2007, one in eight (12.4%) of weekend nighttime drivers tested positive for at 
least one illicit drug.4 
Based on a self-report survey in 2009, approximately 10.5 million Americans reported driving under the influence 
of an illicit drug during the past year.5 
In 2009, one in three drivers killed in motor vehicle crashes who were tested for drugs and the results known, 
tested positive for at least one medication or illicit drug.6 
Among high school seniors in 2008, one in 10 (10.4%) reported that in the two weeks prior to their interview, 
they had driven a vehicle after smoking marijuana.7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Children 
 
Annual averages for 2002 to 2007 indicate that over 8.3 million youth under 18 years of age, or almost one in 
eight youth (11.9%), lived with at least one parent who was dependent on alcohol or an illicit drug in the past 
year.8  Of these, About 2.1 million youth lived with a parent who was dependent on or abused illicit drugs, and 
almost 7.3 million lived with a parent who was dependent on or abused alcohol.9 
 
 
School Performance 
Significantly fewer youth in school who are current marijuana users report an average grade of “A” (12.5%) 
compared to those who are not current marijuana users (30.5% report an average grade of “A”).10 
 
 
 
 
College students who use prescription stimulant medications nonmedically typically have lower grade point 
averages, are more likely to be heavy drinkers and users of other illicit drugs, and are more likely to meet 
diagnostic criteria for dependence on alcohol and marijuana, skip class more frequently, and spend less time 
studying. 11 
 
 
Economic Costs 
 
The economic cost of drug abuse in the US was estimated at $180.9 billion in 2002, the last available estimate.  
This value represents both the use of resources to address health and crime consequences as well as the loss of 
potential productivity from disability, premature death, and withdrawal from the legitimate workforce.12

Addiction and Treatment Need 
 
In 2009, 23.5 million persons aged 12 or older needed treatment for an illicit drug or alcohol use problem (9.3 
percent of persons in that age group).  Of these, 7.1 million persons needed treatment for illicit drug problems, 
with or without alcohol.13 
Of the 23.5 million persons needing substance use treatment, 2.6 million received treatment at a specialty facility 
in the past year, and of the 7.1 million needing drug treatment, 1.5 million received specialty treatment.14 
 
 
 
 
Acute Health Effects 
 
 
In 2008, an estimated 2 million visits to emergency departments in US hospitals were associated with drug misuse 
or abuse, including close to one million (993,379) visits involving an illicit drug.  Nonmedical use of 
pharmaceuticals was involved in 971,914 visits.15 Cocaine was involved in 482,188 visits, marijuana was 
involved in 374,435 visits, heroin was involved in 200,666 visits, and stimulants (including amphetamines and 
methamphetamine) were involved in 91,939 visits.  
Criminal Justice Involvement 
 
 
 
According to a 2009 study of arrestees in 10 major metropolitan areas across the country, drug use among the 
arrestee population is much higher than in the general U.S. population.  The percentage of booked arrestees 
testing positive for at least one illicit drug ranged from 56 percent to 82 percent.  The most common substances 
present during tests, in descending order, are marijuana, cocaine, opiates (primarily metabolites of heroin or 
morphine), and methamphetamine.  Many arrestees tested positive for more than one illegal drug at the time of 
arrest.16 
According to a 2004 survey of inmates in correctional facilities, 32 percent of state inmates and 26 percent of 
federal prisoners reported that they used drugs at the time of the offense.17 
   
 
 
Environmental Impact and Dangers 
 
 
 
There are significant environmental impacts from clandestine methamphetamine drug labs, including chemical 
toxicity, risk of fire and explosion, lingering effects of toxic waste, and potential injuries. The number of domestic 
meth lab incidents, which includes dumpsites, active labs, and chemical/glassware set-ups, dropped dramatically 
in response to the Combat Meth Epidemic Act, (CMEA) of 2005, from nearly 13,000 in 2005 to just over 6,000 in 
2007. However, traffickers are devising methods to avoid the CMEA restrictions and domestic meth lab incidents 
are rising again, reaching 9,800 in 2009.18 
 
 
Coca and poppy cultivation in the Andean jungle is significantly damaging the environment in the region.  The 
primary threats to the environment are deforestation caused by clearing the fields for cultivation, soil erosion, and 
chemical pollution from insecticides and fertilizers.  Additionally, the lab process of converting coca and poppy 
into cocaine and heroin has adverse effects on the environment.19 
 
 
 
Mexican drug trafficking organizations have been operating on public lands in the U.S.  to cultivate marijuana, 
with serious consequences for the environment and public safety. Propane tanks and other trash from illicit 
marijuana growers litter the remote areas of park lands from California to Tennessee. Growers often use a cocktail 
of pesticides and fertilizers many times stronger than what is used on residential lawns to cultivate their crop. 
These chemicals leach out quickly, killing native insects and other organisms directly.  Fertilizer runoff 
contaminates local waterways and aids in the growth of algae and weeds. The aquatic vegetation in turn impedes 
water flows that are critical to maintaining biodiversity in wetlands and other sensitive environments.20
