DEBRA KAY HICKS and JAMES 
LLOYD HICKS, 
 
                          Debtors.   
10 
 
THIS MATTER came before the court on the Trustee’s Motion to Dismiss for 
11 
Failure to Timely File Documents (ECF No. 31). The court reviewed the files and 
12 
records herein, heard argument of counsel, is fully advised in the premises, and 
13 
enters findings of fact and conclusions of law, and an order. 
14 
FINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW 
15 
1. 
The debtors filed a chapter 13 bankruptcy petition on April 23, 2014 
16 
(ECF No. 1 at pp. 1-3). 
17 
2. 
Together with the debtors’ bankruptcy petition, the debtors filed 
18 
schedules, a Statement of Financial Affairs, and a Chapter 13 Statement of Current 
19 
Monthly Income (ECF No. 1 at pp. 34, 42 and 60). Each of these documents were

1 
verified by the debtors as true and correct in accordance with Fed. R. Bankr. P. 
2 
1008. 
3 
3. 
In the debtors’ schedules, they verified that both of them were 
4 
unemployed and that Debra Kay Hicks is disabled (ECF No. 1 at p. 30). 
5 
4. 
In the debtors’ Statement of Financial Affairs, they verified that during 
6 
the two years prior to filing their bankruptcy petition that the only income they 
7 
received “from employment, trade, or profession, or from operation of the debtor’s 
8 
business” was $7,352.94 that James Lloyd Hicks received from AMR Ambulance 
9 
Service in 2012 (ECF No. 1 at p. 35). 
10 
5. 
In their Chapter 13 Statement of Current Monthly Income, the debtors 
11 
verified that they received no income from “wages, salary, tips, bonuses, overtime, 
12 
[or] commissions” during the six (6) month period preceding the petition date (ECF 
13 
No. 1 at p. 54).  
14 
6. 
The debtors have no payment advices to file because the only income 
15 
they received from employment, trade, a profession, or the operation of a business 
16 
was more than sixty (60) days prior to the filing of their bankruptcy petition. 
17 
7. 
On June 5, 2014, the Chapter 13 Trustee (the “trustee”) filed a motion 
18 
in which he requested that the court dismiss the debtors’ bankruptcy case as a result 
19 
of the debtors’ failure to timely file “Payment Advices and/or Declaration re: Lack 
20 
of Payment Advices” (ECF No. 31). The trustee asserted in his motion that the relief

1 
requested was “pursuant to FRBP 1007(c) and/or FRBP 3015 and 11 U.S.C. 
2 
§521(a).” 
3 
8. 
On June 11, 2014, the debtors’ counsel filed an objection to the 
4 
trustee’s motion to dismiss (ECF No. 36). In the objection the debtors’ counsel 
5 
stated: 
6 
7 
8 
9 
The debtors received no payment advices of the kind described in and 
required to be filed under 11 U.S.C. § 521(a). Contrary to the trustee’s 
assertion, there is no requirement that debtors file a declaration regarding 
the lack of such payment advices under the statute, Federal Bankruptcy 
Rules, or Local Bankruptcy Rules. 
 
9. 
The debtors’ schedules, Statement of Financial Affairs, and Chapter 13 
10 
Statement of Current Monthly Income each provide statements that are verified 
11 
pursuant to Fed. R. Bankr. P. 1008 and provide evidence that there are no payment 
12 
advices that need to be filed in this case. 
13 
10. 
On June 18, 2014, the trustee filed a response to the debtors’ objection 
14 
(ECF No. 41). In the response, the trustee cited 11 U.S.C. § 521(a)(1)(B)(iv) for the 
15 
proposition that the debtors are required to file copies of payment advices; however, 
16 
the trustee cited no code section, rule, or other authority for the proposition that a 
17 
debtor is required to file a declaration where there are no payment advices available 
18 
for filing. 
19 
11. 
On June 24, 2014, the trustee filed a report that there were no objections 
20 
to confirmation of the debtors’ chapter 13 plan, and in that report the trustee

1 
recommended that the debtors’ plan be confirmed because it satisfies the 
2 
requirements of the Bankruptcy Code (ECF No. 45).  
3 
12. 
On June 25, 2014, the debtors’ plan was confirmed (ECF No. 51). 
4 
 
13. 
On July 28, 2014, the trustee filed a supplemental reply in support of 
5 
his motion to dismiss the debtors’ case (ECF No. 55). In the supplemental reply, the 
6 
trustee asserted for the first time that the debtors are required by Fed. R. Bankr. P. 
7 
4002(b)(2) to provide a written statement that payment advices do not exist or are 
8 
not in the debtors’ possession. 
9 
 
14. 
In the supplemental reply, the trustee quotes the Advisory Committee 
10 
Notes to the 2008 amendments to Fed. R. Bankr. P. 4002(b)(2) to support the 
11 
assertion that debtors are required to cooperate and provide the requested 
12 
documents; however, the quoted paragraph also provides: 
13 
14 
15 
Subdivision (b)(2) does not require that the debtor create documents or 
obtain documents from third parties; rather, the debtor's obligation is to 
bring to the meeting of creditors under §341 the documents which the 
debtor possesses.  
 
 
16 
 
15. 
The continuation of the trustee’s effort to dismiss the debtors’ case is 
17 
inconsistent with the trustee’s recommendation that the debtors’ plan be confirmed.
18 
 
16. 
The debtors have satisfied all of their reporting obligations with respect 
19 
to payment advices.
