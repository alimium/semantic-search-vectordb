ABSTRACT
These two newsletter issues focus on training
strategies for developing more inclusive programs for children with
disabilities and for developing collaborative programs.
An interview
with Dr. Barbara Wolfe addresses successful inservice teacher
training strategies. Additional information in the first issue
includes guidelines for empowering parents to participate in
inclusion training (based on the Partnerships for Inclusion Project,
North Carolina) and suggestions for involving-the community, (based
on the Community Connections Project, Washington, D.C.). The second
issue has a brief article on the importance of building a common
vision for successful collaboration,
interpersonal skills and
collaboration (based on the Meeting House Cooperative Preschool,
Alexandria, Virginia), developing collaborative organizations (based
on the Inclusion through Transdisciplinary Team Project in
Idaho),
and developing inclusive communities for young children with
disabilities (based on the Welcome Everywhere Project in Indiana).

SPOTLIGHT ON TRAINING STRATEGIES
FOLLOW-UP: A KEY COMPONENT OF SUCCESSFUL TRAINING
someone else demonstrating the new idea, (2) having on-
the-job assistance or (3) participating in small group
discussions with fellow staff or an administrator.
Dr. Barbara Wolfe, a trainer-of-trainers exemplar,
is currently on the faculty of the Department of
Special Education at the University of Wiscon-
sin-Eau Claire. Prior to university teaching, she spent
fifteen years providing inservice training on inclusion to
early childhood professionals. We would like to share some
of Barbara's thoughts on training gleaned from a recent
telephone interview.
You have conducted research on best practices in
inservice education. What did you find most helped
teachers implement new ideas in their classrooms?
Two other specific follow-up strategies that can be
offered to participants on a voluntary basis are: (1) coach-
ing (peer or expert coaching) which is a labor intensive,
one-on-one strategy where the coach serves as a mirror
through which the teacher can examine her behavior, and
(2) peer support group which brings participants back
together to talk about the successes they have experienced
and to brainstorm solutions that support implementation
efforts.
Earlier you spoke of "back home" plans as a follow-
up strategy. Can you expand on that?
Factors that most helped teachers use new ideas in their
classroom were (1) useful handouts/materials, (2) relevant
content that addressed an existing need. (3) follow-up
support, (4) practical content that could be applied immedi-
ately and (5) an effective trainer.
A "back home" plan is like a personal learning plan. It
is a good strategy for intensive full-day or multi-day
classes. Each individual completes a plan indicating
personal goals, what they will do to accomplish their goals,
and possibly, products that will demonstrate accomplish-
ment. Trainers can get feedback on the participants'
progress toward their goals by doing follow-up visits,
calling the site, or requesting video or written records.
Did any of these findings surprise you?
Two were surprisingthe importance of handouts (i.e.
practical. relevant handouts) and the impact of the trainer
on inservice outcomes. Participants defined effective
trainers as knowledgeable, well prepared, credible, enthusi-
astic and able to use a variety of techniques including
hands-on and interactive strategies. The good news about
these characteristics is that people can learn themthat is.
training isn't an inherent trait but rather a learned skill.
Let's talk for a minute about follow-up support. Could
you define what you mean by follow-up?
It is sometimes difficult to motivate participants to
complete a back home plan after a long training day, so I
have tried using an "Aha" sheet where participants write
down new ideas throughout the session. Then when they
make their plan, I have them limit their ideas to 3 or 4
things to try at home. We usually take up to a half-hour at
the end of the training course to develop an individual or
team "back home" plan. Carry-over is sometimes increased
by having participants verbally report their plan to someone
else, or to the whole group. Somehow when you say it
aloud, you feel more committed to action.
Broadly speaking, follow-up can be defined as strate-
gies and events that take place following the planned
workshop experience. Some examples are a "back home"
plan to try on the job, a follow-up class or workshop, on-
site coaching by peers or trainers or a follow-up letter with
resource articles.
Why do you think follow-up is so important in
inservice education?
Learning is a process, not something that happens in a
one-time training event. Change takes place over time and
requires a focused effort for new ideas to be integrated into
ongoing practice. Follow-up provides a strategy for focused
effort over time, thereby increasing the chance that new
ideas will actually become on-the-job behaviors.
Is there anything else you would like to say?
Helping teachers learn new skills and incorporate them
into the classroom requires an intensive system of training
that utilizes multiple training strategies, including opportu-
nities to observe, practice, receive feedback and talk about
the ideas. It is paramount that administrators are committed
to both the ideas being presented and the training design,
which might require an increase in release time for training,
planning or peer support.

effective?

EMPOWERING PARENTS TO PARTICIPATE IN INCLUSION TRAINING
Arecent North
Carolina project
trained parents of
children with disabilities to
serve as inclusion specialists
advocates. At these sessions, each parent trainee give a
presentation. The other trainees and the parent-advocate
acted as an audience of professionals who critiqued each
presentation. This role playing helped prepare the
trainees to present information before live audiences and
to answer probing questions. The inclusion specialists
now serve to link the parents to day care and related
training programs across North Carolina.

participating in
inclusion training for
day care and other providers of services to children. This
training, designed and conducted primarily by experi-
enced parent advocates, was funded by the Partnerships
for Inclusion Project at the Frank Porter Graham Child
Development Center at the University of North Carolina
Chapel Hill.
GIVING THE HELP THAT TH
The parents participating in the project represented a
variety of socio-economic and family backgrounds, had
children with different disabilities, and were located
throughout the state. The parents agreed to participate in
a two-day training session and follow-up activities.
Expenses and a small honorarium were given to partici-
pants.
The training sessions and follow-up activities were
designed to develop the participants' advocacy and
presentation skills by focusing on the following:
a working knowledge of the state's service delivery
system;
the ability to effectively present a personalized
rationale for inclusion;
a working knowledge of the basic rights of children
with disabilities;
In 1981, the
Social Integra-
tion Program
(SIP), which was
administered at Utah
State University,
began to serve
children with disabili-
ties in community-
based child care
centers. Its positive
results for children,
families and providers have led to subsequent projects to
assist preschool personnel in serving children with
disabilities. One of the biggest challenges facing com-
munity program inclusion efforts is providing the help
that is needed when it is needed. Although training
typically addresses many of the providers' anticipated
needs, unanticipated needs inevitably arise as services
are delivered to children and families.
To respond to providers' needs in a timely manner,
we have found no substitute for "being there." When
someone with special expertise in serving children with
disabilities and their families is present on a daily basis,
she/he can most easily develop the working relationships
necessary to help teams provide effective services.
the ability to work effectively within the system in
advocating for inclusion.
Several of the sessions focused on giving parents a
variety of "tools" to present their unique perspective on
inclusion. Topics included incorporating humor,
children's books and artwork, visual images and adult
education principles to support presentations. Adult
learning principles included giving audiences informa-
tion they could use (relevance), showing how the
information could be used to solve problems (practical-
ity) and convincing audiences of the need to learn
(motivation).
Although on-site support is our preferred form of
technical assistance, we must often seek alternatives due
to factors such as time and distance. After a good
working relationship has been established, an itinerant
person can offer assistance using telecommunication
The parents left the two-day training with an "indi-
vidualized education plan" to help develop their presen-
tations. This written plan outlined the presentation
pieces that were in place, i.e., the "strengths," and the
pieces that needed to be developed, i.e., the "needs." As
follow up, smaller groups met with one of the parent

teams of child care providers
who then support the inclusion of
children with disabilities in their

on the belief that all children with disabilities deserve
the option of attending community programs with their:

care personnel in their collaboration with other service
providers to meet the needs of all children in inclusive
As training begins, the first
issue addressed is the partici-
pants' attitudes and values
about disabilities. Addressing
attitudes and values first gives
participants the opportunity to
talk about their fears and
hopes, Trainees are asked to think about inclusion from
a personal perspective by remembering and describing a
time in their lives when they wanted to belong and felt
excluded. People describe powerful childhood memories
about being ridiculed in kindergarten, being excluded
from a team, and/or being teased about their ethnicity.
Through this exercise they remember the hurt of exclu-
sion and they begin to empathize with the feelings of
children in their care.
NEED WHEN THEY NEED IT
Next, participants complete a survey that asks them
to rate their responses to a series of statements about
inclusion such as:
E3 The parents of a child with disabilities should be able
to decide what placement and services their child
receives.
options such as the telephone. For example, during
a weekly phone call to each site, the SIP consultant
and provider reviewed each child's progress and
together sought solutions to problems.
O For most children with disabilities inclusion works
only if there is extra adult help.
CI Inclusion is good for children with disabilities but the
other children usually do not benefit.
E3
Teaching children with disabilities is much harder than
teaching typical children.
O Some children would be better off in separate more
specialized settings.
But sometimes a picture is needed to establish
the context in which the problem occurs. Two
strategies have proven advantageous in this situa-
tion. One is to "dialogue" through a videotape
exchange. First, the provider makes a video demon-
strating the problem and then the trainer responds
by making a video that demonstrates an alternative
practice. In the Early Ed Project, video exchange
helped providers increase child engagement in
small group activities by demonstrating alternative
strategies for child-adult interactions.
The group then discusses the range of responses. Be-
cause there are no right or wrong answers, this exercise
helps people clarify their own values and beliefs and
share their thinking with their colleagues. Teaming is
vital to the success of inclusion and this exercise also
helps the trainees understand and respect the values and
beliefs of their team members.
By working through this process of examining and
experiencing the power of attitudes and values about
disabilities, the teams come to a common core of beliefs
about inclusion. Team members then write a mission
statement that will serve to guide their goals and activi-
ties as they plan for inclusion.

Another strategy, interactive television, allows
all parties to see what is happening as well as to
talk about it. Using the state's educational televi-
sion network, a speech and language pathologist in
a television studio watched two children in pre-
schools several hundred miles away. She gave the
providers suggestions to stimulate language and
then followed up weekly through videotape ex-
change. These alternatives allow us to deliver
personalized help in a timely manner without
spending hours traveling from program to program.

SPOTLIGHT ON COLLABORATION
BUILDING A VISION FOR COLLABORATION
small successes. Collaboration is basically a people-to-
people process. It is essential to create strong bonds and
mutual respect between the collaborative partners as a
first step in building a shared vision.
Creating a meaningful vision is an exciting and
challenging task. To effectively sustain the commitment
of the collaborative partners to change, a shared vision
must include the deeply personal visions of each
participant as well as mutually held beliefs. When this
happens, a vision will be seen as both "my vision" and
"our vision" (Senge, 1990). Rowe (1992), developer of a
vision-driven, decision-making model for school
restructunng, suggests that change requires visions that
(1) are compelling, (2) are clear and (3) can be assessed.
"We will send a man to the moon in this decade" is a
As communities strive to increase inclusive
options in early childhood education, the need
to pull together fragmented systems has raised
new issues for planners and practitioners. Rejoining a
fragmented system is not an easy task. Typically, a
community may begin by establishing an interagency
group with the mission of coordinating services to
families. This type of cooperative initiative simply
coordinates existing services and offers a reasonable
starting point for change. However, in localities where
the need and intent is to fundamentally change the ways
services are designed and delivered, a
collaborative strategy will be necessary
(Melaville and Blank, 1991). Whether a
partnership will be collaborative or coopera-
tive in nature depends on "how far partners
wish to move beyond the status quo"
(Melaville and Blank, 1991).
classic statement of a vision that exemplifies
these criteria. So too are the visions "all
children can learn" or "all children can learn
in school environments that are fully
inclusive." Shared vision statements
such as these can change the way a
school system does business.
Collaboration is a process: it is not an end in itself.
A collaborative effort will look different each time it is
implemented. A specific model of collaboration cannot
be "parachuted" into a state, community or classroom. It
must be responsive to the culture of each new location
(Blank and Lombardi, 1991). Collaborations are
relationship-oriented and like all lasting relationships
take time to develop.

organization. New York: Doubleday/Currency
The existence of a common goal or
vision supports the notion of fundamental
change and is a defining feature of a true
collaboration. A shared vision requires
that collaborating parties express their personal beliefs
and build consensus around the issue they wish to
address. Participants in this process are challenged to
transcend their traditional roles and answer the question
"What do we want to create?" rather than "What do we
think we can do?". As service delivery barriers are
broken down, there is an opportunity to create an
inclusive vision and to have a collaboration where the
whole becomes greater than the sum of the parts. Senge
(1990) in his book The Fifth Discipline, states that a
shared vision can "create the spark, the excitement that
lifts an organization out of the mundane, . .. compel
courage so naturally that people don't even realize the
extent of their courage. .
. foster risk taking and
experimentation."

Collaboration may not always start with a clear
vision, but rather begin with a sense that something
needs to happen differently. The vision may not be
clearly articulated for some time. Vandercook, York
and Sullivan (1993) warn that engaging in a long-term
commitment without taking the time to build relation-
ships can be futile. Collaborations are fostered by
encouraging participants to work together on small
projects: offering opportunities to share philosophies,

COLLABORATION:
An Interpersonal Effort
Establishing communication, remaining flexible and

a shared vision and meet the challenges the inclusion
program presents.

Meeting House Cooperative Preschool

Alexandria, VA 22314
Meeting House Cooperative Preschool is a
private community preschool in Alexandria,
Virginia. Since 1991, the school, in
collaboration with the Alexandria City Public Schools,
has offered inclusive placements for children with
disabilities. These children and their teachers are
provided support by a special educator from the
school system, who is on site at least two days per
week. Partnerships between the regular and special
educators require a variety of skills. In particular,
three interpersonal skills have facilitated
collaboration: communication, flexibility and
support.
DEVELOPING COLLA:.
To Promote Inc
Building rapport is an essential first step in
establishing good communication. At Meeting House,
initial meetings between the regular and special
educators focused on sharing vital information (e.g.,
curriculum, IEPs) and clarifying expectations.
Occasionally forms (e.g., role exchange form) were
used to expedite these discussions. In addition, team
members worked to develop a personal relationship.
Limited free time was used to engage in casual
conversations about ideas and concerns, helping to
strengthen rapport.
Source Of Resistance
community teams
No .perceived benefit
Fear of incapability
The Inclusion through
Transdisciplinary Team
project (ITT) at the
University of Idaho provides
technical assistance to
communities of professionals
and parents who strive to
promote inclusive lives for
all young children. Examples
of
include Interagency
Council Committees, Head Start
regional offices, and state departments
of education. ITT's organizational
approach to inclusion emphasizes the
collaboration of persons representing
different disciplines. A major
characteristic of these teams is the
wide range of perspectives toward
inclusion by its members.
Anxiety over uncertain
outcomes
Teamwork requires flexibility in both principles
and practices. Regular and special educators often
view issues that arise in inclusive programs from
distinct perspectives. Being willing to reflect on
differences and remain open to adapting one's
practices helps to create a team approach. In one
Meeting House class, a child with disabilities was
having extreme difficulty during circle time. While the
classroom teacher did not want this child to be
separated, she agreed to the special educator's plan to
pull the child out of circle time. The time was used to
facilitate skills the child needed to participate in group
time and eventually he was able to join in circle time.
Fear of budget loss or
salary change
Fear of lost
responsibility or
authority
Working with a diverse group of
persons presents both opportunities
and challenges. Collaborative efforts
are more effective than individual
efforts. However, members' resistance
to change often impedes
collaboration. Commonly encountered
sources of resistance and strategies for
overcoming them are listed in Figure
1 at right.
We often facilitate team collaboration by having
members learn and appreciate each other's views.
Nonproductive arguing endangers relationships. By
helping people to understand other perspectives, we
remove sources of argument. We do this through a five-
step process.
Support among team members is a basic
ingredient in successful collaborations. When there
are problems to be solved, they are tackled together
with each member contributing ideas and resources. In
order to recognize problems as well as progress, goals
must be defined. Goals may reflect objectives for
children or next steps necessary for team
development. With goals firmly in mind, the
challenges can be identified and addressed, and the
small steps made toward improvement can be
perceived and acknowledged.

Inclusive Communities for Young Children
Innovative Practices for Young Children at the University
Affiliated Program of Indiana.
Welcome Everywhere: Inclusive Communities for
Young Children with Disabilities is a project
designed to facilitate collaborative relationships
and networks that result in inclusive programs and activities
throughout communities. The Welcome Everywhere project
supports building local capacity for inclusion through (1)
administrative commitment, (2) involvement of a variety of
stakeholders and (3) the availability of training and technical
assistance. The project is conducted by the Center for
ORATIVE ORGANIZATIONS
lusive Communities
A major goal of the project is to promote inclusion in
education and non-education settings throughout a
community. This goal has prompted a unique aspect of the
projectthe establishment of local Inclusion Networks.
An Inclusion Network is comprised of citizens represent-
ing a variety of organizations reflecting each community's
unique strengths and resources. Network membership
usually includes parents, educators, health professionals,
social service providers, clergy, business persons and local
government officials. The Inclusion Network meets over a
period of twelve to eighteen months (four or five meet-
ings) to carry out the following project-related activities:
the development of a Community Vision Statement
the identification of Issues and Barriers to inclusion
the development of Action Plans to address issues and
barriers
the identification of agencies and individuals to receive
Inclusion Network information
Specific formats, tailored to individual communities, are
followed to facilitate the activities.
Prepare for developing the team: Members learn as much as
possible about each other, including their perceptions. Ways to
do this include assuming each others' positions; active
listening exercises; role playing; and sharing perceived
strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and barriers in regard to
efforts toward inclusion.
Set the tone for the team: Identify interests common to all
members through focus groups.
Define the team's purpose: Focus on common interests and
Strategies
Increase knowledge
Involve in planning
Offer financial support
The success of the Inclusion Networks has been
attributed to several factors, including the opportunity to
work with a broad coalition of community members; the
opportunity to consider new and different ways to address
issues and barriers; and productive, fast paced meetings.
As one participant noted, "It is a unique opportunity to
expand views and promote change-attitudes about children
with disabilities and their families can be dramatically
altered and gaps can be filled. [It provided] a much needed
forum for awareness."

mutual concerns, not solutions. One way
to do this is by developing a mission
statement.
Generate options: Create several options
while avoiding obstacles such as premature
judgment or belief in a single solution. At
this time, goals should be formalized and
prioritized.
Evaluate options and reach consensus:
Establish criteria for making decisions and
initiate development of action plans.
We view team operations as a series of
sequences that occur within the contexts of
team development and crisis response.
These are (1) team formation, (2) storming
(exploring different perspectives), (3) setting
team behavior norms, and (4) performance.
Finally, we believe that some conflict is
good, as it helps to facilitate team action.
Adjust role expectations

The function and outcomes of Inclusion Networks
differ from formal networks such as local interagency
coordinating councils. By combining existing local
associations and informal/formal networks associated with
early childhood special education programs and agencies,
Inclusion Networks have established and promoted
inclusive practices across communities. The activities of
each Network seem to have a ripple effect. Members
indicate they share information with other people in the
community. Those members, representing businesses and
community organizations, have reported changes made in
their practices to ensure the inclusion of children with
disabilities and their families.
