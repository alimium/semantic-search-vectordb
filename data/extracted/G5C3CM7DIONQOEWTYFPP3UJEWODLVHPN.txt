Student Lending 
Introduction > Background 
Introduction 
 
Background 
 
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency’s (OCC) Comptroller’s Handbook booklet, 
“Student Lending,” is prepared for use by OCC examiners in connection with their 
examination and supervision of national banks and federal savings associations (collectively, 
banks). Each bank is different and may present specific issues. Accordingly, examiners 
should apply the information in this booklet consistent with each bank’s individual 
circumstances. When it is necessary to distinguish between them, national banks and federal 
savings associations (FSA) are referred to separately. 
 
This booklet focuses on private student lending. Information regarding federal student loans 
is included as industry background, for historical context, and to highlight differences 
between federal student loans and private student loans. This booklet discusses how banks 
may legally and prudently engage in private student lending and the risks inherent in such 
lending; provides information on unique aspects of private student loans and industry 
practices; and includes private student lending product information, the processes involved in 
lending and risk management functions, and regulatory expectations for safe and sound 
operations. 
 
The booklet provides additional notes on guaranteed rehabilitated student loans, a pool of 
loans that a small number of OCC-regulated community and midsize banks have shown 
interest in and have added to their balance sheets. 
 
Regulatory Considerations 
 
The regulatory considerations for national banks and FSAs are discussed throughout this 
booklet. One notable consideration for FSAs, which does not apply to national banks, is 
section 5(c)(1)(U) of the Home Owners’ Loan Act.1 This statute allows FSAs to invest in, 
sell, or otherwise deal in loans and other investments made for the payment of educational 
expenses without any limit on the aggregate amount of such loans. 
 
General Information 
 
The student lending market began with the passage of the Higher Education Act of 1965 
(HEA).2 This federal law governs the administration of federal student aid programs that 
provide financial assistance to students in postsecondary and higher education. Title IV of the 
HEA, which covers “financial assistance for students,” authorized the federal guaranteed 
student loan program. The law was intended to strengthen the educational resources of 
colleges and universities and to provide financial assistance for students in postsecondary and 
                                                           
1 Refer to 12 USC 1464(c)(1)(U), “Federal Savings Associations: Loans or Investments Without Percentage of 
Assets Limitation: Educational Loans,” and generally 12 USC 1461 et seq. 
 
2 Refer to Public Law 89-329, 79 Stat 1219 (1965) (codified as 20 USC 1000 et seq.).

Student Lending 
Introduction > Background 
higher education. Among other things, the HEA increased federal money given to 
universities and awarded low-interest loans to students. Over the years, Congress has 
periodically reauthorized the HEA and has amended programs, changed the language and 
policies of existing programs, and established the statutory pricing of federal student loans. 
 
The following are some of the federal student loan programs that have been available to 
students and their parents to finance postsecondary education: 
 
• William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program (Direct Loan Program):3 These loans 
are made by the U.S. Department of Education rather than by private financial 
institutions. The Direct Loan Program comprises four types of loans: Direct Subsidized 
Stafford Loans,4 Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loans, Direct Parental Loans for 
Undergraduate Students (Direct PLUS Loans), and Direct Consolidation Loans 
(consolidation loans). These loans are direct obligations of the Education Department, are 
not underwritten, and have not been securitized. 
• Federal Perkins Loan Program:5 These are low-interest, long-term loans intended for 
undergraduate, graduate, and professional students with exceptional financial need. The 
federal government subsidizes Perkins loans, meaning interest does not accrue until the 
loan enters repayment. In the Federal Perkins Loan Program, federal funds are delivered 
to the educational institution, which then becomes the lender. The borrower makes 
payments to the educational institution or to the educational institution’s loan servicer. 
• Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP):6 The passage of the Health Care 
and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (HCERA) ended FFELP. While FFELP no 
longer exists, banks that used to participate in FFELP may still be managing a runoff7 
portfolio. These were loans funded by private banks and guaranteed by the federal 
government through the Education Department. Through FFELP, the federal government 
used to provide subsidies to private banks to offer federally insured loans that included 
subsidized and unsubsidized Stafford Loans, Direct PLUS Loans, and consolidation 
loans. 
 
The federal government’s role in financing postsecondary and higher education has grown 
significantly, and the government has now become the dominant source of financing. 
                                                           
3 This is a student loan program authorized by Title IV, part C, of the HEA (20 USC 1087a et seq.). Refer to 
34 CFR 685.100. 
 
4 The interest on a Direct Subsidized Stafford Loan is paid for by the federal government while the student is in 
school and during certain periods of deferment. 
 
5 This is a student loan program authorized by the HEA, Title IV, part D (20 USC 1087aa et seq.). Refer to 
34 CFR 673, “General Provisions for the Federal Perkins Loan Program, Federal Work-Study Program, and 
Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant Program.” Also refer to 34 CFR 674, “Federal Perkins 
Loan Program.” 
 
6 This is a student loan program formerly authorized by Title IV, part B, of the HEA (20 USC 1071 et seq.). 
Refer to 34 CFR 682, “Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program.” 
 
7 The term “runoff” is defined as reduction of a loan portfolio as loans are paid off at scheduled maturity dates 
while no new business is being booked.

Student Lending 
Introduction > Background 
Alternative loans or private student loans are loans offered through lending programs funded 
by private lending institutions. By offering private student loans, banks generally provide a 
supplement to the federal government in financing postsecondary and higher education, e.g., 
when the maximum federal student loan available to a student is less than the cost of 
attending a school. 
 
Business Model 
 
Private student loans are consumer loans offered to borrowers to fund undergraduate, 
graduate, and other forms of postsecondary education. Under Regulation Z 
(12 CFR 1026.46(b)(5)), a private education loan means an extension of credit that 
 
• is not made, insured, or guaranteed under Title IV of the HEA (20 USC 1070 et seq.). 
• is extended to a consumer expressly, in whole or in part, for postsecondary educational 
expenses, regardless of whether the loan is provided by the educational institution that the 
student attends. 
• does not include open-end credit or any loan that is secured by real property or a 
dwelling. 
• does not include an extension of credit in which the covered educational institution is the 
creditor if 
– the term of the extension of credit is 90 days or less; or 
– an interest rate will not be applied to the credit balance and the term of the extension 
of credit is one year or less, even if the credit is payable in more than four 
installments. 
 
Before the financial crisis began in 2008 and before FFELP was discontinued, some lenders 
operated on an integrated business model that included both federal guaranteed and private 
student loans. Banks held legal title to FFELP loans and received claim payments from 
eligible guarantors if eligible borrowers defaulted. FFELP loans generated income for banks 
in the form of interest income, interest subsidy payments,8 default reimbursement, and 
special allowance payments.9 Interest subsidy payments were paid while the students were in 
school, during the grace period, and during certain periods of deferment. FFELP loans 
received a 97 percent to 100 percent guarantee of principal and accrued interest, with 
reimbursement contingent on following the Education Department’s servicing guidelines and 
due diligence requirements.10 
 
                                                           
8 Interest subsidy payments are in-school interest payments on certain subsidized student loans paid for by the 
Education Department. 
 
9 Special allowance payments were subsidies from the Education Department to FFELP lenders to ensure that 
lenders received a minimum rate of return. Special allowance payments acted as an incentive for lenders to 
make education loans by, in effect, making up the difference between the interest rate charged to a FFELP 
borrower and market interest rates. 
 
10 Refer to Common Manual: Unified Student Loan Policy, chapters 10 and 12. This resource is a cooperative 
effort of all the nation’s guarantors that participate in FFELP.

Student Lending 
Introduction > Background 
The financial crisis altered the banking landscape dramatically, resulting in fewer bank 
participants in postsecondary education lending and changes in banks’ strategies. Banks had 
to reassess the long-term risk and return aspects of the private student loan business and 
make conscious decisions regarding the level and extent of their involvement in 
postsecondary education lending. Several large banks either withdrew or scaled back their 
private student loan offerings. Community banks, too, have been affected, and in many cases 
found it difficult to compete with the product array and pricing offered by larger institutions 
and the federal government. There are very few banks still engaged in private student 
lending, and those banks generally keep their portfolio exposures to a minimum. Today, the 
overall size of the private student loan portfolio is considered small compared with the 
overall size of the federal student loan portfolio. A small number of community banks, 
however, found an emerging opportunity in the federal guaranteed rehabilitated student loan 
program.11 
 
The disruption in the securitization market during the financial crisis forced banks to alter 
their strategies. Banks that were originating and selling both FFELP and private student loans 
as asset-backed securities in the secondary market were forced to keep them in bank 
portfolios. 
 
Most significantly, when the HCERA eliminated FFELP, the role of banks in federal student 
lending was discontinued for new loans. On July 1, 2010, the Direct Loan Program replaced 
FFELP12 and it has been the only source of new federal student loans since then. These loans 
are obtained through the educational institution’s financial aid office with funds provided by 
the Education Department. The terms and features of the federal student loans under the 
Direct Loan Program are similar to the terms and features of the federal student loans 
previously available through FFELP. 
 
Although FFELP has been eliminated, banks continue to own and service loans made under 
FFELP. Because of their long repayment terms (120 to 360 months), runoff FFELP loans 
remain in the banks’ portfolios. It is not unusual for examiners to find banks with both 
private student loan and federal guaranteed student loan exposures on their balance sheets. 
 
Private student loans supplement federal student loans when federal student loans and other 
financial aid are not sufficient to cover the entire cost of education. Borrowers attending 
high-cost institutions or pursuing advanced degrees may turn to private student loan 
programs for additional financing. Banks should strongly encourage their borrowers to 
exhaust scholarships, grants, other financial aid, and federal student loans before applying for 
private student loans. 
 
Student loan growth is not normally tied to the same factors that drive consumer lending, 
such as economic cyclicality, housing prices, and disposable income. In fact, student lending 
                                                           
11 Refer to the “Rehabilitated Federal Student Loans” section of this booklet for a discussion of the Federal 
Rehabilitation Student Loan Program. 
 
12 FFELP’s elimination only prohibited the making of new FFELP loans. If the first disbursement of a FFELP 
loan occurred before July 1, 2010, further disbursements of that loan could continue under FFELP. 
Comptroller’s Handbook

Student Lending 
Introduction > Background 
exhibits some counter-cyclicality. A poor job market often encourages student borrowing 
because securing a college degree can improve job prospects. Some students may stay in 
school to avoid competing in a poor job market. 
 
There is heightened public awareness and public policy attention centered on all participants 
in student lending. Banks should be mindful of the unique aspects of student lending, such as 
the significant time lag between loan advances and repayment, and the student borrower’s 
lack of certainty in finding a stable, reliable primary source of repayment after graduation. 
Banks should pursue student lending in a measured and deliberate way. If managed and 
administered in an appropriate manner, student lending could benefit banks by providing 
them with a wider array of consumer products and a more diverse business model, and 
helping them reach new customers. 
 
Private Student Loan Features 
 
Most retail loan products are straightforward in terms of underwriting, loan structure, and 
account management. The use of funds is for a specific purpose, and the source of repayment 
is well-defined, well-structured, and typically verified as reliable at origination. Private 
student loans are less straightforward and require lenders to adapt loan structures and 
repayment terms to product characteristics. 
 
Private student loans fund postsecondary education, are geared to the educational purpose of 
the loans and borrower needs, and require a substantial, long-term commitment. These loans 
lack collateral, and there is a significant time lag between loan advances and stable, reliable 
primary sources of repayment. This last factor is particularly important and often leads to 
differences in underwriting, loan repayment structures, and borrower assistance during 
repayment. Private student loans generally are not dischargeable in bankruptcy.13 
 
Student loan repayment structures (federal and private) generally provide in-school 
deferment and post-school grace periods that help borrowers transition from in-school status 
to full-time employment. Student loans generally are the only consumer product with such a 
transition. 
 
Banks that offer private student loans generally require borrower enrollment in degree-
seeking programs. Private student loan features vary by target market and finance different 
education programs, including undergraduate, law, and business; medical, dental, and other 
health-related education; and general graduate studies, parent loans for students pursuing 
these programs, and loans to borrowers attending career schools and community colleges. 
Banks offer private student loans to specifically cover costs of medical boards and clinical 
exams, medical residency interview and relocation, internships, and costs associated with 
studying for a bar exam for law graduates. Some banks offer consolidation loans to simplify 
and streamline borrower repayment into a single payment and billing due date. 
                                                           
13 Refer to 11 USC 523(a)(8), “Exceptions to Discharge.” Private student loans generally are not dischargeable 
in bankruptcy if they are originated for borrowers attending schools eligible to participate in federal student loan 
programs. Private student loans extended to students in programs without access to federal funding (i.e., certain 
trade schools) may be dischargeable in bankruptcy. 
Comptroller’s Handbook

Student Lending 
Introduction > Background 
Examiners should consider whether banks are appropriately setting the product requirements, 
term, pricing, and loan limits, and whether these features meet borrower needs and 
circumstances. Additionally, policies and procedures should provide adequate guidance to 
ensure that loans offered to borrowers are consistent with their needs, objectives, and 
financial conditions. 
 
Federal Student Loans Versus Private Student Loans 
 
Examiners should consider the unique aspects of student loans and understand that there are 
significant differences and relative similarities between federal student loan programs 
(FFELP and Direct Loan) and private student loans. 
 
Differences 
 
• Loss guarantees: FFELP loans received loss guarantees of 97 percent to 100 percent 
depending on origination dates. FFELP loans originated before October 1993 received a 
100 percent guarantee; loans originated between October 1993 and June 2006 received a 
98 percent guarantee; and loans originated on or after July 1, 2006, received a 97 percent 
guarantee. In contrast, private student loans do not carry any such federal government 
guarantee. To mitigate private student loan losses, some banks purchased loan loss 
insurance from third-party insurers. The disruption in the insurance market in 2008 ended 
this practice. 
• Application: A borrower must complete and file the Free Application for Federal 
Student Aid (FAFSA) form with the educational institution’s financial aid office to apply 
for a federal student loan. No FAFSA form is required to apply for a private student loan. 
• Pricing and loan amount: Interest rates and loan borrowing limits on federal student 
loans are set by statute for all eligible borrowers under a particular loan program.14 
Private student loan interest rates and loan amounts are risk-based. 
• Criteria: The borrower eligibility criteria for federal student loans allow most borrowers 
to qualify. Federal eligibility criteria rely on federal needs analysis methodology and do 
not, in most cases, employ credit checks, with the exception of PLUS loans.15 Private 
student loans are underwritten based on a set of risk-based, lender-developed credit 
criteria that consider the borrower’s credit history and ability to repay, and often require a 
cosigner(s). 
                                                           
14 20 USC 1087e(b)(8), “Terms and Conditions of Loans: Interest Rate Provisions for New Loans On or After 
July 1, 2013,” establishes the current interest rates for direct loans. 20 USC 1077a, “Applicable Interest Rates,” 
established maximum interest rates for federal guaranteed loans made under FFELP, including Direct PLUS 
Loans. 
 
15 Under 20 USC 1087kk et seq., the term “needs analysis” is defined as a standardized assessment of a 
student’s or a student’s family’s ability to contribute toward educational expenses. 
Comptroller’s Handbook

Student Lending 
Introduction > Background 
• Default: The Education Department defines a default on a federal student loan as 
occurring after 270 days of nonpayment.16 A private student loan is in default after 
120 days of nonpayment.17 
• Workout program: Any workout program offered by banks to financially distressed 
private borrowers should follow existing banking guidance, and adhere to generally 
accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in determining if the loan constitutes a troubled 
debt restructuring (TDR). Federal student loan statutes do not have the same 
requirements. 
• Collection tools: 
– A lawsuit is the main tool available to banks to pursue collection of defaulted private 
student loans. In contrast, defaulted federal student loans can be pursued using 
additional tools outside of court, including seizure of tax refunds, garnishment of 
wages without a court order, denial of other financial student aid and grants, taking a 
portion of Social Security benefits received, and revocation of professional or 
vocational licenses. 
– Depending on the state, banks may have to consider the applicable statute of 
limitations to enforce private student loan court judgments. Some states allow banks 
to continuously renew the judgments to prevent them from being subjected to statute 
of limitations. In comparison, there are no statutes of limitations for collection on 
federal student loans.18 
 
Similarities 
 
• Academic year basis: Both federal and private student loan programs generally grant or 
separately approve loans for each academic year.19 
• In-school deferment and grace period: Both federal and private student loan programs 
generally allow the deferment of payments while borrowers are attending school at least 
                                                           
16 For federal student loans, default is the failure of a borrower (or endorser or co-maker, if any) to make 
installment payments when due, if this failure persists for the most recent period of 270 days (for a loan 
repayable in monthly installments) or the most recent 330-day period (for a loan repayable in less frequent 
installments). Refer to Common Manual: Unified Student Loan Policy, “Appendix G: Glossary.” 
 
17 Refer to OCC Bulletin 2000-20, “Uniform Retail Credit Classification and Account Management Policy: 
Policy Implementation.” 
 
18 Section 484A(a) of the HEA provides that no statute of limitations bars enforcement action to collect federal 
student loans, including collection by offset, lawsuit, or enforcement on student loan judgments. 
20 USC 1091a(a), “Statute of Limitations, and State Court Judgments,” states that state law that would 
otherwise limit these actions is superseded by federal law and cannot bar collection action. 
 
19 The Education Department uses the academic year for determining a borrower’s Title IV aid eligibility. The 
term “academic year” is defined as a period during which an undergraduate, full-time student is expected to 
complete either of the following: (1) at least 30 weeks of instructional time and 24 semester or trimester hours, 
or 36 quarter hours in an educational program that measures program length in credit hours, or (2) at least 26 
weeks of instructional time and 900 clock hours in an educational program that measures program length in 
clock hours. Refer to Common Manual: Unified Student Loan Policy, “Appendix G: Glossary.”

• half time. Both types of programs generally provide for a six-month grace period after 
graduation or separation from school before repayment begins. 
• Bankruptcy: Both private and federal student loans generally are not dischargeable in 
bankruptcy unless borrowers can establish that repaying the loans would cause “undue 
hardship.”20 
 
Risks Associated With Private Student Lending 
 
From a supervisory perspective, risk is the potential that events will have an adverse effect on 
a bank’s current or projected financial condition21 and resilience.22 The OCC has defined 
eight categories of risk for bank supervision purposes: credit, interest rate, liquidity, price, 
operational, compliance, strategic, and reputation. These categories are not mutually 
exclusive. Any product or service may expose a bank to multiple risks. Risks also may be 
interdependent and may be positively or negatively correlated. Examiners should be aware of 
this interdependence and assess the effect in a consistent and inclusive manner. Examiners 
also should be alert to concentrations that can significantly elevate risk. Concentrations can 
accumulate within and across products, business lines, geographic areas, countries, and legal 
entities. Refer to the “Bank Supervision Process” booklet of the Comptroller’s Handbook for 
an expanded discussion of banking risks and their definitions. 
 
The risks associated with private student lending are credit, operational, compliance, 
liquidity, strategic, reputation, and interest rate. 
 
Credit Risk 
 
Credit risk is the most significant risk in private student lending. Private student loans are 
atypical of consumer loans because banks generally rely on the student borrower’s 
prospective ability to repay. Private student loans finance a postsecondary education that 
often requires a considerable loan amount and a long-term bank commitment. These loans 
lack collateral, and there usually is a significant time lag between loan advances and the start 
of repayment. Borrowers are expected to graduate and generate a stable, reliable primary 
source of repayment, but whether they will actually do so is uncertain. Banks take on the 
credit risk based on reasonable assumptions of the borrower’s and cosigner’s ability to repay. 
Banks engaged in private student lending not only rely on traditional consumer lending 
criteria but also consider school eligibility criteria, such as program completion, graduation  
                                                           
20 Refer to 11 USC 523(a)(8), “Exceptions to Discharge.” 
 
21 Financial condition includes impacts from diminished capital and liquidity. Capital in this context includes 
potential impacts from losses, reduced earnings, and market value of equity. 
 
22 Resilience recognizes the bank’s ability to withstand periods of stress.

Introduction > Risks Associated With Private Student Lending 
rates, and the cost of attendance.23 Without considering school eligibility factors, banks could 
be exposed to higher credit risk. 
 
Consumer attitudes toward debt, affordability of higher education, underwriting standards, 
federal education policy, government public interests, and risk layering all can affect credit 
risk in private student loans. The effects of these factors are more pronounced for banks that 
lend to higher-risk borrowers with limited credit history and no direct source of repayment. 
In addition, private student loans can have elevated credit risk due to their variable rate 
feature and extended repayment terms. An unreasonable repayment period without 
consideration of the loan size may contribute to credit risk. Borrowers and cosigners who use 
deferment to delay loan repayment could pose increased credit risk to the bank. While in 
deferment, the loan amount continues to increase because of capitalized interest and may 
mean higher cost to borrowers. 
 
Concentration risk is related to and affects credit risk. Concentration risk in private student 
lending can result from originating a large volume of loans to a specific class of borrowers, 
product type, and educational institution, or to borrowers affected by common economic 
events. Credit risk exists throughout the lending cycles of private student loans. These cycles 
include acquisition, initial underwriting, account management, and collection. Similar to 
other consumer loans, private student lending involves grouping homogeneous loans when 
credit risk is evaluated and managed on a segment or pooled basis. 
 
Credit risk can be reduced in several ways. Banks should have a rigorous process of 
assessing their risk appetite, establishing product concentration limits measured as a 
percentage of capital, and charting forward-looking business strategies. Banks can control 
their credit risks by having strong credit risk management processes to guard against the 
unexpected and to measure, monitor, and control risks. Banks should have clearly 
documented and updated policies and procedures, underwriting standards, effective 
collection programs, and good management information systems (MIS). 
 
Examiners assess credit risk in private student lending by evaluating portfolio performance, 
profitability, borrower profiles, products, and markets. Examiners should consider changes in 
underwriting standards, account acquisition channels, the credit score system used by the 
bank, and its marketing strategy. 
 
Operational Risk 
 
Similar to other retail loan products, student loan credit operations are primarily process-
based and rely extensively on technology and automation along with ongoing innovation. For 
example, most banks have an application processing system (auto-decision system) that is 
                                                           
23 The cost of attendance (COA) is an estimate of the student’s educational expenses for the period of 
enrollment. The COA estimate should include tuition and fees, room and board, books and supplies, 
transportation, and personal expenses. COA is used solely for determining financial aid. The COA should 
include only those costs already incurred, or expected to be incurred, by the student over the course of the loan 
period. COA may not include outstanding charges or fees from a previous period of enrollment.

programmed to streamline the student loan decision process. The process systematically 
approves applicants who meet preapproved requirements. Banks employ credit scoring24 
technology. Because the operations tend to be so highly automated, banks should manage the 
processes prudently and maintain the systems and controls necessary to effectively identify, 
measure, monitor, and control operational risk. 
 
Almost all banks engaged in student lending use third parties to perform various operational 
functions, such as loan acquisition and origination, servicing, and collections. Increased due 
diligence is required in these situations to minimize operational risk. Outsourcing specific 
activities may provide enhanced profitability; the risk, however, remains with the banks. 
OCC Bulletin 2013-29, “Third-Party Relationships: Risk Management Guidance,” sets forth 
supervisory expectations in this area for banks. 
 
Fraud is another operational risk present in private student lending. Banks should guard 
against private student loan fraud by verifying that funds are used to pay borrowers’ tuition 
and other education expenses. Operating through the school channel versus a direct-to-
consumer channel allows for such verification. 
 
Examiners assess operational risk by evaluating the adequacy of private student loan 
application, processing, loan servicing, and collections systems and controls. Examiners 
should consider the volume of accounts managed, the capabilities of systems and 
technologies in relation to current and prospective volume, contingency preparedness, and 
exposures throughout the servicing system. 
 
Compliance Risk 
 
A significant number of consumer-related laws and regulations affect private student lending 
and make this type of lending vulnerable to compliance risk. The origination and collection 
of private student loans are subject to federal and state consumer protection laws and 
regulations. Banks’ failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in the 
assessment of fees, penalties, and adverse ratings. The following is a list of some of the 
consumer-related laws and regulations25 applicable to private student lending: 
 
• The Truth in Lending Act of 1968 (TILA), as implemented by Regulation Z 
(12 CFR 1026), and amended by the Higher Education Opportunity Act of 2008, which 
                                                           
24 Credit scorecards provide an objective, numerical measure of a borrower’s creditworthiness based on 
statistical models that evaluate performance and other factors. Credit scorecards, also referred to as models, are 
risk-ranking tools that attempt to differentiate between accounts that will exhibit “good” behavior and those that 
will not. (The definition of “bad” accounts varies but typically involves some level of delinquency, usually 60+ 
or 90+ days past due.) The scores generated indicate the relative level of risk in either ascending or descending 
order, depending on the convention used by the model developer. Credit scoring also is used to control risk in 
acquisition and underwriting, account management, and collection processes. 
 
25 Other Comptroller’s Handbook booklets in the Consumer Compliance series address these laws and 
regulations more fully. For each of these laws and regulations, refer to the relevant booklet, which includes 
updated information and complete examination procedures.

added disclosure, timing, and other requirements for lenders making private education 
loans.26 Regulation Z contains rules on disclosures, limitations on changes in terms after 
approval, the right to cancel the loan, and limitations on co-branding27 in the marketing 
of private education loans (12 CFR 1026.46 to 12 CFR 1026.48). 
• The Electronic Fund Transfer Act of 1978 (EFTA), as implemented by Regulation E 
(12 CFR 1005), which governs electronic fund transfers, such as telephone bill payments 
from borrowers and remote banking programs.28 
• The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act of 1977 (FDCPA) and as subsequently amended, 
which is designed to eliminate certain abusive, deceptive, and unfair debt collection 
practices by debt collectors (generally those who regularly collect, or attempt to collect, 
consumer debts for another person or institution, or use a name other than their own when 
collecting their consumer debts).29 
• The Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1970 (FCRA), as implemented by Regulation V 
(12 CFR 1022), which, among other requirements, imposes duties on furnishers of 
information to consumer reporting agencies.30 
• The Equal Credit Opportunity Act of 1974 (ECOA), as implemented by Regulation B 
(12 CFR 1002), which prohibits discrimination in any aspect of a credit transaction and 
requires banks to provide adverse action notices to consumers.31 
• The Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act of 1999 (GLBA), as implemented by Regulation P 
(12 CFR 1016), which requires banks to provide privacy notices and limit information 
sharing in specific ways.32 
• Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act and sections 1031 and 1036 of the 
Dodd–Frank Wall Street and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, which together prohibit 
unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices in banks’ interactions with consumers.33 
• The Servicemembers Civil Relief Act of 2003 (SCRA), which, among other relief 
provisions for servicemembers, requires creditors to reduce the interest rate on debt

incurred before entry into military service to no more than 6 percent upon receipt of a 
written request and a copy of military orders.34 
• The Military Lending Act of 2006 (MLA), which applies to all student loans not 
excluded from TILA. The rule expands specific protections provided to servicemembers 
and their families under the MLA and addresses a wider range of credit products than the 
U.S. Department of Defense’s previous regulation.35 
 
Bank management should assess whether staff and third parties involved in marketing, loan 
processing, servicing, and collections activity comply fully with these laws and regulations. 
Equally important, examiners should be familiar with applicable laws and regulations that 
affect private student lending. 
 
Liquidity Risk 
 
Banks engaged in private student lending generally fund their portfolios either through asset-
backed securitization or by leveraging the banks’ deposit base, or a combination of the two. 
Banks are exposed to liquidity risk when student loans are not in active repayment. Most 
private student loan programs allow students who are in school or in grace, deferment, or 
forbearance periods to defer payment of principal or interest or both. These loans not in 
active repayment status do not generate cash flow. The time lag for loans in deferment and 
forbearance presents additional liquidity risk to banks in the form of increased durations of 
loans and possible increased default frequency. 
 
For banks with off-balance-sheet private student loan exposures, interest and principal on 
bonds backed by such collateral may still be due during periods of reduced cash flow. To 
avoid shortfalls in available funds to make such payments, banks often include capitalized 
interest accounts to cover the amount of reduced cash flow expected on the specific portfolio. 
 
Liquidity risk is present if banks securitize their private student loan portfolios. Underwriting 
standards and administrative policies and procedures may not meet market requirements or 
expectations. Such an event may increase costs or limit access to funding markets in the 
future. Portfolio composition and portfolio volatility affect the salability of portfolios to 
investors and for securitization. Examiners should refer to the “Asset Securitization” booklet 
of the Comptroller’s Handbook for more information on securitization and on how to 
examine these activities. 
 
Strategic Risk 
 
Banks offering private student loans should understand and evaluate competition, market 
conditions, borrower behavior, and economic, regulatory, and environmental factors that 
affect the industry. When making any changes to strategic direction, such as offering new

Dependents.”

Student Lending 
Introduction > Risks Associated With Private Student Lending 
student loan products, altering pricing strategies, expanding product features, or encouraging 
growth, banks should consider relevant factors. Banks’ decision to enter, exit, or otherwise 
change their participation in the market should have a sound basis rooted in thorough 
evaluation of all available information and due diligence.36 Banks should realistically assess 
the risk involved in such decisions and evaluate whether these decisions are consistent with 
their management expertise, operating capacity, and resources, and align with their risk 
appetite and capital adequacy. The failure to properly assess these factors may expose banks 
to unnecessary and unanticipated strategic risk and financial loss. 
 
Reputation Risk 
 
Customer dissatisfaction due to operational breakdowns, general weaknesses in any aspect of 
the private student lending program, and inadequate policies and procedures can harm banks’ 
reputation. Reputation risk can escalate if borrowers perceive that lending practices are 
unfair, deceptive, abusive, or predatory. Delegation of bank functions to third parties 
heightens reputation risk. 
 
Technological and news media developments have made reputation risk more consequential 
than ever before for banks engaged in private student lending. Poor servicing of existing 
accounts or non-resolution of borrower issues can generate immediate headlines and negative 
publicity for banks. The 2008 financial crisis brought attention to the large amount of overall 
student debt (both federal and private). For many higher education stakeholders, it has been 
difficult to differentiate between bank and nonbank private student loan lenders. During the 
economic downturn, high unemployment along with increased student loan default (federal 
and private) exposed banks to negative headlines concerning private student loans. Private 
student loan portfolios may be small in scale and not material to the banks’ overall business, 
but the reputation risk could be significant. 
 
Appropriate systems and controls to identify, measure, monitor, and control reputation risk 
are critical to a bank’s risk management. 
 
Interest Rate Risk 
 
Most private student loans have a variable rate feature that is sensitive to yield curve risk. 
Any shifts in the yield curve or flattening of the yield curve can have an adverse impact on 
the portfolio. Deferring payments while borrowers are in school at least half time is a 
common practice in private student lending. This unique characteristic of private student 
lending could make banks vulnerable to additional interest rate risk because of timing of cash 
flows and changes in both cash flow and earnings spread.

Introduction > Risk Management and Control Systems 
Risk Management and Control Systems 
 
Each bank should identify, measure, monitor, and control risk by implementing an effective 
risk management system appropriate for the size and complexity of its operations. When 
examiners assess the effectiveness of a bank’s risk management system, they consider the 
bank’s policies, processes, personnel, and control systems. Refer to the “Bank Supervision 
Process” booklet of the Comptroller’s Handbook for an expanded discussion of risk 
management. 
 
Marketing and Account Acquisition 
 
Private student loan originations may rely on multiple marketing channels. These channels 
may include bank branches, direct mail, school referral, and online or Internet sourcing. 
 
For the school referral channel, banks may employ sales forces that establish relationships 
with school financial aid offices as preferred lenders.37 Banks target students at schools with 
applications generally submitted online. Banks use direct-to-consumer marketing and online 
channels to target borrowers and reach broader footprints. The most common method of 
application is through secure websites operated directly by banks or third parties. Banks use 
direct mail and sales staff focused on targeted schools. 
 
Before the financial crisis, contractual relationships existed between banks and guaranty 
agencies that originated (underwrote), guaranteed, disbursed, and serviced private student 
loans on behalf of banks. Very few of these relationships survived the financial crisis. 
 
Whatever channels banks employ to originate private student loans, banks should have the 
systems to monitor the performance of those channels and control any risks. Failure to 
implement strong control environments can lead to such problems as fraud, compliance 
issues, or a host of situations with unexpected consequences. 
 
Banks that originate private student loans are bound by TILA requirements. The general rules 
applicable to the special disclosure requirements for private education loans are detailed in  
                                                           
37 The Higher Education Opportunity Act defines a “preferred lender arrangement” as an arrangement or 
agreement between a creditor and a school under which the creditor provides loans to the school’s students or 
their families, and the school recommends, promotes, or endorses the creditor’s loans. The term “preferred 
lender arrangement” is defined in 20 USC 1019(8), “Preferred Lender Arrangement.” 15 USC 1650(a)(5), 
“Preventing Unfair and Deceptive Private Educational Lending Practices and Eliminating Conflicts of Interest,” 
contains a cross-reference to 20 USC 1019(8). The term is also discussed in 20 USC 1019a, “Responsibilities of 
Covered Institutions, Institution-Affiliated Organizations, and Lenders”; 20 USC 1019b, “Loan Information to 
Be Disclosed and Model Disclosure Form for Covered Institutions, Institution-Affiliated Organizations, and 
Lenders Participating in Preferred Lender Arrangements”; 20 USC 1094, “Program Participation Agreements”; 
and 15 USC 1638, “Transactions Other Than Under an Open End Credit Plan.”

Introduction > Risk Management and Control Systems 
12 CFR 1026.46 and associated commentary. Banks must comply with Regulation Z 
requirements, which include the following: 
 
• Disclosure requirements:38 
– Provide disclosures on or with applications or solicitations (12 CFR 1026.47(a)). 
– Provide disclosures on or with a notice of loan approval (12 CFR 1026.47(b)). 
– Provide disclosures before loan disbursement (12 CFR 1026.47(c)). 
• Limitations on private education loans: 
– Prohibit co-branding in the marketing of private education loans 
(12 CFR 1026.48(a)), unless an arrangement is entered into by the creditor and school 
for its endorsement and the marketing includes the proper disclosures 
(12 CFR 1026.48(b)). 
– Provide 30 calendar days to accept the loan consistent with the borrower’s right to 
accept loan terms (12 CFR 1026.48(c)). 
– Provide a three-day right to cancel after receipt of final disclosures 
(12 CFR 1026.48(d)). 
– Obtain self-certification from the borrower before loan consummation 
(12 CFR 1026.48(e)). 
– Require banks in preferred lender arrangements to provide certain information to the 
school for each type of private student loan that the bank offers (12 CFR 1026.48(f)). 
 
Banks must comply with the rules and requirements in section 140 of TILA (15 USC 1650) 
that address the following: 
 
• Prohibit any private educational lender from offering or providing any gift to a covered 
educational institution in exchange for any advantage related to the private educational 
lender’s private education loan activities. 
• Prohibit any private educational lender from directly or indirectly engaging in revenue 
sharing39 with a covered educational institution. 
• Prohibit co-branding, which means that a private educational lender may not use words, 
pictures, or symbols readily identified with the covered educational institution in the 
marketing of private education loans in any way that implies that the covered educational 
institution endorses the private education loans offered by the private educational lender. 
• Prohibit any financial aid office employee, or other person who is employed in the 
financial aid office of a covered educational institution, or who otherwise has 
responsibilities with respect to private education loans or other financial aid of the 
institution, and who serves on an advisory board, commission, or group established by a 
private educational lender or group of such lenders, from receiving anything of value 
                                                           
38 Model forms for these disclosures are available in Regulation Z’s appendix H (pages H18–H23). 
 
39 The term “revenue sharing” is defined as “an arrangement between a covered educational institution and a 
private educational lender under which—(A) a private educational lender provides or issues private education 
loans with respect to students attending the covered educational institution; (B) the covered educational 
institution recommends to students or others the private educational lender or the private education loans of the 
private educational lender; and (C) the private educational lender pays a fee or provides other material benefits, 
including profit sharing, to the covered educational institution in connection with the private education loans 
provided to students attending the covered educational institution or a borrower acting on behalf of a student.” 
Comptroller’s Handbook

from the lender or group (other than reimbursement of reasonable expenses incurred as 
part of service on an advisory board, commission, or group). 
• Prohibit prepayment or repayment fees or penalties. 
• Require public disclosure of any contract or other agreement made between an institution 
of higher education and a card issuer or creditor for the purpose of marketing a credit 
card. 
 
To manage risk, bank management should ensure that all private student lending origination 
and marketing activities have the appropriate oversight, provide necessary disclosures, and 
comply with applicable rules and regulations. When pursuing school preferred lender 
relationships, banks should make certain that all sales representatives follow appropriate 
codes of conduct and ethics that include compliance with the requirements of Regulation Z 
and section 140 of TILA. 
 
Examiners should assess whether banks engaged in private student lending provide clear and 
conspicuous disclosures that contain the information required in 12 CFR 1026.47. This 
information includes topics such as applicable interest rates, fees, default and late payment 
costs, repayment terms, cost estimates, eligibility requirements, federal program alternatives 
to private student loans, the borrower’s right to loan terms that remain generally unchanged 
for 30 days, and the prerequisite borrower self-certification requirement.40 Banks must 
provide this information to borrowers and adequately address what borrowers need to know 
before obtaining private student loans. In addition, banks must comply with approval 
disclosure requirements as well as final disclosure requirements under section 
12 CFR 1026.47. 
 
Banks that use third parties to market, solicit, or originate private student loans should have 
third-party risk management frameworks that include 
 
• due diligence in selecting third parties. 
• written contracts that have been thoroughly vetted for duties, obligations, and 
responsibilities of all parties including compensation parameters. 
• ongoing monitoring and quality assurance programs. 
 
Banks should adhere to other regulatory expectations regarding risk management outlined in 
OCC Bulletin 2013-29, “Third-Party Relationships: Risk Management Guidance.” Banks’ 
risk management systems should reflect the complexity of third-party activities and the 
overall level of risk involved. 
 
Private Student Lending Underwriting Standards 
 
Banks’ risk appetite, or the level of risk they are willing to take, is the basis of the banks’ 
specific underwriting criteria. Higher education financing may be the only consumer product 
for which lenders generally consider cosigners’ current ability to repay the loans rather than 
                                                           
40 This list consists of the required preapproval disclosures in 12 CFR 1026.47(a), “Application or Solicitation 
Disclosures.” The contents of the approval disclosures and the disbursement disclosures are different. 
Comptroller’s Handbook 
16 
Student Lending 
Introduction > Risk Management and Control Systems 
the borrowers’ future income. Despite their unique purpose and nature, private student loans 
are unsecured retail credit products, and banks should adhere to safe and sound credit 
underwriting and documentation standards as stated in 12 CFR 30, appendix A, “Safety and 
Soundness Standards,” that include the following: 
 
Prudent credit underwriting practices that 
 
• are commensurate with the types of loans banks will make and that consider the terms 
and conditions under which the loans will be made. 
• consider the nature of the markets in which loans will be made. 
• provide for consideration, before credit commitment, of borrowers’ overall financial 
condition and resources, the financial responsibility of any guarantors, the nature and 
value of any underlying collateral, and borrowers’ character and willingness to repay as 
agreed. 
• establish a system of independent, ongoing credit review and appropriate communication 
to management and to the board of directors. 
• take adequate account of capital planning consistent with strategic planning and 
associated concentration of credit risk. 
• are appropriate to the banks’ size and the nature and scope of the banks’ activities. 
 
Loan documentation practices that 
 
• enable the banks to make informed lending decisions and to assess risk, as necessary, on 
an ongoing basis. 
• identify the loans’ purpose and sources of repayment and assess the borrowers’ ability to 
repay the indebtedness in a timely manner. 
• ensure that any claim against borrowers is legally enforceable. 
• demonstrate appropriate administration and monitoring of loans. 
• take account of the loans’ size and complexity. 
 
Private student loans vary significantly in terms of underwriting, pricing, maximum loan 
amounts, and repayment terms. Underwriting and product terms should appropriately 
recognize the risks of unsecured lending to a higher-risk borrower population (by virtue of 
unproven credit records). The ability of students to achieve gainful employment after 
graduation is one of the determinants of default frequency. 
 
Private student loans should be carefully underwritten to minimize the occurrence of default 
or the need to provide repayment assistance. Banks should have adequate and sound credit 
policies and procedures that focus on the main criteria for decision-making and verification  
Comptroller’s Handbook 
17 
Student Lending 
Introduction > Risk Management and Control Systems 
processes. The following are some of the underwriting factors and requirements that banks 
have used in private student lending:41 
 
• Educational institution and education program 
• Borrower and cosigner creditworthiness 
• Maximum student debt per academic year and cost of attendance (COA) 
• Marketing channel 
• Credit bureau risk score 
• Credit history 
• Minimum gross income 
• Income verification 
• Loan features and structure 
• Citizenship status and U.S. residency 
 
Educational Institutions 
 
Some private student lenders use factors relating to the educational institutions that 
borrowers attend for determining underwriting and pricing of private student loans.42 Banks 
have considered 
 
• educational institutions’ financial history, accreditation, financial stability, and long-term 
viability. 
• the average time and cost to complete degrees or programs. 
• the average dropout, graduation, and completion rates. 
• employment rates and average salaries for graduates and, if available, for dropouts. 
• banks’ own default rate experience regarding the educational institutions’ borrowers who 
recently entered repayment. 
 
When banks target borrowers enrolled at particular institutions or in specific education 
programs, comprehensive and effective due diligence is critical to understanding the level of 
risk assumed. Banks should update and review this information regularly, or at least 
annually, and perform the due diligence as long as the relationships with particular 
educational institutions continue. 
 
Some banks consider lending only to borrowers attending educational institutions that pass 
the Education Department’s eligibility criteria. School eligibility is defined by the Education 
Department as those institutions qualified to participate in Title IV of the HEA, and one of 
the required conditions for a school to qualify is to have an acceptable cohort default rate 
                                                           
41 Banks using factors that may not be related to loan terms or borrower creditworthiness, such as the 
educational institution or citizenship status, should closely consider and monitor the fair lending implications of 
these factors. Refer to the “Educational Institutions” section of this booklet. 
 
42 Refer to GAO-10-86R, “Higher Education: Factors Lenders Consider in Making Lending Decisions for 
Private Education Loans,” November 17, 2009. 
Comptroller’s Handbook 
18 
Student Lending 
Introduction > Risk Management and Control Systems 
(CDR) on federal student loans.43 CDR consideration in private lending for school eligibility, 
underwriting, or pricing may have a disproportionate negative impact on minority students 
who disproportionately attend schools with higher CDRs.44 Banks should carefully analyze 
the potential fair lending implications of using CDR and other non-individual factors and 
document the legitimate business need for their use. 
 
Another criterion that banks generally consider is the type of educational institution. The 
Education Department defines three types of eligible institutions of higher education: public 
or private nonprofit institutions, proprietary institutions (private and for-profit), and public or 
private nonprofit postsecondary vocational institutions defined in 34 CFR 600.4, 
34 CFR 600.5, 34 CFR 600.6, and 34 CFR 600.9. Banks that extend loans to borrowers who 
attend nontraditional education programs or alternative programs should take into 
consideration that certain trade schools or vocational institutions may not have access to 
federal funding under Title IV. Therefore, private student loans extended to finance 
attendance in these institutions may be dischargeable in bankruptcy. 
 
To manage risk, banks should track loan performance and report on established concentration 
limits for each student loan program, geographic area, school type (graduate program, four- 
or two-year institution, or trade school), origination channel (e.g., school or online), and loan 
quality or risk grade. 
 
Borrower Creditworthiness 
 
Banks should have underwriting criteria designed to measure the borrowers’ financial 
capacity, in terms of disposable income available for orderly debt repayment, and willingness 
to repay, typically based on past performance on financial obligations. Because there is no 
reliable method for considering future income or other future events in the underwriting 
process of private student loans, banks typically require cosigners on loans. This allows for 
additional borrower support if borrowers are unable to make loan payments after graduation 
or program completion. 
 
A cosigner is any person who assumes personal liability, in any capacity, for the obligation 
of a borrower without receiving goods, services, or money in return for the obligation. The 
cosigner is equally and severally liable and is expected to make payments on the primary 
borrower’s debt should that borrower default. Having a cosigner is a way for a private 
student loan borrower with a low income or poor or limited credit history to qualify for and 
obtain more favorable financing terms. 
 
Most banks offer cosigners a release option after the initial 36 to 48 consecutive, on-time 
payments of principal and interest after repayment begins, subject to verification of the 
primary borrower’s continuous ability to repay. Most banks offer cosigner release in the 
unfortunate event of the student borrower’s death or total and permanent disability. Banks 
                                                           
43 Refer to 34 CFR 668.206, “Consequences of Cohort Default Rates on Your Ability to Participate in Title IV, 
HEA Programs.”

Student Lending 
Introduction > Risk Management and Control Systems 
that offer the cosigner release option should keep track of this feature in the loan agreements 
and fulfill the terms. 
 
A key component in underwriting student loan applications is the assessment of affordability 
of the loan and taking into account the borrowers’ and cosigners’ (if any) ability to meet all 
debt service requirements for existing and proposed loans. Banks may account for adequate 
margin in debt service requirements to protect against adverse changes in borrowers’ and 
cosigners’ (if any) circumstances. 
 
When determining ability to repay, the bank’s underwriting criteria rely heavily on the 
cosigner’s income streams and assets while taking into account all of the cosigner’s 
obligations. A credible analysis should conclude that the borrower and cosigner can meet all 
debt service requirements for existing and proposed loans using regularly amortizing 
payments. 
 
In some private student loan programs, borrowers may be able to qualify on their own 
without the need for cosigners. To qualify, borrowers should have credit scores that meet the 
program minimums and may need to satisfy any employment, income, or asset requirements. 
 
When evaluating borrowers’ and cosigners’ ability to repay, banks should consider all debt 
obligations, including monthly rent or mortgage, auto loans, other student loans (in 
repayment and deferment), alimony and child support, minimum credit card payments, and 
other debt payments. 
 
The determination of borrowers’ and cosigners’ ability to repay should be based on reliable 
information, including documented and verified income. Some of the most common and 
acceptable documentation includes 
 
• recent pay stubs. 
• W-2 forms. 
• evidence of payroll direct deposit. 
• personal or business tax returns. 
• signed 1099 forms. 
• verification of employment through employer direct contact. 
• divorce decree or other legal document to verify child support or alimony payments. 
• other appropriate documentation, such as a social security award letter and investment 
statements. 
 
Credit Bureau Risk Score 
 
As a credit overlay, banks often use credit scores in loan underwriting and rely on credit 
bureau data to gauge credit history, payment experience, and performance. Credit scores 
project the probability of future payment performance based on past experience. For some 
banks, borrowers’ credit scores serve as the key requirement in the decision to approve or 
decline applications in the underwriting process. Most banks, however, use credit scores for 
screening and subsequently perform additional review based on other credit criteria. 
Comptroller’s Handbook

Student Lending 
Introduction > Risk Management and Control Systems 
As with any other consumer loan product, banks that use credit scores in private student 
lending should control credit quality by setting appropriate cutoff scores based on acceptable 
default risk or loss rate. Bank management may change the cutoff credit score, and this 
change alters the risk profile of the originated loans. The cutoff credit score is one of the 
control mechanisms for volume (quantity) and profit (quality) in private student loans. As a 
basic principle, the higher the cutoff credit score, the lower the approval rate and fewer the 
delinquency problems. Decisions to change the cutoff credit score reflect a change of 
strategy, a change in quality of applicants, and a change in expected level of profitability. 
Bank management should ensure that credit scoring models are used appropriately and are 
functioning effectively. Bank management should 
 
• thoroughly understand the credit scoring models. 
• use credit scoring models for their intended purpose. 
• validate or revalidate the credit scoring models’ performance regularly. 
• review tracking reports, including the performance of overrides. 
• take appropriate action when the credit scoring models’ performance deteriorates, 
including reviewing bank lending strategies to determine their effect on the credit scoring 
models; actively managing the credit scoring model cutoff strategies; or developing new 
credit scoring models. 
• ensure the credit scoring models comply with fair lending regulations. 
 
Credit scoring models used in student lending should be subject to sound model validation 
processes, including evaluation of conceptual soundness, ongoing monitoring, and outcomes 
analysis. 
 
For a basic explanation of credit score models, refer to OCC Bulletin 1997-24, “Credit 
Scoring Models: Examiner Guidance,” and OCC Bulletin 2011-12, “Supervisory Guidance 
on Model Risk Management.” 
 
Banks should have credit underwriting criteria that include measurements of borrowers’ and 
cosigners’ capacity to repay the loans (debt-to-income or payment-to-income), acceptable 
documentation, cutoff credit score and tolerance for overrides, and school eligibility 
requirements. Banks that have underwriting standards that are less stringent than industry and 
market standards should establish portfolio concentration limits on these lesser-qualified 
borrowers to minimize the banks’ exposure to a manageable level. 
 
Loan Feature and Structure 
 
Banks offer a range of private student loan features and structures. Interest rates may be fixed 
or adjustable; repayment terms may be straight amortization or graduated; and repayment 
periods may be shorter (10 years or less) or longer (over 10 years). Banks generally consider 
these factors jointly in the qualification process and should develop a range of reasonable 
tolerances for each factor. Underwriting should be based on prudent and appropriate 
underwriting standards, taking into account borrowers’ characteristics and private student 
loan attributes. 
 
Comptroller’s Handbook 
21 
Student Lending 
Introduction > Risk Management and Control Systems 
Banks that offer graduated repayment terms at origination should follow the prudent 
standards outlined in OCC Bulletin 2015-7, “Interagency Guidance on Private Student Loans 
With Graduated Repayment Terms at Origination.” Borrowers and banks generally are best 
served by amortizing repayment of principal and interest over reasonable periods. When 
considering graduated repayment terms, banks should promote orderly repayment over the 
life of the loans. Banks should consider providing longer repayment periods (e.g., 20 years) 
for larger loans and shorter repayment periods for smaller loans. 
 
Maximum Student Debt 
 
Banks generally set private student loan amount limits according to the published cost of 
attendance at the borrowers’ schools, with lifetime caps based on the students’ programs of 
study. The schools set the overall loan limit for each student based on qualified education 
expenses up to the cost of attendance, less all other student aid received,45 and any other 
loans already applied to the cost for the academic year. 
 
Banks require school certification or verification of enrollment to ensure that students are 
borrowing responsibly and that the loan amounts requested do not exceed the borrowers’ 
COA. School financial aid offices certify borrowers’ need for loans and the amount that 
borrowers are eligible to borrow. School certification provides the following additional 
information: academic period, enrollment status and grade level, expected graduation date, 
and disbursement date. Federal law requires that before lenders may disburse private student 
loans, the lenders must obtain completed and signed self-certification forms46 from 
borrowers. 
 
Disbursement of funds may include certified checks jointly payable to the students and the 
schools, or electronic funds transfers of loan proceeds to student accounts at the eligible 
schools. Depending on the loan purpose, there is generally a cumulative limit47 on total loans 
that banks grant and variation on loan terms (5, 10, 15, 20, or more years). 
 
Pricing 
 
Pricing is a key component of underwriting. Private student loans can have either a fixed 
interest rate or a variable interest rate. Fixed-rate loans are determined at the time of 
application approval and remain the same for the life of the loan. A variable rate is based on 
an index such as the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)48 or prime lending rate plus a 
fixed margin rate determined by borrower and cosigner creditworthiness at the time of 
application. The variable index rate may change on a monthly or quarterly basis. Banks price 
                                                           
45 Such aid includes grants, scholarships, fellowships, and financial awards. 
 
46 This information is included in the borrower’s financial award letter from the school. The form is also 
available from the school’s financial aid office. 
 
47 The cumulative limit includes both federal and private student loans. 
 
48 LIBOR is the average interest rate paid on deposits of U.S. dollars in the London market.

Student Lending 
Introduction > Risk Management and Control Systems 
private student loans depending on the risk profiles of borrowers and cosigners. Loans that 
have cosigners generally are priced significantly lower than those without cosigners. 
 
Banks should carefully balance pricing for risk and avoid errors that can threaten the 
portfolios and their performance. There are consequences if banks price below or above 
market. Any pricing above market could potentially create adverse selection, meaning only 
the least creditworthy private student loan borrowers apply. This happens because the lower-
risk borrowers take advantage of less costly financing options available to them. The highest-
risk borrowers apply for and accept retail credit at almost any rate. 
 
Often, banks offer borrower benefits such as an interest rate reduction when repayment 
begins. The interest rate reduction generally ranges between 25 and 100 basis points and is 
provided if certain conditions are met, including the borrowers agreeing to automatic debit 
payments from personal checking or savings accounts, the borrowers making specified 
consecutive on-time payments, the borrowers graduating or completing programs, or the 
existence of qualifying bank relationships. 
 
Examiners should assess whether the bank has well-defined underwriting criteria that 
establish prudent risk limits, including minimum credit scores, reasonable debt-to-income 
ratios, maximum loan amount and duration, and appropriate pricing. 
 
Other Requirements 
 
Except for continuing education loans, bank loans also require that borrowers be enrolled at 
least half time. In addition to credit qualification, private student loans are subject to 
completion of loan applications and consumer credit agreements, verification of application 
information, self-certification forms, and school certification. 
 
Through the school channel, colleges or universities certify the loans. School certification 
means that the school validates that the student has been accepted and will attend the school 
through which he or she is applying for the loan. Using the school channel ensures that the 
borrower obtains only funds necessary for his or her education and that funds are distributed 
directly to the school, not the borrower. School verification of application includes checking 
the accuracy of information reported by the student on the FAFSA and may include 
requesting a copy of the student’s tax returns and, if applicable, the student’s parents’ tax 
returns. 
 
Banks should ensure that funds are being used to pay for borrowers’ tuition and other 
education expenses. Most banks use the school channel instead of direct-to-consumer 
channel because the school channel is less susceptible to misuse of funds and fraud. Direct-
to-consumer loans generally do not require school certification and can result in borrowers 
applying for funds in excess of the cost. Banks that use the direct-to-consumer channel 
release private student loan funds directly to borrowers and lose control over use of the 
funds. 
 
Comptroller’s Handbook 
23 
Student Lending 
Introduction > Risk Management and Control Systems 
Banks are expected to follow applicable laws and regulations when underwriting and 
originating private student loans, including the following: 
 
• TILA: All disclosures are made in an accurate and timely manner, as required by TILA. 
• FCRA: A credit bureau report is requested only if there is a permissible purpose to 
request it under the FCRA. 
• ECOA: Loan programs must be administered in a nondiscriminatory manner (including 
marketing, underwriting, pricing, and servicing), and accurate and consistent adverse 
action treatment of all declined applications must be documented and followed as 
required by ECOA. 
• GLBA: Privacy notices are provided, and information sharing is limited, as required by 
GLBA. 
• EFTA: Electronic transfers of loan proceeds to consumers must comply with EFTA 
requirements. 
• Unfair or Deceptive Acts or Practices (UDAP) and Unfair, Deceptive, or Abusive 
Acts or Practices (UDAAP): All elements of marketing, underwriting, and origination 
must comply with the prohibitions on unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices 
contained in section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914 and Title X of 
Dodd–Frank.49 
 
Underwriting Exceptions 
 
Banks’ private student lending underwriting policies and criteria should reflect the banks’ 
stated risk appetites. Any underwriting exceptions could potentially change the risk profile of 
approved loans and the portfolios overall. The more discretion injected into the process, the 
higher the potential for exceptions. Policy exceptions generally are unavoidable because no 
underwriting policy is comprehensive enough to cover all possible situations. Banks should 
have the necessary MIS to identify and track exceptions. 
 
Banks should establish limitations for each type of exception and monitor adherence to those 
limits. Reports should track all exceptions to significant underwriting policy, scoring, 
documentation, and school eligibility requirements. Bank management should ensure that the 
information is regularly analyzed to determine causes and impacts, and, when necessary, 
implement corrective action. 
 
Examiners should assess whether banks’ private student loan MIS have adequate detail to 
facilitate analysis of exceptions overall and by type to determine if exceptions significantly 
affect the portfolios’ risk profiles. To make this determination, examiners should consider the 
exceptions’ volume and trends and the ongoing performance of loans originated with 
exceptions. If the performance of loans originated with exceptions is weaker than that of 
loans conforming to underwriting criteria, bank management should require stricter 
adherence to underwriting policy. If performance is better, bank management should 
consider revising bank policy.

the OCC’s guidance on unfair or deceptive acts or practices. 
Comptroller’s Handbook 
24 
Student Lending 
Introduction > Risk Management and Control Systems 
Exception and performance tracking should be sufficiently granular to enable the board and 
bank management to drill down into the sources of exceptions. By evaluating exceptions and 
subsequent performance by product, credit quality, school, channel, etc., bank management 
can target corrective action to the actual source of any problem. 
 
Loan Servicing and Administration 
 
Private student loan servicers are responsible for properly administering loans from 
origination through final payment. Banks or third parties perform student loan servicing. 
Using reliable third-party servicers can be an effective way to standardize procedures, 
facilitate growth, and minimize costs. Additionally, third-party servicers are more likely to 
have the scale, system infrastructure, and, in most cases, personnel experience to carry out 
any specialized student loan requirements (e.g., use of deferments and grace periods). Banks 
that use third-party servicers should ensure that loans are administered appropriately and 
comply with bank policies and procedures and applicable laws and regulations.50 Banks 
should follow the supervisory guidelines regarding risk management outlined in OCC 
Bulletin 2013-29, “Third-Party Relationships: Risk Management Guidance.” Banks’ risk 
management systems should reflect the complexity of banks’ third-party activities and the 
overall level of risk involved. 
 
The following terminology is commonly associated with repayment of student loans: 
 
• In-school period: The time during which the borrower is enrolled at least half time at an 
eligible school. The in-school period ends when the borrower graduates or leaves school, 
or when the borrower’s enrollment drops below half time.51 
• In-school deferment: A period during which no payment is required while the borrower 
is enrolled at a “qualifying” school, per the bank’s definition, as no less than a half-time 
student.52 
• Repayment period: The period during which payments of principal and interest are 
required. The repayment period typically follows any applicable in-school deferment or 
grace period. 
• Grace period: A standard six-month period after graduation or withdrawal from school 
during which no payment is required. This grace period may be automatically granted to 
a borrower who leaves school or drops below half time before repayment begins.53 
• Extended grace period: An additional, consecutive, one-time period during which no 
payment is required for up to six months after the initial grace period. An extended grace 
period typically is granted to the borrower who may be having difficulty finding

Management Guidance.”

employment before the repayment period starts. The extended grace period counts toward 
the maximum lifetime allowable payment forbearance of no more than 12 months.54 
 
Repayment Terms 
 
Banks generally offer various repayment options or repayment terms for student loans: 
 
• Immediate repayment: This repayment option requires the borrower to begin making 
principal and interest payments, usually no more than 60 days after the final disbursement 
date of the loan. 
• Deferred principal and interest: This option involves full deferment of principal and 
interest payments during school while capitalizing the accrued interest. Repayment 
begins six months after the earliest of (1) graduation, (2) the borrower ceasing to be 
enrolled in school, or (3) the borrower being enrolled less than half time. Banks generally 
have a limit on how long the deferment lasts, which is usually tied to the expected 
completion time period of the borrower’s education program. 
• Fully amortizing repayment: This option involves a periodic loan payment, part of 
which is principal and part of which is interest. If the borrower makes payments 
according to the loan’s amortization schedule, the loan will be paid off by the end of its 
term. The borrower and the bank generally are best served by amortizing repayments of 
principal and interest over a reasonable time period. 
• Graduated repayment: This repayment structure allows for lower monthly payments 
that gradually increase. Banks that offer this option at origination should follow safe and 
sound lending practices and regulatory principles outlined in OCC Bulletin 2015-7, 
“Interagency Guidance on Private Student Loans With Graduated Repayment Terms at 
Origination.” Banks may offer borrowers graduated repayment terms in addition to fixed 
amortizing terms and provide flexibility to repay the debt sooner if borrowers’ incomes 
increase more quickly than projected. When underwriting private student loans with 
graduated repayment, banks should consider aligning payment terms with the borrower’s 
income. Banks should establish the time period during which graduated repayment terms 
will be offered, usually at the beginning of the repayment period. 
• Interest only: Some banks may require some form of in-school repayment that includes 
full or nominal interest payment. Interest-only payments generally begin no more than 
60 days after the final disbursement date. 
 
Loan servicing includes all activities during the in-school, grace, and repayment periods. 
Loan servicing includes various activities, such as 
 
• verifying the borrower’s in-school status. 
• transitioning to loan repayment. 
• establishing repayment terms. 
• applying payments.

Comptroller’s Handbook 
26 
Student Lending 
Introduction > Risk Management and Control Systems 
• granting deferment and forbearance. 
• reporting loan information to credit bureaus. 
• responding to inquiries. 
 
The loan servicer receives and processes updated enrollment information through various 
processes, including certification from applications, deferment forms, letters from a school 
official, the National Student Loan Data System—Student Status Confirmation Report 
(NSLDS-SSCR)55 process, and direct communication from the school. When the loan 
servicer is notified that the borrower is no longer attending school or is not carrying the 
required credits, the borrower generally enters a grace period. The grace period is intended to 
provide the borrower with time to find employment and prepare to repay the loan. The 
borrower is generally allowed a six-month grace period before loan repayment begins. 
 
During the grace period, the loan servicer is generally expected to establish a relationship 
with the borrower to help the borrower understand his or her repayment status and 
obligations, promote any self-service payment option offered by the bank (e.g., online), and 
obtain updated borrower contact information. The loan servicer should help educate and 
inform the borrower regarding the tools and options available to assist him or her in 
managing the student loan and options to receive bill correspondence electronically. 
 
Management should ensure that loan servicers adhere to applicable federal laws and 
regulations, including the following: 
 
• ECOA (Regulation B) 
• EFTA (Regulation E) 
• FCRA (Regulation V) 
• FDCPA 
• “Privacy of Consumer Financial Information” (Regulation P) 
• USA PATRIOT Act 
• TILA (Regulation Z) 
• SCRA 
• MLA 
 
Because private student loans are unsecured debt and not federally guaranteed, loan servicers 
need to be highly proficient in ensuring that loans are properly originated and appropriately 
serviced. If banks use third-party servicers, these servicers generally indemnify banks and 
hold them harmless from liability for any deficiency in originating or servicing student loans. 
Indemnification is considered best practice when using third-party servicers. The strength of 
the indemnification is closely tied to the third party’s financial condition, and importantly, 
indemnification provisions are not a substitute for proper risk-management practices.

developed to provide loan-level information on Title IV loans and to provide an integrated view of other Title 
IV programs. NSLDS overall goals are to improve the quality and accessibility of student aid data, reduce the 
burden of administering Title IV aid, and minimize abuse within the aid programs through accurate tracking of 
funds awarded to assist the postsecondary students for whom the programs were designed. 
Comptroller’s Handbook 
27 
Student Lending 
Introduction > Risk Management and Control Systems 
Examiners should expect banks to have a sound third-party program that includes periodic 
due diligence, review, and monitoring. Banks should conduct periodic on-site third-party 
servicer audits to assess whether the third parties are adhering to the banks’ private student 
loan policies and procedures. Banks should have third-party metrics and appropriate MIS 
reports that include loan performance by third-party servicers. One of the key components of 
a third-party servicer program is a Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements 
Number 16 review (SSAE 16). This annual review helps monitor third-party servicers’ 
operational soundness and ability to comply with bank policies and procedures and 
applicable laws and regulations. Bank management should have appropriate processes and 
procedures when third-party servicers are given unacceptable or equivalent ratings during 
annual reviews. 
 
Bank management should be mindful of student loan servicing deficiencies highlighted by 
the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)56 in its annual ombudsman reports.57 
 
Collections 
 
In most banks, whether done in-house or through third parties, loan servicing is responsible 
for loan collections of private student loans. Loan servicers have specialized collections staff 
whose responsibilities may involve the collections of both private and federal guaranteed 
student loans. Whether private or federal, student loans are generally difficult to discharge in 
bankruptcy. There are time limits or statutes of limitations, however, on how long private 
student lenders can try to collect on the underlying debt. These time limits or statutes of 
limitation vary by state but are usually about three to six years.58 If banks sue and obtain 
court judgments, the banks may have from five to as many as 20 years to enforce court 
judgments. 
 
Because student loans are unsecured consumer debt, loan servicers should take appropriate 
steps to avoid loan defaults by borrowers. Delinquent loans should be actively managed and 
collections efforts effectively performed. Once loans enter the repayment phase, the 
servicers’ main objectives are to collect payments, pursue delinquent accounts, and minimize 
loan defaults while providing effective customer service. 
 
An effective student loan collection process is a key component of controlling and 
minimizing credit losses. Whether performed by a third party or in-house, the process should 
be guided by well-established policies and procedures and should be managed effectively at 
each stage for optimal and legal collection of principal and interest to occur. Private student 
loan servicers must adhere to the FDCPA, which prohibits abusive debt collection practices.

“appropriate recommendations” to the CFPB Director, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of 
Education, and Congress.

Student Lending 
Introduction > Risk Management and Control Systems 
The problems associated with an inadequately managed collection function include 
 
• reduced earnings caused by increased loan losses and reduced recoveries. 
• inaccurate or untimely communications to senior management and the directorate. 
• inaccurate reporting of past-due and charged-off loans, and imprudent management 
decisions. 
• insufficient allowance for loan losses caused by weak MIS, inaccurate past due figures, 
and the improper use of deferment, forbearance, and other collection-related practices. 
• inadequate audit trail of collection and recovery activities. 
• poorly trained employees, resulting in loss of productivity, collections, and recoveries. 
• violations of laws and regulations. 
 
Technology 
 
The loan collection function generally relies on automation and technology to be 
competitive, remain compliant, operate efficiently, and increase profitability. Banks and third 
parties generally use technology and historical information to formulate a plan or strategy for 
optimizing their collection efforts. Communication technology has grown in sophistication 
over time. This technology is used to leverage an integrated and multi-channel approach to 
borrower communication with voice alerts, outbound interactive voice response, predictive 
dialing, preview calling, e-mails, and custom websites. Even skip tracing techniques have 
evolved and use social media to locate borrowers. Whatever form of communication banks or 
third parties use to contact borrowers, privacy is a significant consideration. Banks must 
adhere to the FDCPA and other applicable laws and regulations, including state dialer and 
messaging restrictions, operator and consent rules, and rules addressing identification data 
blocks, drop rates, call times, and other subjects. 
 
In contrast with communication technology used in the loan collection function, the 
infrastructure used to administer and service private student loans has limited functionality. 
These are generally legacy systems designed primarily to support repayment options offered 
in the federal guaranteed loan programs.59 These platforms were not designed to 
accommodate TDR60 analysis and financial reporting requirements. Consequently, some 
workout options for private student loans (e.g., restructuring or modifications) would likely 
require platform technology enhancements. 
 
Examiners should have a general understanding of the technologies employed by in-house 
collection departments or third parties to evaluate their effectiveness. Bank management 
should appropriately oversee and govern third-party relationships, and there should be no 
                                                           
59 Examples include the Graduated Repayment Plan, Income-Contingent Repayment Term, Extended 
Repayment, and Income-Based Repayment. Refer to appendix E of this booklet for more information. 
 
60 Accounting Standards Codification Subtopic 310-40 states that a TDR is “a restructuring in which a bank, for 
economic or other reasons related to a borrower’s financial difficulties, grants a concession to the borrower that 
it would not otherwise consider.” Accounting Standards Codification 310-40-15-9 states that a TDR includes “a 
modification of the loan terms, such as a reduction of the stated interest rate, principal, or accrued interest or an 
extension of the maturity date at a stated interest rate lower than the current market rate for new debt with 
similar risk.” 
Comptroller’s Handbook 
29 
Student Lending 
Introduction > Risk Management and Control Systems 
gaps in banks’ information technology risk management programs. If loan servicers are using 
work-arounds to adhere to requirements of TDR enhanced accounting and reporting, 
examiners should ensure that the banks have the appropriate internal controls. 
 
Collection Strategies 
 
Collection strategies determine which accounts are put in collection queues, the timing of 
collection activities, and the type of contact (e.g., phone calls, collection letters, and legal 
letters). Seasonality is a factor in private student loan collections. Borrowers who graduate in 
December begin repayment after the six-month grace period. That is why many accounts 
enter first payment default between May and June. By the same token, borrowers who 
graduate in May enter the collection queue in the fourth quarter of the year. Bank 
management should adjust its collection strategies and staffing to accommodate this 
seasonality. 
 
Most banks with effective loan collection units engage in delinquency prevention. Some of 
the most common strategies they employ are the following: 
 
• Early withdrawal strategy: Banks send high-level e-mails and perform outbound calls 
to borrowers who withdrew from school and provide counseling on repayment options 
during the grace period. The goal of the strategy is to reduce loan defaults for this 
population. 
• Pre-repayment strategy: Banks generally make outbound calls to borrowers who 
recently graduated and borrowers coming out of forbearance. These calls educate 
customers on the amount and due date of their payments, methods of payment, and bank 
contact information (e.g., website, e-mail, phone number, and address). This strategy is 
also helpful in determining if skip tracing is necessary. 
 
Another consideration in private student loan collection is borrower mobility. New graduates 
may move immediately after graduation or separation from school. Banks recognize that 
some student loan defaults result from failure to locate borrowers or otherwise having no 
contact with borrowers. Default and debt management programs can work only when banks 
can locate borrowers. Pre-repayment strategies that include soliciting updated borrower and 
cosigner information, including cellphone numbers, have proved to be effective. These 
efforts help borrowers transition from deferment and the grace period into making payments. 
 
In many banks, collection strategies rely on behavior scoring models to segment accounts by 
risk. Transaction analytics also help in developing effective behavior score models that adapt 
or adjust to portfolio changes. High-risk accounts should have higher collection phone call 
attempts and customer contacts to increase likelihood of collection. Banks use behavior score 
models to predict likelihood of collection and to more precisely alter banks’ actions and 
timing for collection activity. Banks use analytics and segmentation to determine not only the 
appropriate collection action but also whether to send accounts to third-party collection 
agencies and at what point to do so. Examiners should review and discuss with bank 
management the collection strategies and reports generated. Banks should maintain close 
Comptroller’s Handbook 
30 
Student Lending 
Introduction > Risk Rating and Examiner Guidance 
control over their collection strategies and understand the impact of strategy changes to 
dollars collected. 
 
Supervision of collection staff is important. Bank management should ensure that collection 
supervisors have appropriate collections experience and good management skills. Bank 
management should align incentives with collection goals and collector performance 
measures, and should require that collection supervisors regularly review the collectors’ 
performance. Collection activities should be subject to regular quality assurance and internal 
audit review. 
 
Internal Audit 
 
Because of the variety of risks inherent in private student lending activities, internal audit 
coverage should include evaluating all the risks and controls in the bank’s private student 
lending operations. The scope and frequency of these audits should be based on the risk of 
associated controls and complexity of banks’ private student lending activities. Internal audit 
staff should be able to identify control breakdowns and ensure appropriate remediation. 
Internal audit should assess strategic business risks and the overall risk management 
framework, including complying with bank policies, approved practices and limits, and 
applicable laws and regulations. Internal audit staff should be independent and 
knowledgeable about private student lending activities. 
 
Staff should report audit findings, including identified control weaknesses, to the board or a 
designated committee. The board and bank management should ensure that the internal audit 
staff has the necessary qualifications and expertise to review private student lending 
activities. 
 
Risk Rating and Examiner Guidance 
 
Classification and Charge-Off Policies 
 
Private student loan account classification and charge-off practices are addressed in OCC 
Bulletin 2000-20, “Uniform Retail Credit Classification and Account Management Policy: 
Policy Implementation.” In general, under this policy, private student loans that reach 
90 days past due are classified “substandard,” and loans that become 120 days past due are 
classified as a loss and charged off. The guidance includes special rules for bankrupt, 
fraudulent, and deceased borrower accounts, and examiners should review this bulletin 
closely before considering banks’ collection activities. 
 
For private student loans, just because loans are classified as a loss or charged off does not 
mean that the lender should stop using workout or modification programs or that loss 
mitigation or collection efforts should cease, unless prohibited by law. It simply means that 
for safety and soundness reasons and financial and investor transparency, banks should 
follow appropriate accounting practices.

MIS for Collections 
 
The volume and trends in delinquencies and losses are central to evaluating collections and 
overall portfolio performance. Robust, timely MIS reporting identifies loans or portfolio 
segments that are not performing as expected and helps bank management understand 
portfolio quality. The bank’s set of MIS reports on private student loans should give bank 
management a view of loans that are in repayment, as well as the range of loss mitigation and 
collection activities in which the bank engages. The reports should provide bank 
management with a comprehensive and accurate view of the portfolio’s risk including 
tracking effectiveness of the bank’s forbearance, workout, and modification programs. 
 
Through bank MIS reports, bank management should be able to isolate key products, product 
combinations, and borrower characteristics to help understand which factors drive 
performance. Besides helping management track portfolio performance against expectations, 
bank MIS reports should assist in understanding policy limitations and enable management to 
benchmark against industry metrics. 
 
MIS reports should not only support the collection process but also help ensure timely 
recognition of losses. 
 
Because of the nature of student loans, there could be a significant time lag between the 
disbursement of loan funds and the start of repayment. Therefore, any private student loan 
MIS should provide portfolio metrics that clearly distinguish the account status (in repayment 
versus deferment). 
 
Equally or even more important, MIS reports should help bank management understand the 
factors influencing portfolio performance (e.g., underwriting, marketing, and collection 
staffing). Understanding these factors promotes a more realistic assessment of portfolio 
performance as well as an accurate evaluation of the workload and effectiveness of the 
bank’s collection function. MIS helps ensure that remedial actions implemented are properly 
constructed to address the problem rather than a symptom. For example, private student loan 
MIS should have appropriate segmentation and granularity necessary to monitor performance 
for each school or education program based on delinquencies and losses. This granularity of 
MIS reports helps bank management evaluate school relationships and terminate poorly 
performing relationships and programs when necessary. 
 
The roll rate report,61 for example, allows bank management to review the number and dollar 
volume of accounts that move from current to 30-days delinquent, 30- to 60-days, etc. This 
information helps management to predict the charge-off rate as far as six months into the 
future. In addition, this report can aid management decisions regarding collection staffing 
levels. 
 
                                                           
61 Roll rates measure the movement of accounts and balances from one payment status to another (e.g., 
percentage of accounts or dollars that were current last month rolling to 30 days past due this month).

Examiners should evaluate the bank’s MIS for timely, accurate, relevant, and effective 
information and should strongly criticize the absence of appropriate tracking and monitoring 
reports. 
 
Workout Program and Debt Management 
 
The Education Department allows several repayment and debt management62 alternatives for 
financially distressed borrowers with federal student loans. These repayment alternatives 
include extended repayment plans such as graduated repayment, income-contingent 
repayment term, extended repayment, and income-based repayment. Debt forgiveness is 
another alternative. Some of these alternatives may not be appropriate for private student 
loans and may not be consistent with safe and sound banking principles. The Education 
Department defines federal student loan default as 270 days past due, compared with 
120 days past due for banks’ private student loans. The Education Department also allows 
loan deferment due to unemployment for a maximum of three years. These Education 
Department programs and practices have brought pressure to banks to align their repayment 
and workout programs for private student loans to those of federal student loans. Banks have 
some latitude to offer similar federal workout programs to private student loans. Banks, 
however, should do so while adhering to safety and soundness requirements and following 
existing banking guidance and GAAP. 
 
Two OCC issuances provide guidance related to student loan deferment, forbearance, and 
modifications. First, OCC Bulletin 2000-20, “Uniform Retail Credit Classification and 
Account Management Policy: Policy Implementation,” provides general guidance on 
classifying retail credits for regulatory purposes and establishing policies for working with 
borrowers experiencing temporary financial difficulties. Second, the examiner guidance, 
CNBE Policy Guidance 2010-2 (REV), “Policy Interpretation: OCC Bulletin 2000-20—
Application to Private Student Lending,” affirms the applicability and fundamental principles 
of the Retail Classification Policy to private student lending while recognizing the unique 
aspects of higher education financing.63 
 
OCC Bulletin 2000-20 and CNBE Policy Guidance 2010-2 (REV) address supervisory 
expectations for risk management of loan workout programs and arrangements, classification 
of loans, and regulatory reporting and accounting considerations. Examiners and bankers 
should remember that workout programs can be used to help borrowers overcome temporary 
financial difficulties, if those actions 
 
• do not cloud the true performance and delinquency status of the portfolio. 
• are reported accurately for call report and financial reporting purposes. 
• are based on the borrower’s renewed willingness and ability to repay the loan. 
• are structured and controlled in accordance with sound internal policies. 
 
                                                           
62 Workout programs are commonly referred to as “debt management” in the student lending industry. 
 
63 This policy guidance previously was available only internally to OCC employees and is being made public 
with this booklet. 
Comptroller’s Handbook 
33 
Student Lending 
Introduction > Risk Rating and Examiner Guidance 
Bank management should note that regulatory agencies encourage financial institutions to 
work constructively with private student loan borrowers experiencing financial difficulties 
and should consider workout arrangements that increase the potential for such borrowers to 
repay private student loans whenever workout arrangements are economically feasible and 
appropriate.64 Banks should adopt their own standards for workouts and modifications and 
monitor the effectiveness of those standards. Banks should provide clear and practical 
information to student loan borrowers that explains the options available, general eligibility 
criteria, the process for requesting workouts, and information on how to contact lenders or 
loan servicers. 
 
There are several repayment assistance remedies unique to private student loans, some of 
which are described in this section. 
 
Deferment 
 
In-school deferment is a temporary postponement of payments while borrowers are attending 
school (enrolled at least half time). Repayment of private student loans generally begins 
60 days after disbursement. Most borrowers opt for in-school deferment of principal and 
interest. During this period, the interest is capitalized and added to the principal balance of 
the loan. Repayment then begins six months after graduation, when borrowers are no longer 
enrolled in school, or when borrowers are enrolled less than half time. Banks tie the length of 
deferment to the expected completion time of borrowers’ education programs. Deferment 
should not affect other terms of the loan, including maturity. 
 
Six-month grace is a standard period after graduation or withdrawal from school during 
which no payment is required, as interest continues to be capitalized. This grace period is 
automatically granted to borrowers who leave school or drop below half time before 
repayment begins. This grace period is ordinarily granted without conditions or 
documentation of any hardship. During the grace period, banks should contact borrowers to 
counsel them on repayment terms, the repayment process, and repayment responsibilities to 
ensure orderly transition to repayment. 
 
Forbearance and Extension 
 
Forbearance permits borrowers to temporarily postpone making payments or reduce the 
amount of payments for a limited and specific period if borrowers are unable to make the 
scheduled loan payments for reasons including temporary financial hardship. Borrowers are 
liable for the interest that accrues on loans during the forbearance period. Forbearance is 
granted at banks’ discretion. Private student loans with repayment terms of 10 years or 
greater may have no more than 12 months of payment forbearance over the loans’ terms. 
Banks should establish a lesser limit for loans with terms of less than 10 years. 
 
Banks should consider granting forbearances for private student loans in one- or two-month 
increments, with three- to six-month forbearance terms granted only in exceptional

Introduction > Risk Rating and Examiner Guidance 
circumstances. There should be a 12-month period of positive payment performance before 
borrowers are eligible for subsequent forbearance. The two types of forbearance that banks 
should consider as possible remedies for short-term borrower hardship are extended grace 
and extensions. Both forbearance actions are consistent with existing OCC guidance. 
 
• Extended grace is the period immediately after the grace period during which borrowers 
experiencing financial hardship are allowed an additional grace period of up to six 
months. Extended grace may be granted with appropriate documentation and gives 
borrowers a total of up to 12 months after graduation or withdrawal from school to obtain 
employment (grace period plus extended grace period) and begin repayment.65 
Examiners should assess whether banks contact borrowers to document and support the 
hardship requiring this forbearance option, establish borrowers’ commitment to repay the 
debt, and evaluate the reasonableness of borrowers’ prospective repayment capacity after 
the extended grace period. 
• Extension is a form of forbearance used to roll back the maturity of loans by a specified 
number of months (e.g., one or two months). Accounts are shown to be current upon 
granting extensions. 
 
The extended grace period and all extensions should count toward the maximum lifetime 
allowable payment forbearance of no more than 12 months. The limits on extensions are 
calculated on a per-loan basis. Management should consider incremental approval of the 
extended grace period and document ongoing conversations with borrowers to determine if 
borrowers have established means to repay the debt. Banks should notify cosigners of the 
approval of any extended grace period or other payment forbearance. 
 
Examiners should assess whether bank practices that defer the start of the repayment period 
are well controlled, supported, and documented to prevent the inappropriate deferral of loss 
recognition in problem situations. Short-term forbearance for temporary hardship is typically 
not considered a TDR. A determination, however, should be made if a TDR exists if the 
modification is significant to the term, contractual balance, or other characteristics of the 
loan, and consistent with GAAP. 
 
Military Deferment and Forbearance 
 
In the case of an in-school military deferment, members of the military attending school 
(enrolled at least half time) and called into active duty66 or qualifying National Guard duty67 
should be allowed deferment in increments of 12 months (maximum of 36 months). 
                                                           
65 CNBE Policy Guidance 2010-2 (REV), “Policy Interpretation: OCC Bulletin 2000-20—Application to 
Private Student Lending.” 
 
66 The term “active duty” is defined in 10 USC 101(d)(1). Also refer to 10 USC 688 12301(a), 10 USC 688 
12301(g), 10 USC 12302, and 10 USC 12304. 
 
67 Qualifying National Guard duty refers to activation, reassignment, and full-time duty in connection with war, 
contingency operation, or national emergency. Refer to 10 USC 12301. The term “National Guard duty” is 
defined in 10 USC 101(d)(1), 10 USC 101(d)(3), and 10 USC 101(d)(5). 
Comptroller’s Handbook 
35 
Student Lending 
Introduction > Risk Rating and Examiner Guidance 
Examiners should assess whether banks review borrowers’ military status after each 12-
month deferment term. 
 
For borrowers who are out of school, in repayment status, and called into active duty or 
qualifying National Guard duty, banks may grant a similar 12-month deferment (maximum 
of 36 months) on an exception basis recognizing the borrowers’ reduced capacity to repay. 
 
For military deferment and forbearance, examiners should verify whether bank management 
 
• checks active duty papers to confirm mobilization or call to active duty.68 
• provides the borrower education and counseling that include disclosure of capitalization 
of interest and non-waiver of principal during forbearance to both borrowers and 
cosigners. 
• monitors and tracks military forbearance granted with appropriate internal controls, MIS, 
and quality assurance. 
 
Additionally, banks must follow laws and regulations, including the SCRA, that apply to 
service members. This law provides various civil protections and rights to service members. 
Among the protections is a 6 percent interest rate cap on pre-service debts69 and restrictions 
on default judgments against members in active duty military service. The U.S. Department 
of Justice may pursue enforcement actions for SCRA claims against lenders through the 
agency’s Civil Rights Division. Similarly, the OCC may consider what supervisory response, 
including taking an enforcement action, is appropriate if one of its supervised banks violates 
the SCRA. 
 
Long-Term Hardship 
 
Banks should work with borrowers experiencing long-term financial hardship in a 
constructive way. For long-term hardships, banks may temporarily or permanently offer 
workout programs that include modification or restructure. Private student loans, however, 
should not be treated differently from other retail loans. The terms of any workout programs 
should be consistent with the nature of borrowers’ hardship, have sustainable payment 
requirements, and promote orderly, systematic repayment of amounts owed. Banks should 
structure workout terms based on borrowers’ and cosigners’ (if any) renewed willingness and 
ability to repay the loans. Banks should be cautioned against workouts that suspend 
repayment for protracted periods without sufficient documentation of borrowers’ hardship or 
willingness and reasonably expected ability to repay. Workouts should be controlled in 
accordance with sound bank workout policies. 
 
                                                           
68 Banks may review call to active duty beginning and end date or access the U.S. Department of Defense 
database. 
 
69 Pursuant to 50 USC 3937 (SCRA), “Maximum Rate of Interest on Debts Incurred Before Military Service,” 
the term “interest” includes service charges, renewal charges, fees, or any other charges (except bona fide 
insurance) with respect to an obligation or liability. 
Comptroller’s Handbook 
36 
Student Lending 
Introduction > Risk Rating and Examiner Guidance 
For long-term hardships, banks may temporarily or permanently reduce the interest rate to 
lower borrowers’ payments. Any temporary reduction in borrowers’ interest rates should 
provide reasonable transitions back to the contract rate to avoid payment shock. Conversely, 
extensions of loan terms or allowing non-amortizing payments or balloon payments at 
maturity are generally not appropriate actions for long-term hardships because there has not 
been any demonstrated ability by borrowers to repay. 
 
In determining whether to criticize banks with troubled private student loans, examiners 
should consider whether banks have offered appropriate modifications to borrowers, 
including restructured loans that result in adverse credit classifications or TDR under GAAP. 
By the same token, potential or actual treatment as a TDR should not prevent banks from 
proactively working with borrowers to restructure loans with reasonable modified terms. 
Consideration and evaluation of cosigners and guarantors should guide the decision and 
selection of the best borrower option. Any private student loan restructure should be 
supported by a current, well-documented credit evaluation of borrowers’ and cosigners’ (if 
any) financial condition and prospects for repayment under the revised terms. 
 
Banks should evaluate whether restructured private student loans should be reported as a 
TDR. Not all modifications of loan terms, however, automatically result in a TDR. For 
example, if the modified terms are consistent with market conditions and representative of 
terms that borrowers could obtain in the open market given similar credit characteristics, the 
restructured loan is not considered a TDR.70 
 
For reporting purposes, a restructured loan is considered a TDR when banks, for economic or 
legal reasons related to borrowers’ financial difficulties, grant concessions to borrowers in 
modifying or renewing loans that the banks would not otherwise consider. Modifications of 
loan terms, such as extensions of the maturity date or reductions of the stated interest rate 
lower than the current market rate for new debt with similar risk, are considered concessions 
and qualify as a restructuring under GAAP. Private student loans that have undergone TDRs 
in compliance with their modified terms should be reported as restructured loans in schedule 
RC-C, part I, memorandum item 1, of the call report. 
 
Additionally, banks should evaluate whether accrual of interest remains appropriate for 
private student loan TDRs. Non-accrual reporting status for individual private student loans 
is not specifically required, but banks should take steps to ensure that the net income is not 
materially overstated. 
 
Guidance on reporting TDRs, including characteristics of modifications, is included in the 
Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) call report instructions and OCC 
Bulletin 2012-10, “Troubled Debt Restructurings: Supervisory Guidance on Accounting and 
Reporting Requirements.”

Introduction > Risk Rating and Examiner Guidance 
Examination Considerations 
 
Standards, policies, and procedures: When examining banks’ student lending workout 
programs, examiners should understand the different workout arrangements and determine if 
banks have prudent workout standards and eligibility criteria that control the use of and limit 
the number and frequency of forbearances, extensions, deferments, and modifications. The 
standards should prohibit any additional advances to finance unpaid interest and fees. 
Examiners should assess whether banks have 
 
• standards, policies, and procedures that determine borrowers’ financial condition and 
overall capacity to repay through evaluation of income, employment, and other debts. 
• approval and reporting requirements. 
• program eligibility criteria tailored toward borrowers’ financial difficulty, including 
temporary, short-term, or long-term difficulty. 
 
Examiners should assess bank practices by (1) reviewing the analysis that supports the 
banks’ decision to offer workout arrangements, and (2) evaluating whether banks adhere to 
their standards, policies, and procedures. Examiners should evaluate whether banks consider 
the nature of borrower hardship and whether there is a reasonable basis to support repayment 
in the future. Examiners should sample several accounts to ensure that bank workout 
practices adhere to bank policy and that bank practices and policy are consistent with OCC 
guidance. 
 
Documentation and MIS: Banks’ decisions to grant deferment, forbearance, extension, 
modification, or any other workout arrangement should be supported in the banks’ MIS. 
Bank documentation should show that there was communication between the borrowers and 
the banks and that borrowers have the ability to repay the loans. Examiners should review 
bank MIS and evaluate if banks have adequate MIS that identify and document any private 
student loans placed in workout programs, including the number of times such action has 
been taken. 
 
Management oversight: There are risks in lax management supervision of workout 
programs, including accumulation of problem accounts and understatement of portfolio 
delinquencies, charge-offs, and provisions. Banks should control and manage the volume and 
complexity of workout programs including following regulatory reporting and GAAP 
requirements. Banks should have an allowance for loan and lease losses (ALLL) 
methodology that is consistent with GAAP and recognizes credit losses in a timely manner 
through provisions and charge-offs. 
 
Management should monitor and track the volume and performance of loans that have been 
placed in workout arrangements and measure the effectiveness of programs over time (e.g.,  
Comptroller’s Handbook 
38 
Student Lending 
Introduction > Risk Rating and Examiner Guidance 
percentage of accounts that cure and charge off). The outcome should justify the practice. For 
workout programs to be effective, banks may consider 
 
• tracking the 13-month rolling volume of loans (number and dollar amounts) that were 
placed into deferment, extension, forbearance, etc., by month and monitoring this long 
term (e.g., last three years). 
• monitoring performance for each deferment or forbearance since the deferment or 
forbearance arrangement ended. 
• tracking historical performance by repayment vintage and even grouping this by accounts 
that received different types of workout since entering repayment. 
• monitoring average credit score of accounts in forbearance or repayment (dollar 
weighted) and comparing this with the average credit score for new volume. 
 
Consolidation and Refinance 
 
Some banks offer consolidation and refinance loans to borrowers who wish to simplify and 
streamline their repayment efforts. Consolidation allows borrowers to combine private 
student loans into single fixed-rate consolidation loans (or variable rate, if preferred), thus 
providing single due dates and billing statements. If primary borrowers’ credit profiles have 
improved significantly, the primary borrowers may qualify for better rates and may remove 
the cosigners (if any) from individual loans. Consolidation and refinance may be used to 
switch lenders and enable borrowers to shop for the best possible loan term and pricing. 
 
Banks should exercise caution when offering consolidation of both federal and private 
student loans. Borrowers who refinance federal student loans into private student loans may 
lose favorable benefits from the original federal student loans (e.g., Perkins loan subsidized 
interest and loan forgiveness). Banks may consider helping borrowers determine if 
consolidation provides the expected benefit. 
 
In general, both federal and private student loans cannot be discharged in bankruptcy. Still, in 
determining whether student loans are protected against discharge (pursuant to 
11 USC 523(a)(8)(B)), banks should consider whether the loans meet the definition of 
“qualified education loan.”71 The student loan debt should be incurred within “a reasonable 
period”72 with the debt attributable to education furnished during a period in which the 
borrowers were eligible students. 
 
Recoveries 
 
Recoveries are collection activities after accounts are charged off. Student loans are rarely 
permitted to be discharged in bankruptcy, which allows lenders to pursue recoveries from 
borrowers for longer periods if banks seek and obtain court judgments against borrowers. 
                                                           
71 A bankruptcy discharge exception is applied to qualified education loans in 11 USC 523(a)(8)(B), 
“Exceptions to Discharge.” 
 
72 The term “reasonable period” is defined in 26 CFR 1.221-1(e)(3)(ii), “Deduction for Interest Paid on 
Qualified Education Loans After December 31, 2001.” 
Comptroller’s Handbook 
39 
Student Lending 
Introduction > Risk Rating and Examiner Guidance 
Similar with other retail loan products, recovery activities for private student loans are 
generally conducted internally and may be outsourced to collection agencies after several 
months. Collection agencies receive a percentage of the dollars collected, and the percentage 
varies based on whether the agency is the primary (the first agency to work the accounts), 
secondary, or tertiary collector. The primary agency generally collects the lowest percentage, 
and the tertiary agency collects the highest percentage. 
 
Some of the factors that may affect the recovery rate are 
 
• previous collection efforts. 
• depth and experience of staff. 
• adequacy of systems and controls. 
• use of technology. 
 
When the bank selects an agency with which the bank will outsource accounts, the bank 
should perform appropriate due diligence to ensure that the agency is, among other things, 
properly licensed and bonded. The bank should have systems to monitor the agency 
continuously to ensure the agency is operating in a prudent manner. Bank management 
should follow the guidance outlined in OCC Bulletin 2013-29, “Third-Party Relationships: 
Risk Management Guidance,” as the bank works with third parties to collect accounts. 
 
Allowance and Capital Treatment 
 
For performing private student loans, bank management should establish appropriate ALLL 
levels that consider the credit quality of the portfolios and conditions that affect 
collectability. Most banks provide for at least one year of projected losses for their consumer 
portfolios, though the coverage period may be shorter or longer based on portfolio 
characteristics and performance. If the methodology and assumptions used are sound, the 
analysis of the credit quality of the portfolios and conditions for collectability determines the 
appropriate level and coverage of ALLL. Banks that engage in private student lending 
activities must comply with the OCC’s risk-based capital and leverage ratio requirements that 
apply to those activities. 
 
All private student loans whose terms have been modified in a TDR should be evaluated for 
impairment under Accounting Standards Codification Topic 310-10. Private student loans 
that have been modified in a TDR are impaired when, based on analysis of current 
information and events, it is probable that the bank will be unable to collect all amounts due 
(i.e., both principal and interest) according to the contractual terms of the original loan 
agreements. When the review of impaired private student loans confirms that a specific 
restructured loan is uncollectable, the amount that is uncollectable should be charged off. 
 
Banks with federal guaranteed student loan portfolios on their balance sheets should account 
for the portion of the loans not covered by the guarantee in the banks’ ALLL and regulatory 
capital. When government-guaranteed loans become 120 days past due, a dollar-for-dollar 
reserve should be established for the unguaranteed portion and reported accurately for call 
report and financial reporting purposes. For the purposes of capital, the guaranteed portion of 
Comptroller’s Handbook 
40 
Student Lending 
Introduction > Risk Rating and Examiner Guidance 
federal student loans is subject to a risk weight of 20 percent as a conditional guarantee of the 
U.S. government while the remaining unguaranteed 0 percent to 3 percent should be risk 
weighted at 100 percent. Private student loans that are 90 days past due have a general risk 
weight of 150 percent.73 
 
For more information on allowance, refer to OCC Bulletin 2006-47, “Allowance for Loan 
and Lease Losses (ALLL): Guidance and Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) on the 
ALLL,” and the OCC’s Bank Accounting Advisory Series. 
 
Rehabilitated Federal Student Loans 
 
Bank participation in the student lending industry is not simply confined to the “originate and 
hold” model. In the past few years, some community banks found new opportunities by 
purchasing pools (“buy and hold”) of student loans in the Federal Rehabilitation Student 
Loan Program. The program is made up of federal student loans with borrowers who 
previously defaulted but have brought the loans current with nine consecutive payments. 
 
Federal student loans generally fall into default after borrowers miss 270 days of loan 
payments (if payments are due monthly) or 330 days of loan payments (if payments are due 
less frequently).74 The Education Department offers a federal student loan rehabilitation 
program to help borrowers bring education loans out of default through affordable payments. 
Rehabilitation is a one-time opportunity to remove a federal student loan default from a 
borrower’s credit history and to regain student aid eligibility. To rehabilitate a federal student 
loan, the borrower must make nine on-time,75 full monthly payments to the guarantor or its 
contracted vendor during a period of 10 consecutive months. Payments must be made 
voluntarily by the borrower and must be equal to or greater than the amount determined to be 
reasonable and affordable. The definition of “voluntary” in this context excludes payments 
made by garnishment or other offsets. After the borrower makes nine of 10 consecutive 
payments and applies for and receives “rehabilitation,” the borrower will no longer be 
considered in default. 
 
A rehabilitated loan retains the same interest rate and deferment provisions that were 
applicable when the loan was first disbursed and keeps repayment terms and all other 
benefits applicable to other federal student loans. The borrower, however, regains eligibility 
for deferment only to the extent that he or she has not already exhausted those deferment 
privileges before the initial default. For example, a borrower who was initially eligible for 
24 months of unemployment deferment, and who used 12 months of that eligibility before his 
or her default, would be eligible to defer the rehabilitated loan for only 12 months due to any 
future unemployment status. 
 
                                                           
73 Refer to 12 CFR 3, subpart D (12 CFR 3.30–3.63), “Risk-Weighted Assets–Standardized Approach.” The 
OCC adopted the revised capital rules as final on July 9, 2013 (78 Fed. Reg. 62018 [October 11, 2013]). 
 
74 Refer to 34 CFR 682.200(b), “Definitions.” 
 
75 The term “on-time payment” is defined as payments within 20 days of the due date for FFELP and Direct 
Loan Program loans and 15 days for Perkins loans. 
Comptroller’s Handbook 
41 
Student Lending 
Introduction > Risk Rating and Examiner Guidance 
Once loans are redeemed, they are removed from collections and either returned to the 
original federal student loan servicers or purchased by eligible lending institutions. 
Rehabilitation of FFELP loans usually requires that the loans be sold to lenders after the 
borrowers complete the steps required to rehabilitate the loans. Community banks that buy 
these pools of loans generally receive a 2 percent to 3 percent discount and use third parties 
for servicing and administration. This new business is attractive to community banks because 
the government guarantees 97 percent to 100 percent of the principal of each loan. 
 
Rehabilitated FFELP loan pools are expected to have a higher net loss rate compared with 
pools of non-rehabilitated FFELP loans because, although the rehabilitated loans benefit 
from the same degree of federal guarantee, they are expected to default at a significantly 
higher rate than non-rehabilitated loans. Bank management should ensure that the bank is 
indemnified from any loan servicer errors and can adequately manage the risks, such as third-
party, liquidity, interest rate, compliance, and reputation risk. 
 
Examiners should assess whether banks that buy these pools have a thorough understanding 
of the risks associated with the portfolios. To most community banks, engaging in 
rehabilitated FFELP is a new activity. Community bank examiners should closely monitor 
how effectively banks manage this program.

Examination Procedures 
 
This booklet contains expanded procedures for examining specialized activities or specific 
products or services that warrant extra attention beyond the core assessment contained in the 
“Community Bank Supervision,” “Large Bank Supervision,” and “Federal Branches and 
Agencies Supervision” booklets of the Comptroller’s Handbook. Examiners determine which 
expanded procedures to use, if any, during examination planning or after drawing 
preliminary conclusions during the core assessment. 
 
Scope 
 
These procedures are designed to help examiners tailor the examination to each bank and 
determine the scope of the student lending examination. This determination should consider 
work performed by internal and external auditors and other independent risk control 
functions and by other examiners on related areas. Examiners need to perform only those 
objectives and steps that are relevant to the scope of the examination as determined by the 
following objective. Seldom will every objective or step of the expanded procedures be 
necessary. 
 
The scope of student lending supervisory activities depends on the examiner’s knowledge of 
those activities, the amount of total and product exposure, and the amount of risk posed to the 
bank’s earnings and capital. 
 
This booklet provides two sets of procedures: primary and supplemental. 
 
The “Primary Examination Procedures” section in this booklet discusses the steps necessary 
for a comprehensive student lending examination in smaller or less complex operations and 
serves as the base student lending procedures for larger or more complex operations. 
 
The “Supplemental Examination Procedures” section in this booklet discusses when 
examiners should expand the scope of the examination. For example, it may be necessary to 
supplement primary procedures when the bank offers new or significantly changed products, 
when a particular concern exists, or when examining larger, more complex operations. The 
supplemental examination procedures are grouped by functional areas. Examiners are 
encouraged to refer to other Comptroller’s Handbook booklets, including the following: 
 
• “Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses” 
• “Community Bank Supervision” 
• “Concentrations of Credit” 
• “Internal and External Audits” 
• “Internal Control” 
• “Large Bank Supervision” 
• “Loan Portfolio Management” 
• “Rating Credit Risk”

Student Lending 
Examination Procedures > Scope 
In connection with evaluating compliance with applicable laws, examiners are also 
encouraged to refer to appropriate booklets in the Consumer Compliance series of the 
Comptroller’s Handbook, such as the “Truth in Lending Act,” “Other Consumer Protection 
Laws and Regulations,” and “Fair Lending” booklets. Based on the facts and circumstances 
of each bank, examiners should select the appropriate expanded procedures, internal control 
questionnaire (ICQ), or verification procedures to supplement the minimum procedures. 
 
While reviewing student lending activities, examiners should remain alert for lending 
practices and product terms that could indicate discriminatory, unfair, deceptive, abusive, or 
predatory issues. 
 
Objective: To determine the scope of the examination of student lending and identify examination 
objectives and activities necessary to meet the bank’s supervisory strategy needs. 
 
1. Review the following sources of information and note any previously identified problems 
related to student lending that require follow-up: 
 
• Supervisory strategy 
• Examiner-in-charge’s (EIC) scope memorandum 
• The OCC’s information system 
• Previous reports of examination (ROE) and work papers 
• Internal and external audit reports and work papers, including Education 
Department’s lender servicer review report 
• Bank management’s responses to previous ROEs and audit reports 
• Borrower complaints and litigation 
 
2. Obtain the results of the Uniform Bank Performance Report and the OCC’s Canary 
benchmark report. 
 
3. Obtain and review the policies, procedures, and reports bank management uses to 
supervise student lending, including internal risk assessments. 
 
4. In discussions with bank management, determine if there have been any significant 
changes (for example, in policies, processes, personnel, control systems, products, 
volumes, markets, and geographies) since the previous examination of student lending. 
 
5. Based on an analysis of information obtained in the previous steps, as well as EIC input, 
determine the scope and objectives of the student lending examination. 
 
6. In preparing for the student lending examination, write a request letter as directed by the 
EIC (refer to this booklet’s appendix B, “Sample Request Letter”). 
 
7. Select from the following primary and supplementary examination procedures the 
necessary steps to meet examination objectives and the supervisory strategy.

Examination Procedures > Primary Examination Procedures 
Primary Examination Procedures 
 
The primary examination procedures provide the steps necessary for a comprehensive 
student lending examination in smaller or less complex operations and serve as the base 
student lending procedures for larger or more complex operations. The procedures include 
in-depth portfolio analysis and testing to promote examiners’ assessments of the quantity, 
aggregate level, and direction of credit risk. 
 
Note: If the National Credit Tool is available, examiners are encouraged to use the standard 
retail reports and the tool’s other capabilities (i.e., custom reports and sampling) to assist in 
the student lending examination procedures. 
 
Objective: To assess the level of risk, evaluate the quality of risk management, and determine the 
aggregate level and direction of risk of the bank’s student lending activities. 
 
1. Review the scope, conclusions, and work papers from previous supervisory activities. 
Determine the adequacy and timeliness of management’s response to the issues identified 
and any findings or issues requiring follow-up. 
 
2. Review relevant reports issued by internal and external audit, quality assurance, loan 
review, risk management, and compliance management since the previous supervisory 
activity. Determine the adequacy and timeliness of management’s responses to the issues 
identified and any findings or issues requiring follow-up. Request work papers, if 
warranted. 
 
3. Review the minutes of student lending-related management and board meetings 
conducted since the previous supervisory activity. 
 
4. Obtain copies of complaints filed with the OCC (complaints reported to the Customer 
Assistance Group) and the CFPB (using the Consumer Complaint Database), and bank 
consumer complaint logs. Evaluate the information for significant issues and trends. 
 
Note: Complaints serve as a valuable early warning indicator for compliance, credit, and 
operational issues, including discriminatory, unfair, deceptive, abusive, and predatory 
practices. 
 
5. Determine whether there is any litigation, either filed or anticipated, associated with 
student lending activities and the expected cost or other implications. 
 
6. Develop an initial assessment of the quality and performance of the student lending 
portfolio and product segments using portfolio reports, risk management analyses, and 
the Uniform Bank Performance Reports. Consider 
 
• growth. 
• portfolio mix and changes. 
Comptroller’s Handbook 
45 
Student Lending 
Examination Procedures > Primary Examination Procedures 
• significance of the portfolio and each of the products in terms of total loans, total 
assets, and capital. 
• credit performance. 
• contribution to earnings and income composition (e.g., interest and fees). 
 
If the bank securitizes assets, analyze data on a managed basis. Coordinate findings and 
conclusions with the examiner(s) assigned to review securitizations throughout the 
examination. 
 
7. Discuss with management any changes made since the previous supervisory activity or 
planned for student lending products and operations, including 
 
• growth overall and in individual products. 
• portfolio product mix. 
• off-balance-sheet retail credit activities (e.g., securitization activities). 
• new products. 
• terms on existing products. 
• marketing or acquisition channels (e.g., direct mail, telemarketing, Internet, and third-
party originators). 
• expansion into new market and trade areas. 
• new or expanded third-party loan generation or servicing arrangements. 
• underwriting, risk selection criteria, and portfolio quality. 
• monitoring and risk management processes. 
• models used to underwrite or manage the portfolio, if any. 
• retail loan systems, including underwriting, servicing, and collection platforms. 
 
It is important to understand how management assesses the effects of changes on 
profitability and risk profile and how management incorporates the effects of changes 
into the planning and risk management processes. 
 
Discuss management’s perception of the competition and whether the bank can be 
successful in its market without changes. Determine the extent to which the changes 
made or proposed were in response to the competitive environment and the 
reasonableness of and analytical support for those changes. 
 
8. Evaluate student lending management and the planning process. Specifically, 
 
• determine whether student lending objectives are consistent with the bank’s strategic 
plan and whether the objectives are reasonable in light of the bank’s resources, 
expertise, capital support, product offerings, and competitive environment. 
• determine whether the student lending marketing plans and budgets are consistent 
with the retail credit objectives and the bank’s strategic plan. 
• evaluate the adequacy of the student lending planning process (internal limits, 
growth, financial, and product-related), including the adequacy and timeliness of 
revisions when warranted by portfolio performance and new developments. 
Comptroller’s Handbook 
46 
Student Lending 
Examination Procedures > Primary Examination Procedures 
• determine management’s risk appetite with respect to risk and return objectives (e.g., 
return on assets, return on equity, or return on investment) or credit performance 
hurdles (e.g., delinquency, credit loss, or risk score tolerances). 
• assess the qualifications, expertise, and staffing levels of management and staff in 
view of existing and planned student lending activities. 
 
9. Review and assess the adequacy of the bank’s policies, procedures, and practices. 
Specifically, 
 
• determine whether the board of directors approves the student loan policies at 
inception and includes those policies in its annual policy reviews thereafter. 
• identify significant changes in underwriting criteria and terms. Determine 
– the effect of those changes on the portfolio and its performance. 
– whether underwriting policies provide appropriate guidance on assessing both the 
borrower’s and the cosigner’s capacity to repay the loan. 
– that capacity to repay includes consideration of income, financial resources, and 
debt service obligations. 
• if the bank uses credit scoring models (e.g., bureau, pooled, or custom), 
– determine how the bank ensures that the model is appropriate for the target 
population and product offering. 
– assess the reasonableness of the process used to establish cutoffs and determine 
whether management changed the cutoffs between examinations and the 
implications for portfolio quality and performance. 
– determine whether the policy provides for model monitoring and validation. 
• determine how policies and policy changes are communicated to staff, and assess the 
adequacy of the process. 
• evaluate the bank’s process for establishing policy exception criteria and limits, and 
for monitoring and approving underwriting policy exceptions (e.g., underwriting 
standards, loan terms, score overrides, and income documentation). 
• determine the control processes used to track and monitor policy adherence (e.g., 
quality assurance, MIS reports, loan review, and audit), and assess the adequacy of 
those processes. 
• if the bank uses third parties for such services as loan origination or collection, 
determine 
– how policies are communicated to those entities. 
– the adequacy of the processes for monitoring and reporting policy adherence and 
performance. 
• determine whether the bank’s policies and procedures, including those for third 
parties, provide adequate guidance to avoid discriminatory, unfair, deceptive, 
predatory, and abusive lending practices76 (e.g., misleading disclosures). 
 
                                                           
76 For more information, refer to the “Fair Lending” booklet of the Comptroller’s Handbook; OCC Advisory 
Letters 2002-3, “Guidance on Unfair or Deceptive Acts or Practices,” and 2003-2, “Guidelines for National 
Banks to Guard Against Predatory and Abusive Lending Practices”; and OCC Bulletin 2014-42, “Interagency 
Guidance Regarding Unfair or Deceptive Credit Practices.” 
Comptroller’s Handbook 
47 
Student Lending 
Examination Procedures > Primary Examination Procedures 
10. Evaluate the condition and risk profile of the portfolio and individual products by 
reviewing historical trends and current levels of key performance indicators, such as loan 
balances, delinquencies, losses, recoveries, and profitability. Focus on dollar balance 
percentages but also consider percentages of numbers of accounts. Review performance 
indicators for 
 
• major products, sub-products, portfolio segments, acquisition channels, and acquired 
portfolios. 
• third-party originators. 
• internal performance indicator hurdles and metrics. Compare actual performance 
indicators with internally established objectives. 
• industry and peers, as available (e.g., industry organization, rating agency, and 
securitization research). Compare industry indicators with bank performance. 
 
In addition to coincident analysis,77 consider performing vintage analysis,78 especially if 
underwriting criteria, loan terms, or economic conditions have changed, and if the 
portfolio exhibits significant growth. If available and well maintained, the bank’s 
chronology log79 should prove useful in determining the causes of variances. 
 
11. Review new account application volumes, approval rates, and booking rates to assess 
portfolio growth. Review new account metrics to determine the composition and quality 
of accounts currently being booked. Compare the quality of recent account bookings with 
that of accounts booked in the past. Metrics evaluated should include credit score 
distributions (if used), price tiers, payment-to-income ratios, debt-to-income ratios, 
geographic distribution, override volume, and credit policy exceptions. 
 
12. Evaluate the expected performance of the portfolio and the individual products through 
analysis of management reports, portfolio segmentation, and discussions with 
management. Specifically, review 
 
• score distributions and trends for accounts over time, evaluating scores at application 
(e.g., application score and bureau score), refreshed bureau scores, and behavior 
scores. 
• delinquencies and losses by credit score range for each major scoring model and 
determine whether there has been any deterioration of the good-to-bad odds. 
• loan growth sources (e.g., branch, region, loan officer, and product channel, such as 
direct-to-consumer, school channel, telemarketing, direct mail, or Internet), and 
differences in performance by source. 
                                                           
77 Coincident analysis relies on end-of-period reported performance, e.g., delinquencies or losses in relation to 
total outstandings of the same date. 
 
78 Vintage analysis groups loans by origination (vintage) for analysis purposes. Performance trends are tracked 
for each vintage and compared with other vintages of similar age (time on book). 
 
79 The chronology log is a sequential record of internal and external events relevant to the credit function. 
Comptroller’s Handbook 
48 
Student Lending 
Examination Procedures > Primary Examination Procedures 
• levels and trends of policy documentation exceptions, and the comparison of 
performance of accounts with exceptions versus overall portfolio. 
• volumes and trends of first and early payment defaults. 
• management’s loss forecasts. 
 
13. Review collection department reports and activities to determine the implications for 
credit quality. 
 
Note: Several of the procedures already performed reflect collections activities (e.g., 
review of delinquencies and losses). 
 
• Review roll rate80 reports overall and by product; evaluate trends; and, if peer group 
performance is available, compare roll rates. Refer to appendix D of this booklet for 
more information on roll rates. 
• Review criteria, volume, performance, and trends for forbearance and other workout 
programs as well as for deferments, extensions, and restructures. 
• Determine the reasonableness of the bank’s collection strategies and the adequacy 
and timeliness of the processes for making revisions. 
• Review the loss forecasting process and determine whether it is reasonable and 
reliable. 
 
14. Assess the adequacy of MIS and reports used to provide management with the necessary 
information to monitor and manage all aspects of student lending. Determine whether 
 
• adequate processes exist to ensure data integrity and report accuracy, and balances 
and trends included in management’s student lending reports reconcile with the 
bank’s general ledger and with the call report. 
• various department reports are consistent, i.e., the reports show the same numbers for 
the same categories and time periods regardless of the unit generating the report. 
• descriptions of key management reports are maintained and updated. 
• reports are produced to track volume and performance by product, channel, and 
marketing initiative, and whether those reports support any test with implications for 
credit quality or performance (e.g., pricing, credit score cutoff, school, or program). 
This reporting process should be fully operational before the bank offers new 
products or initiates tests to accurately monitor performance from inception. 
• MIS and reports are available to clearly track volumes, performance, and trends for 
all types of forbearance and workout programs as well as activities including 
extensions, deferments, restructures, and modifications. 
• reports are clearly labeled and dated. 
 
15. Determine whether the amount of ALLL is appropriate and whether the method of 
calculating the allowance conforms with GAAP. Assess whether management routinely 
analyzes the portfolio to identify instances when the performance of a product or segment 
                                                           
80 Roll rates measure the movement of accounts and balances from one payment status to another (e.g., 
percentage of accounts or dollars that were current last month rolling to 30 days past due this month). 
Comptroller’s Handbook 
49 
Student Lending 
Examination Procedures > Primary Examination Procedures 
of a portfolio (e.g., workout programs) varies significantly from the performance of the 
overall portfolio. Any variation in performance should be adequately incorporated into 
the allowance analysis. Refer to the “Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses” booklet of 
the Comptroller’s Handbook for guidance and specifically consider 
 
• whether estimates and assumptions are documented and supported consistent with 
FFIEC guidance (OCC Bulletin 2001-37, “Policy Statement on Allowance for Loan 
and Lease Losses Methodologies and Documentation for Banks and Savings 
Institutions: ALLL Methodologies and Documentation”). 
• credit quality, including any changes to underwriting, account management, or 
collections that could affect future performance and credit losses. 
• historical credit performance and trends (e.g., delinquency roll rates and flow-to-loss) 
overall, by product, and by vintage within products. 
• level, trends, and performance of higher-risk populations (e.g., for-profit institutions). 
• level, trends, and performance of cure or workout programs, including deferment, 
forbearance, extension, modification, and restructure. 
• charge-off practices and consistency with OCC Bulletin 2000-20, “Uniform Retail 
Credit Classification and Account Management Policy: Policy Implementation,” and 
CNBE Policy Guidance 2010-2 (REV), “Policy Interpretation: OCC Bulletin 2000-
20—Application to Private Student Lending.” 
• whether management provides for accrued interest and fees deemed uncollectible in 
the allowance or in a separate reserve. 
• the effects of securitization activities, if applicable. 
• economic conditions and trends. 
 
16. Validate the preliminary risk assessment conclusions by conducting on-site transaction 
testing. The purpose of working these samples includes verifying adherence to bank 
policies; determining whether the bank maintains adequate documentation of analysis and 
decisions; verifying whether MIS reports accurately capture exception information; and 
determining whether practices are inconsistent with bank policy or are not adequately 
depicted in existing management reports. The sample selected should be sufficient in size 
to reach a supportable conclusion. 
 
Examiners conducting testing should remain alert for potential discriminatory, unfair, 
deceptive, abusive, and predatory lending. If weaknesses or concerns are found, consult 
the bank’s EIC or compliance examiner. 
 
For each product being reviewed, 
 
• sample recently approved loans to assess adherence to underwriting policy. If the 
bank uses credit scoring, select two samples: one sample from loans not automatically 
approved (e.g., judgmental decision involved even if credit scoring is used as a tool) 
and one sample from loans automatically approved. 
• sample recent “override” loans, i.e., exceptions to normal underwriting standards, to 
evaluate the adequacy and consistency of the judgmental decision process. 
Comptroller’s Handbook 
50 
Student Lending 
Examination Procedures > Primary Examination Procedures 
• sample loans that were 60 days or more delinquent two months ago and that are now 
current to determine whether the borrower cured the delinquency by making 
payments or whether the loan was extended or granted forbearance. If the latter, 
determine whether the action was consistent with existing bank policy and whether it 
complied with CNBE Policy Guidance 2010-2 (REV), “Policy Interpretation: OCC 
Bulletin 2000-20—Application to Private Student Lending.” 
• sample loans that were recently extended, deferred, renewed, or rewritten for 
compliance with bank policy and reasonableness. Compliance with bank policy 
should be judged against the bank’s normal underwriting guidelines with respect to 
debt-to-income, amortization period, debt or payment limitations, and pricing. 
• sample recently charged-off loans and review the borrower, payment, and collection 
history to determine whether the actions taken pre-charge-off were reasonable or if 
the practices simply had the effect of deferring losses. 
 
Based on the results of transactional testing and the severity of concerns identified, 
determine whether the sample should be expanded. (Note: Refer to appendix A, 
“Transaction Testing,” in this booklet for additional testing suggestions.) 
 
17. Complete the “Uniform Retail Credit Classification and Account Management Policy” 
checklist in appendix C of this booklet to determine the bank’s level of compliance with 
OCC Bulletin 2000-20, “Uniform Retail Credit Classification and Account Management 
Policy: Policy Implementation.” 
 
18. If the bank is involved in higher-risk student lending, regardless of whether formally 
designated as subprime, assess whether management realistically identifies the level of 
risk assumed and that the allowance and capital provide sufficient support for the activity. 
 
In addition, OCC Bulletin 1999-10, “Subprime Lending Activities,” and OCC Bulletin 
1999-15, “Subprime Lending: Risks and Rewards,” provide guidance on policies and 
procedures. If the bank has a targeted subprime program with volume exceeding 
25 percent of tier 1 capital, review adherence to the requirements of OCC Bulletin 2001-
6, “Expanded Guidance for Subprime Lending Programs.” 
 
19. If the bank relies on third-party relationships for significant functions, review compliance 
with OCC Bulletin 2013-29, “Third-Party Relationships: Risk Management Guidance.” 
 
20. Determine the effectiveness of the loan review process for student lending. Determine the 
scope and frequency of the reviews and whether loan review provides a risk assessment 
of the quality of risk management and quantity of risk for student lending. 
 
Note: Refer to the “Conclusions” section in this booklet to complete the assessment and 
the exam. 
 
21. Review copies of the materials provided to the board of directors and relevant senior 
management committees to determine if they are aware of the condition of the student 
Comptroller’s Handbook 
51 
Student Lending 
Examination Procedures > Primary Examination Procedures 
loan portfolio. These persons should be apprised of significant decisions that affect the 
quality and performance of the portfolio. 
 
22. Fully document findings, conclusions, and recommendations in a memorandum for 
review and approval by the loan portfolio management examiner or the EIC. Reach a 
conclusion on the quality of risk management and the quantity, aggregate level, and 
direction of risk, and include all necessary support. To accomplish these ends, complete 
the following procedures: 
 
• Determine whether further work needs to be completed in the student lending area to 
fully assess credit or other risks. If so, refer to the appropriate supplemental 
procedures. 
• Provide asset totals to the EIC. In addition to the delinquency-based classifications 
outlined in the FFIEC Uniform Retail Credit Classification and Account Management 
Policy, consider bankruptcies, workout programs, and any other segments that meet 
the classified definitions. 
• Provide student lending conclusions to the examiner responsible for assessing 
earnings and capital adequacy. 
• If the bank securitizes assets, provide conclusions and supporting information about 
credit quality to the examiner assigned to review securitizations. 
• If significant violations of laws or regulations are noted, prepare write-ups for 
inclusion in the ROE. 
• Prepare a recommended supervisory strategy for the student lending area. 
• Document findings in OCC systems as appropriate. 
 
Comptroller’s Handbook 
52 
Student Lending 
Examination Procedures > Supplemental Examination Procedures 
Supplemental Examination Procedures 
 
The supplemental examination procedures provide the steps necessary to expand the scope of 
the review. Examiners may need to follow these steps to supplement the primary procedures 
when the bank offers new or significantly changed products, when a particular concern 
exists, or when examining more complex operations. The supplemental examination 
procedures are organized by functional areas. 
 
Marketing and Account Acquisition 
 
Objective: To determine whether student lending marketing activities are consistent with the 
bank’s business plans, strategic plans, and risk appetite, and that appropriate controls and 
systems are in place before the bank rolls out new products or new-product marketing 
initiatives. 
 
1. Assess the structure and expertise of the marketing department, focusing on management, 
key personnel, and staffing adequacy. 
 
2. Review the bank’s marketing plan and assess it for reasonableness given the bank’s 
strategic plan and objectives, level of expertise, capacity (operational and financial 
resources), market area, and competition. 
 
• Determine whether the bank bases its plan on internally or externally prepared 
market, economic, or profitability studies. If external studies are used, obtain and 
review copies of those studies. 
• Review the process for developing and implementing marketing plans, with particular 
attention to whether the appropriate functional areas (e.g., risk management, finance, 
operations, information technology, legal, and compliance) are involved throughout 
the process. 
• Assess the appropriateness of the data and assumptions used to develop marketing 
plans, in part through the review of MIS reports that track actual performance against 
marketing plans. 
• Discuss with management the controls in place to monitor marketing plans and 
activities. 
 
Note: Before implementing any marketing initiative, including the rollout of a new 
product or change to an existing product, management should review all marketing 
materials, consumer disclosures, product features, and terms to identify and address 
potential discriminatory, unfair, deceptive, abusive, and predatory lending practices.81 
 
• Discuss with management any significant changes made or planned to the bank’s 
account acquisition, account management, and cross-selling strategies, including 
changes in channels and the use of third parties.

Comptroller’s Handbook 
53 
Student Lending 
Examination Procedures > Supplemental Examination Procedures 
3. Assess new product development. Specifically, 
 
• discuss with management the new product development process. 
• determine whether there are written guidelines for what constitutes a new product. 
• review new product proposals and plans approved since the last examination. 
• determine whether the appropriate functional areas (e.g., risk management, finance, 
operations, information technology, legal, and compliance) are involved throughout 
the development process to ensure that associated risks are properly identified and 
controlled. Determine whether the constituents remain involved during 
implementation. 
• evaluate systems planning to determine whether MIS and reporting needs are 
adequately researched and developed before new products are rolled out. Determine 
whether the systems and reports are adequate to supervise and administer new 
products. 
• evaluate the adequacy of the review and approval processes for new products. 
• determine whether management, including appropriate legal and compliance 
personnel, reviews marketing materials during product development and 
implementation to avoid deceptive or misleading advertising, terms, and disclosures. 
• determine whether the planning process adequately identifies and addresses the risks, 
operational needs, and systems support associated with different solicitation methods 
and channels, including direct applications, school applications, loan-by-phone, and 
the Internet. 
 
4. Evaluate the adequacy of the bank’s testing process for new products, marketing 
campaigns, and other significant initiatives. Review the process to assess whether testing 
 
• is a required step for any new products or significant marketing and account 
management initiatives. 
• is properly approved. Senior management should approve the testing plan and 
determine that the proposed test is consistent with the bank’s strategic plan and meets 
strategic objectives. 
• requires clear descriptions of test objectives and methods (e.g., assumptions, test size, 
selection criteria, and duration) as well as key performance measurements and targets. 
• includes a strong test and control discipline. The test should include a clean holdout 
group and test groups that are not subject to any significant account management or 
cross-selling initiatives for the duration of the test. Strict test group design enables 
management to draw more accurate performance conclusions. 
• is accorded an adequate period of time, sufficient to determine probable performance 
and to work through any operational or other issues. When the test involves a 
significant departure from existing bank products or practices, test duration should 
probably be longer. Tests generally should run at least six months and usually should 
run nine or 12 months. The time frame may vary depending on the product or practice 
being tested. 
• is supported by appropriate MIS and reporting before implementation. 
• requires a thorough and well-supported postmortem analysis in which results are 
presented to and approved by senior management and the board before full rollout. 
Comptroller’s Handbook 
54 
Student Lending 
Examination Procedures > Supplemental Examination Procedures 
5. Determine whether management assesses how underwriting standards for the new 
products may affect credit risk and the bank’s risk profile. 
 
6. Evaluate cross-selling strategies, including the criteria used to select accounts. 
 
7. If the bank maintains a data warehouse, determine how it is used for marketing purposes 
and if it is capable of aggregating customer loan relationships. 
 
8. Determine the adequacy and effectiveness of the bank’s controls regarding information 
sharing, for both affiliates and unrelated third parties. 
 
9. Prepare profiles for each of the products offered. Address 
 
• product description, including any unique characteristics and a general overview of 
terms (including pricing), target market (credit quality and geographic), and 
distribution channels. 
• changes in the product characteristics since the last examination. 
• volume and trends, discussing growth to date and planned. 
 
10. Select at least one new product introduced since the previous supervisory activity to 
assess the bank’s planning process. Specifically, review 
 
• the planning documents and the final approved proposal. 
• tests and analyses conducted, including performance compared to expectations. 
• MIS tracking reports. 
• available risk management, quality assurance, and audit reviews. 
• any subsequent product modifications and the basis and documented support for those 
changes. 
• management review and approval documentation. 
• information presented to the board of directors. 
 
11. Develop conclusions about whether marketing activities are consistent with the bank’s 
business plans, strategic plans, and risk appetite, and comply with applicable laws and 
regulations. Determine if appropriate controls and systems are in place before new 
products or marketing initiatives are rolled out. 
 
Underwriting 
 
Objective: To assess the quality of the bank’s new student loans and any changes from past 
underwriting; determine the adequacy of and adherence to student lending policies and 
procedures; determine compliance with applicable laws and regulations; and gain a thorough 
understanding of the processes employed in account origination. 
 
1. Ascertain and evaluate the types of student loans that the bank offers and evaluate the 
reasonableness of the following: 
Comptroller’s Handbook 
55 
Student Lending 
Examination Procedures > Supplemental Examination Procedures 
 
• Loan products offered and planned. 
• Underwriting standards and terms. 
• Degree of innovation (e.g., new terms, products, and markets). 
• Markets served and economic conditions. 
• Competitive environment. 
• Volume and proportion of loan portfolio (managed and on book), by product. 
• Level of participation in high-risk student lending. 
• Types of marketing and account acquisition channels. 
• Historical and planned growth. 
• Securitization activities. 
 
Note: When evaluating lending activities, examiners should remain alert for practices and 
product terms that could indicate potentially discriminatory, unfair, deceptive, abusive, or 
predatory practices. 
 
2. Review new account metrics to determine the composition and quality of accounts 
currently being booked and the adequacy of MIS used to track new loan volume. 
Compare the quality of recent bookings to the quality of accounts booked in the past. 
Metrics evaluated, by product, should include 
 
• application volume, and approval and booking rates. 
• distribution of credit scores, if used, by applications, approved and booked. 
• percentage of accounts with a cosigner. 
• composition of loans booked by school type (i.e., graduate school, four-year college, 
technical school, for-profit institution, etc.). 
• price tiers and fees. 
• geographic distribution. 
• override volume. 
• credit policy exceptions. 
 
3. Obtain an overview of the origination process and the steps involved. When describing 
the process in the work papers, document the following 
 
• Which aspects of the underwriting process are automated versus manual? 
• Use of credit scoring models (e.g., types of models, history of model use, monitoring, 
and validation). 
• Differences in the underwriting processes arising from the application channel (i.e., 
direct to consumer, telemarketing, Internet, and school), and the differences for 
unsolicited versus prescreened applications. 
 
4. Determine how management evaluates underwriter performance, including MIS for 
monitoring underwriter performance, and transaction testing completed by the 
underwriter manager for quality assurance. 
 
Comptroller’s Handbook 
56 
Student Lending 
Examination Procedures > Supplemental Examination Procedures 
5. If the bank uses credit scoring in the underwriting process, assess the mix of automated 
and judgmentally approved loans. Refer to the credit scoring steps in the “Risk 
Management and Control Functions” section of the “Supplemental Examination 
Procedures.” 
 
6. For banks that lend in multiple geographic areas or states, confirm that management 
performs periodic bureau preference analyses to determine optimal credit bureaus for 
different states or localities. 
 
7. Obtain a copy of the bank’s lending policies and procedures. Assess the adequacy and 
soundness of the policies and procedures, focusing on the main criteria used in the 
decision-making process and, if applicable, the verification processes used to confirm 
application and transaction information. Evaluate 
 
• permissible types of loans. 
• lending authority and limits, and the exception approval process. 
• limits on concentrations of credit (e.g., product and school type). 
• credit underwriting criteria, including measurements of the borrower and cosigner 
capacity to repay the loan (e.g., debt-to-income and payment-to-income ratios) and 
treatment of derogatory credit bureau items. 
• credit scorecard cutoffs and tolerances for overrides. 
• borrower credit grade definitions (e.g., A, B, and C). 
• repayment terms (e.g., duration, amortization schedule, and pricing). 
• exception and override processes, criteria, and tracking. 
 
8. Determine whether the policies and procedures provide adequate guidance to avoid 
discriminatory, unfair, deceptive, abusive, and predatory lending practices. If weaknesses 
or concerns are found, consult the bank’s EIC or compliance examiner. 
 
Note: For additional information, refer to the “Fair Lending” booklet of the 
Comptroller’s Handbook and OCC Advisory Letter 2002-3, “Guidance on Unfair or 
Deceptive Acts or Practices.” 
 
9. Assess the adequacy of the process for changing underwriting standards. Review all 
changes in standards since the last examination, and determine their effect on the quality 
of the loan portfolio. 
 
• Review analyses and documentation supporting recent changes to underwriting 
criteria and score cutoffs. 
• Discuss reasons for changes (if not readily apparent) with bank management and 
determine whether there has been a shift in the credit risk appetite. 
• Determine whether all affected functional areas provide input to underwriting 
changes. 
• Verify that management maintains a chronology of significant changes to 
underwriting standards. 
 
Comptroller’s Handbook 
57 
Student Lending 
Examination Procedures > Supplemental Examination Procedures 
10. Determine the adequacy of the bank’s verification procedures and verify that, at a 
minimum, residence, employment, income, and school certification are routinely 
confirmed for borrowers. 
 
11. Evaluate credit policy exception and scorecard override limits, tracking, and reporting. 
Determine whether 
 
• volumes conform to policy limits, and that those limits are reasonable. 
• management tracks the volumes and trends of policy exceptions (by type) and 
overrides separately and by reason code. 
• management tracks the performance (i.e., delinquencies and losses) of these accounts 
over time, by type, and compares the performance to that of the overall portfolio. 
• as warranted, management responds appropriately to the levels of overrides and 
exceptions, adjusting underwriting policies and exception limits or providing 
additional underwriter training accordingly. 
• management appropriately identifies the effects of the levels of exceptions and 
overrides and the performance of affected accounts on the quantity and direction of 
credit risk. 
 
12. Select and test appropriate loan samples to determine credit quality; to verify adherence 
to bank underwriting policies, including verification procedures; to assess the adequacy 
of analysis and decision documentation; to ensure compliance with laws and regulations; 
to determine that MIS reports accurately capture exception information; and to determine 
whether practices exist that are inconsistent with bank policy or that are not adequately 
depicted in existing management reports. If the underwriting is outsourced, obtain the 
bank’s on-site monitoring reports for third-party underwriting. The bank should be 
sampling and re-underwriting loans to ensure the third party is following the bank’s 
underwriting guidelines. For each significant product type, 
 
• sample recently approved loans to assess adherence to underwriting policy and 
applicable laws and regulations. If the bank uses credit scoring, select two samples: 
one sample from loans not automatically approved (e.g., judgmental decision 
involved even if credit scoring is used as a tool) and one sample from loans 
automatically approved. Ensure that your sample includes loans originated from each 
significant marketing channel and, if warranted, consider expanding the sample to 
more thoroughly test specific channels. 
• sample recently approved loans that represent exceptions to underwriting policy to 
determine whether credit decisions are consistent, whether the analysis and other 
support for them is adequate, and whether the exceptions are approved on a non-
prohibited basis. 
 
Use the bank’s credit files, account origination systems, and MIS reports to create a 
worksheet to summarize information for the sample. The worksheet should be 
tailored to fit the product and the bank’s underwriting criteria but generally includes 
the following information 
 
Comptroller’s Handbook 
58 
Student Lending 
Examination Procedures > Supplemental Examination Procedures 
– Account data: name, account number, origination date, employment information, 
time at residence, cosigner. 
– Underwriting terms: credit score (bureau, pooled, or custom), debt-to-income, 
payment-to-income, interest rate, loan term, payment amount. 
– Underwriting policy exceptions and score overrides (indicate whether bank or 
examiner identified). 
 
If prepared properly, the worksheet facilitates examiner analysis and provides a sound 
foundation for reaching conclusions about the adequacy of the bank’s policy and 
adherence to it. 
 
Note: Examiners should follow OCC internal policy in handling personally 
identifiable information. 
 
13. Based on the results of the testing and the severity of the concerns identified, determine 
whether the samples should be expanded. Refer to appendix A for additional sample 
suggestions. 
 
14. Develop conclusions on the quality of the bank’s new loans, any changes from past 
underwriting, the adequacy of and adherence to student lending policies and procedures, 
compliance with applicable laws and regulations, the processes employed in account 
origination, MIS for monitoring new loan volume, and implications for the risk profile of 
the loan portfolio. Clearly document all findings. 
 
Loan Servicing and Administration 
 
Objective: To assess the effectiveness of activities associated with student loan servicing and 
administration; determine whether student loan servicing and administrative activities are 
executed in compliance with applicable laws, regulations, board-approved strategy, and 
consistency with guidance; and to evaluate whether student loan servicing and administrative 
activities enhance performance of existing, nondelinquent accounts or portfolios. 
 
1. Determine whether the board of directors or its designated banking committee has 
adopted student lending policies that appropriately cover all facets of the servicing and 
administration operation. 
 
2. Determine whether the bank verifies the borrower’s in-school status. If so, assess the 
adequacy of the process, including the policies and procedures employed. 
 
3. Review policies and procedures in place to ensure the accuracy and integrity of 
information furnished to consumer reporting agencies. 
 
4. Evaluate the adequacy of the bank’s process for approving and communicating approval 
of private student loans. 
 
5. Determine whether bank systems are capable of aggregating the entire loan relationship 
Comptroller’s Handbook 
59 
Student Lending 
Examination Procedures > Supplemental Examination Procedures 
by customer (multiple loan accounts by product and in total) for the purpose of customer-
level account management. If so, determine the extent to which the bank uses that 
capability. 
 
6. Determine whether the bank provides both the borrower and cosigners with necessary 
information and disclosures during the application, approval, and closing process. 
 
7. Assess the adequacy of the bank’s processes when the borrower is transitioning to 
repayment. 
 
8. Determine whether the bank provides the borrower and cosigners with information 
associated with different repayment options before the loan becomes due or before 
repayment begins. If so, evaluate the adequacy of the process, including the timing of the 
notification, information provided (i.e., online), and other tools and options provided to 
help the borrower manage repayment of the loan. 
 
9. Assess the bank’s policies and procedures, internal controls, and training regarding 
identifying and following all repayment options. 
 
10. Determine whether the bank has retained appropriate documentation of all benefits 
offered to the borrower and whether the bank has sufficient controls to ensure that rules 
on earned benefits are followed. 
 
11. Determine whether the bank provides borrowers with periodic statements of the account. 
If so, examiners should review policies, procedures, and systems to assess the adequacy 
of statements that are provided to borrowers. 
 
12. Determine whether the bank will renew, modify, or rewrite existing loans to 
nondelinquent customers. If so, evaluate the adequacy of the process, including the 
policies and procedures employed and the volume, trends, and subsequent performance 
of those loans. 
 
Collections 
 
Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of the student lending collection function, including the 
collection strategies and programs employed, to better assess the quality of the portfolio and 
the quantity and direction of credit risk. 
 
1. Assess the structure, management, and staffing of the collections department. If not 
previously performed, 
 
• review the organization chart for the department and evaluate the quality and depth of 
the staff based on the size and complexity of the operation. 
• discuss with senior management staffing plans for each major collection activity, such 
as early stage, late stage, fraud, and agency-management third-party collection, 
Comptroller’s Handbook 
60 
Student Lending 
Examination Procedures > Supplemental Examination Procedures 
including how plans fit with department and bank objectives (e.g., growth and credit 
performance projections). 
• review the experience of senior managers and supervisors. 
• assess the adequacy of the bank’s training program for collectors through discussions 
with management. 
• assess the appropriateness and administration of the bank’s incentive pay program for 
collectors. Pay particular attention to possible negative ramifications of the plan, such 
as the potential to encourage protracted repayment plans, aggressive curing of 
accounts, or individual rather than team efforts. Determine whether the plan limits the 
total incentive pay that a collector can receive. 
• determine whether the board or senior management reviewed and approved the 
incentive pay program before implementation. 
 
2. Assess the adequacy of the bank’s written collection policies and procedures. Determine 
whether they cover all significant collection activities and are consistent with OCC 
Bulletin 2000-20, “Uniform Retail Credit Classification and Account Management 
Policy: Policy Implementation,” and CNBE Policy Guidance 2010-2 (REV), “Policy 
Interpretation: OCC Bulletin 2000-20—Application to Private Student Lending.” Refer to 
the checklist in appendix C of this booklet. 
 
• Verify that the bank’s policies prohibit the rebooking of accounts that are charged off 
for anything other than bank error. 
• Determine whether the bank is considered a debt collector as defined by the FDCPA. 
If so, ensure appropriate review at the next compliance examination. 
• Identify where management has implemented automated decisions (i.e., charge-off, 
extensions, forbearance) to be consistent with the OCC policy guidelines. 
 
3. Evaluate the adequacy of the bank’s classification, nonaccrual, and charge-off practices 
and whether the practices comply with the bank’s written policies and procedures. 
 
• Discuss practices with both management and line personnel. Identify any 
inconsistencies with policies and procedures versus practices. Ensure examiners 
assisting with the collection review and conducting testing are aware of these 
inconsistencies. 
• Identify where management has implemented automated processes versus manual 
processes to comply with policies. Review the system settings to verify that the 
parameters correspond to those described in the bank’s policies and are consistent 
with FFIEC policies. If not, discuss the differences with management and request 
appropriate corrective action. 
• Request management’s summary of classified student loans. Determine if the 
classification practices are consistent with OCC Bulletin 2000-20. Private student 
loans should be classified substandard at 90 days past due and loss at 120 days past 
due. 
• Request management’s summary of nonaccrual student loans. If the bank does not 
place student loans on nonaccrual status, determine that the bank employs appropriate 
Comptroller’s Handbook 
61 
Student Lending 
Examination Procedures > Supplemental Examination Procedures 
methods to ensure income is accurately measured (e.g., loss allowances for 
uncollectible fees and finance charges). 
• Determine how accounts scheduled for charge-off are loaded into a charge-off queue 
or other system for loss. Specifically, determine whether losses are automatically or 
manually processed; what circumstances, if any, will delay a charge-off; and when 
the bank recognizes losses (i.e., daily, weekly, or monthly). 
• Request a report detailing student loans more than 120 days past due that have not 
been charged off. Review the report with management and determine why those 
balances remain on the bank’s books and whether there are system or policy issues 
that need to be corrected. 
 
4. Evaluate the adequacy of the bank’s policies and practices for payment posting and 
assessing late fees. 
 
• Review the payment posting procedures and practices and determine if payments are 
promptly posted. 
• Determine the conditions under which late fees are imposed82 and, if applicable, at 
what point the fees are suspended. 
• Determine the bank’s policy for collecting late fees (e.g., as part of the next regularly 
scheduled payment) and how unpaid late fees are accounted for, tracked, and 
collected. 
• Determine whether the bank’s process for evaluating the ramifications of changes in 
late fee policies, including dollar amounts, is adequate before broad 
implementation.83 
• Assess whether the available MIS and reports provide the information necessary to 
evaluate the effect of late fees. Specifically, assess whether the information is 
sufficient to allow management to determine whether the fees have the desired effect 
on performance (i.e., improve on-time payments), whether late fees result in negative 
amortization, and the extent to which late fees assessed are actually collected. 
• Ensure that the bank has established adequate loss allowance for accrued but 
uncollectible interest and fees, including late fees, in either the allowance or a 
separate reserve. 
 
5. Assess the appropriateness of management’s collection strategies. 
 
• Through discussions with management, determine how management develops 
collection strategies, who is responsible, and how the success of the strategies is 
measured. 
• Determine what triggers strategy changes and who has authority to direct revisions. 
• Establish whether the bank uses scoring or any other predictive techniques to assist in 
the collection of accounts. If so, determine 
                                                           
82 For example, UDAP concerns could arise from a bank practice of assessing a late fee when the delinquency is 
only attributable to a late fee assessed on an earlier installment, and the payment is otherwise a full payment for 
the applicable period and is paid on its due date or within an applicable grace period. 
 
83 12 CFR 7.4002(b) sets forth the criteria for national bank fees and charges. 
Comptroller’s Handbook 
62 
Student Lending 
Examination Procedures > Supplemental Examination Procedures 
– the scores or techniques used, how they are used, and whether they are internally 
or externally developed. 
– when the scores or techniques were last validated and by whom, and the results of 
the validation. 
 
6. If applicable, assess the adequacy of the bank’s use of collection strategies. 
 
• Identify the person or group responsible for strategy development. 
• Determine that the development process begins with a clear identification of strategy 
objectives and relies on reasonable assumptions and complete and accurate MIS. 
• Determine that the bank’s controls provide for proper testing of strategies before 
making decisions to expand penetration. 
• Assess the monitoring process and determine whether the bank accumulates and 
analyzes appropriate data to measure strategy success. 
• Determine that the bank maintains adequate documentation of the various strategies. 
 
7. Determine whether the bank uses cure programs such as deferment, extension, 
forbearance, restructures and modifications, or settlement and forgiveness. If so, 
 
• assess the adequacy of the policies and procedures used to administer the programs 
and consistency with OCC Bulletin 2000-20, “Uniform Retail Credit Classification 
and Account Management Policy: Policy Implementation,” and CNBE Policy 
Guidance 2010-2 (REV), “Policy Interpretation: OCC Bulletin 2000-20—Application 
to Private Student Lending.” 
• review and evaluate any test and analysis summaries completed before 
implementation of new cure programs. 
• determine whether the bank’s programs appropriately address proper income 
recognition for restructured loans. 
• evaluate the MIS and reporting used to monitor and analyze the performance of each 
program. Compare performance with forecasts, bank objectives, and risk appetite. In 
addition to reports listed in the bank’s collections procedures, ensure that 
management generates and reviews reports detailing 
– volume (balance and unit) trends for cure program accounts, by product, program, 
and vintage, and in total. 
– loss performance, by product, program, and vintage, and in total. 
– performance of the accounts 30, 90, 180, 270, 360, etc., days following the cure. 
– performance of accounts cured more than once, broken down by the number of 
times cured and tracked over time. 
– policy exceptions and the performance of those exceptions. 
• compare the performance of accounts in cure programs with the performance of those 
in the general student loan population using appropriate performance measures. 
• assess the current and potential impact of such programs on the bank’s reported 
performance (asset quality) and profitability, including allowance and capital 
implications. 
 
8. Review and determine the effectiveness of the bank’s skip tracing practices and 
Comptroller’s Handbook 
63 
Student Lending 
Examination Procedures > Supplemental Examination Procedures 
procedures to track delinquent customers. 
 
• Ascertain what portion of the portfolio lacks current and correct telephone numbers 
and mailing addresses. 
• Evaluate the adequacy of the bank’s process for obtaining missing contact 
information. 
• Determine whether the bank has a process to exclude accounts without pertinent 
contact information from promotional initiatives and favorable account management 
treatment. 
• If applicable, determine whether the bank appropriately monitors outside agencies 
used to skip-trace accounts. 
• Determine whether skip accounts are flagged for accelerated charge-off if attempts to 
locate the borrower are unsuccessful. 
 
9. Assess whether the bank’s automated systems for collecting delinquent accounts are 
adequate and discuss these systems with management. 
 
• Determine which technologies and processes the bank uses to collect accounts (e.g., 
automated dialers, collection letters, statement messaging, and e-mail), how each is 
used, and the key reports generated to monitor performance. Determine whether the 
reports provide sufficient data to allow management to make appropriate decisions. 
• If auto-dialing is used, determine how the system routes “no contact” accounts or 
accounts that collectors remove from the dialer because of a promise to pay or a 
payment arrangement. 
• Determine whether the systems generate a sufficient audit trail. 
• Determine whether managers, supervisors, and quality control staff have the ability to 
listen to collector phone calls online. 
• Evaluate the adequacy of the bank’s contingency plans and determine whether the 
plans are tested regularly. 
 
10. Assess the quality, accuracy, and completeness of MIS reports and other analyses used to 
manage the collections process. 
 
• Evaluate the quality of MIS collection reports regularly provided to executive 
management and determine whether the reports provide adequate information, 
including comparisons with collection objectives and tolerances, for timely decision-
making. 
• Determine the appropriateness and accuracy of key collection reports. Specifically 
review 
– vintage and coincident delinquency and loss reports. 
– roll rate reports and migration-to-loss reports. 
– cure program reports, in total, by program and by collector.  
– pipeline reports that track the volume (number and dollar) of accounts entering 
cure programs, accounts awaiting extension, forbearance, and the actual 
performance of accounts in the various programs. 
– collector and strategy reports. 
Comptroller’s Handbook 
64 
Student Lending 
Examination Procedures > Supplemental Examination Procedures 
– productivity reports, including information such as call frequency, right-party 
contact, promises made and kept, dollars collected, and staffing summaries. 
 
Note: If not removed, not sufficient funds checks can affect several of the metrics 
above. Management should have a method to identify, if not correct, the effects of not 
sufficient funds checks on the metrics. 
 
• Determine whether customer service or a department other than collections can 
initiate collection activities, such as cure programs. If so, determine whether 
appropriate MIS are in place to monitor volumes and credit performance of accounts 
in collection activities initiated outside collections. 
 
11. Determine what system(s) the bank uses to recover charged-off accounts and deficiency 
balances and whether they interface with the bank’s collection management system(s). If 
not, determine how the recovery unit gathers and uses information about previous 
collection activities. 
 
12. Determine whether the bank uses outside agencies (including attorneys and attorney 
networks) to collect delinquent accounts or to recover losses. If so, 
 
• assess the bank’s due diligence process for selecting third-party collectors. 
• determine whether the bank’s legal counsel and compliance officer have reviewed the 
contracts with and practices of third-party collectors. 
• evaluate any forward-flow contracts with collection agencies, including performance 
tolerances and termination requirements (important for remediation or severing the 
contract in the event of poor performance). Forward-flow contracts provide agencies 
with a set number of accounts at a determined frequency and help the bank forecast 
placements. 
• determine the frequency and method of rotating accounts, including reasons 
supporting the method, between collection and recovery agencies and in-house 
collections, i.e., distinctions among primary, secondary, and tertiary. 
• review productivity and cost reports for each third party, and discuss with 
management how the bank monitors the success of collectors and allocates workload 
accordingly. 
• evaluate the systems and controls used to supervise out-placed accounts, including 
active reconcilements of amounts collected and fees disbursed to each third party. 
• review MIS used to monitor the performance of outside agencies. 
• evaluate the adequacy and frequency of the bank’s audits (on-site and remote, if 
applicable) of third-party collectors. 
• determine whether any sales of fully charged-off loans are consistent with OCC 
Bulletin 2014-37, “Consumer Debt Sales: Risk Management Guidance.” 
 
13. Assess the bank’s recovery performance using historical results and industry averages, by 
product, as guidelines. 
 
Comptroller’s Handbook 
65 
Student Lending 
Examination Procedures > Supplemental Examination Procedures 
• Determine whether the bank periodically sells charged-off accounts. If so, determine 
the reasonableness of forecasts for recoveries. 
• Evaluate the bank’s recoveries in light of previous period losses. 
• Evaluate the accuracy of the recovery figures. If the bank charges accrued but 
uncollected interest and fees against income rather than the allowance, verify that 
recoveries are reported accordingly (i.e., include principal only). 
• Assess the costs associated with the dollars recovered and explore trends. 
 
14. Assess the appropriateness of the bank’s fraud policies and procedures. 
 
• Review the bank’s definition of fraud losses and ensure that it is reasonable and 
appropriately distinguishes fraud from credit losses. 
• Ascertain for consistency with the charge-off requirements of OCC Bulletin 2000-20, 
“Uniform Retail Credit Classification and Account Management Policy: Policy 
Implementation” (90 days from discovery). 
• Confirm that fraud losses are recognized as operating expenses rather than charges to 
ALLL. 
 
15. Review the adequacy of MIS reports pertaining to fraud. 
 
• Determine whether the information is sufficient to monitor fraud and the 
effectiveness of fraud controls, including the appropriate filing of suspicious activity 
reports. 
• Assess the levels and trends of fraud losses, by product, compared with industry 
averages and discuss any atypical findings with management. 
 
16. Assess the adequacy of internal and external audit, quality assurance, loan review, and 
risk management in the collections area, including scope, frequency, timing, report 
content, and independence. 
 
• Review relevant audit, quality assurance, loan review, and risk management reports. 
• Determine the adequacy and timeliness of management’s responses to the issues 
identified and any findings or issues requiring follow-up. If warranted based on the 
significance of the issues or concerns about the adequacy of the response or action 
taken, test corrective action. 
 
17. Conduct transaction testing to verify your initial conclusions on the bank’s collection 
programs and activities. In addition to determining adherence to approved policies and 
procedures, determine whether the programs and activities result in an enduring positive 
change in credit risk or provide temporary relief. Verify that MIS reports accurately 
capture the activities and the subsequent performance of the accounts (refer to appendix 
A for additional guidance). 
 
• Sample accounts that were at least 60 days delinquent in the month preceding the 
examination and are now current to determine whether the customer cured the 
delinquency or whether the account was cured artificially (e.g., extended grace or 
Comptroller’s Handbook 
66 
Student Lending 
Examination Procedures > Supplemental Examination Procedures 
forbearance). Determine whether the action was consistent with existing bank policy 
and OCC Bulletin 2000-20, “Uniform Retail Credit Classification and Account 
Management Policy: Policy Implementation,” and CNBE Policy Guidance 2010-2, 
“Policy Interpretation: OCC Bulletin 2000-20–Application to Private Student 
Lending.” 
• Sample accounts from each of the primary collection areas (e.g., early-stage, late-
stage, skip, or bankruptcy) to determine adherence to policy. The sample helps an 
examiner understand the collection process and strategies employed. (Note: This 
sample is often best completed or supplemented by sitting with collectors as they 
work accounts.) 
• Sample loans from each of the following areas to assess compliance with the bank 
policies for the programs and reasonableness of decisions: recent deferment, extended 
grace, extension, forbearance, restructures, and modification. Decisions should be 
compared with the bank’s normal underwriting guidelines on amortization period, 
debt or repayment limitations, and pricing. 
• Sample charged-off accounts and review all activities that occurred before charge-off 
to determine whether the bank employs practices that result in loss deferral. 
• Sample identified fraud accounts and review all activities to determine adherence to 
policy and timeliness of charge-off practices. 
 
18. Develop conclusions regarding the effectiveness of the collection function, including the 
collection strategies and programs employed, and the implications for the quality of the 
portfolio and the quantity and direction of credit risk. 
 
Risk Management and Control Functions 
 
Objective: To evaluate the adequacy of the bank’s student lending processes for identifying, 
measuring, monitoring, and controlling risk by reviewing the effectiveness of risk 
management and other control functions. 
 
1. Assess the structure,84 management, and staffing of each of the control functions, 
including risk management, loan review, internal and external audit, quality assurance, 
and compliance review. 
 
Note: Compliance is a risk for student lending. While consumer compliance examiners 
generally assess the quality of the compliance review function, safety and soundness 
examiners should understand compliance-related roles, responsibilities, and coverage, as 
well as how compliance controls fit into the overall control plan. 
 
2. Ascertain the roles, responsibilities, and reporting lines of the various control functions 
through discussions with senior management. 
 
                                                           
84 Depending on the bank, risk management functions may be managed from different areas in the bank (i.e., 
some from the line of business and others from the corporate offices). 
Comptroller’s Handbook 
67 
Student Lending 
Examination Procedures > Supplemental Examination Procedures 
• Review the organization chart for each function and evaluate the quality and depth of 
staff (including number of positions) based on the assigned role and the size and 
complexity of the operation. 
– Review the experience levels of senior managers and staff. 
– Determine whether employees are capable of evaluating the line of business 
activities. 
– Review management and staff turnover levels. 
• Discuss the structure and staffing plans, including known or anticipated gaps or 
vacancies, with senior management. 
• Review compensation plans to determine that performance measurements are 
appropriately targeted to risk identification and control objectives. 
• Determine whether organizational reporting lines create the necessary level of 
independence. 
 
Note: If the management and staff of a control function lack the knowledge or capability 
to adequately review all or parts of student lending operations, management may need to 
consult or hire appropriate outside expertise. 
 
3. Discuss with senior managers how they assess whether significant risks are appropriately 
monitored by at least one control function and how they assess the effectiveness of each 
function. 
 
4. Determine whether the risk management function appropriately monitors, analyzes, and 
controls the bank’s credit risk. 
 
• Determine risk management’s recurring responsibilities and major projects, including 
status of projects, and assess the adequacy of those activities in light of the bank’s 
student lending risk profile, the products offered, and the complexity of the operation. 
• Determine whether credit risk decisions involve all key functional areas, including 
risk management, marketing, finance, operations, compliance, legal, and information 
technology, either formally or informally. 
• Determine whether risk management is involved in tactical student lending decisions, 
such as program approvals, program renewals, new products, marketing campaigns, 
and annual financial planning. 
• Obtain descriptions of key management reports to determine the types and purposes 
of reports produced, report distribution, and frequency of preparation. 
• Obtain a sample of recent ad hoc or special studies or board reports produced by risk 
management to determine the types of analyses performed, the reasonableness of the 
scopes and methodologies used, and the accuracy of the conclusions drawn, including 
the adequacy of the support provided. 
• Determine what technologies and risk tools are deployed and risk management’s role 
in the management of those tools, including data warehouse, portfolio management 
software, credit scoring, and risk models. 
• Determine whether market, competitive, legislative, and other external factors are 
considered in the risk management process. 
 
Comptroller’s Handbook 
68 
Student Lending 
Examination Procedures > Supplemental Examination Procedures 
5. Determine whether management considers consumer complaints and complaint 
resolution in the risk management process. Obtain copies of complaints filed with the 
OCC (complaints reported to the Customer Assistance Group) and the CFPB (using the 
Consumer Complaint Database), and bank consumer complaint logs and evaluate the 
information for significant issues and trends. Complaints often serve as a valuable early 
warning indicator for compliance, credit, and operational issues, including 
discriminatory, unfair, deceptive, abusive, and predatory practices. 
 
6. Determine whether changes to practices and products, including new products and 
practices, are fully tested, analyzed, and supported before broad implementation. 
 
7. Test the effectiveness of the bank’s risk management process for existing and new 
products, marketing and collection initiatives, and changes to risk appetite (e.g., initiating 
or changing credit criteria or adopting new scoring systems and technologies). Select at 
least one significant new product or collections initiative (e.g., forbearance or 
modification), and track it through all facets of the management process. 
 
• Planning: If tracking a new loan product, for example, determine how the bank 
developed new underwriting standards (e.g., how did it analyze the applicability of 
the underwriting criteria and marketing strategies then in use and what was the basis 
of any projections?), and how did it derive new criteria or strategies (e.g., what were 
the key drivers for credit and revenue?). 
• Execution: Evaluate the adequacy of the process employed to ensure that new criteria 
and changes were implemented as intended. This component is generally performed 
by some combination of information technology staff, product management, quality 
control, audit, and loan operations. 
• Measurement: Ascertain how adherence to standards is measured and how 
management measures affect using back-end monitoring and analysis. Determine the 
key measurements management uses to analyze the effectiveness of its decisions 
(e.g., responder analyses, first or early payment default, vintage reporting for 
delinquencies and losses, risk-adjusted margin, and profit and loss) and the adequacy 
of back-testing analyses (comparison to targets, identification and analysis of 
anomalies). 
• Adjustment: Determine how feedback results (lessons learned, opportunities 
identified) are incorporated into the process as course corrections or adjustments. 
Assess the process for making adjustments as problems or unexpected performance 
results are identified, and whether the process is both timely and appropriate. 
 
8. Determine whether the bank has the data warehousing capabilities (i.e., the capacity to 
store and retrieve pertinent data) to support necessary monitoring, analytical, and 
forecasting activities. 
 
9. Evaluate executive management’s monthly and quarterly report packages. Specifically, 
 
• determine whether the reports accurately and completely describe the state of the 
bank’s student lending business. 
Comptroller’s Handbook 
69 
Student Lending 
Examination Procedures > Supplemental Examination Procedures 
• evaluate whether reports adequately measure credit risk (e.g., score distributions and 
vintage reports), identify trends, describe significant variances, and present issues. 
(Note: Reports should allow management to assess whether student lending 
operations remain consistent with strategic objectives and within established risk, 
return, and credit performance tolerances.) 
• determine whether reports clearly indicate analysis of performance results and trends 
rather than merely depict data. 
 
10. Obtain feedback from other examiners assigned to the student lending examination 
regarding the adequacy of reports available. 
 
Credit Scoring Models 
 
Note: Refer to OCC Bulletins 1997-24, “Credit Scoring Models: Examiner Guidance,” and 
2011-12, “Supervisory Guidance on Model Risk Management,” for additional background 
and guidance in this area. 
 
11. Assess the adequacy of the student loan scorecard management process, and determine 
the effectiveness of the department or personnel responsible for scorecard and model 
development or procurement, implementation (including monitoring), and validation. 
 
• Obtain a model inventory to determine the models in use. The inventory should 
include 
– name of the model. 
– model description. 
– type (custom, generic, behavioral). 
– date developed. 
– source (name of the third-party or in-house modeler). 
– purpose (e.g., pricing, profitability, or collectability). 
– date last validated and next scheduled validation date. 
– model rating from either the last validation or ongoing monitoring. 
– models under development, if any. 
– management contact for each model. 
• Determine whether scorecards are used for purposes consistent with the development 
process and populations. If not (e.g., applied to a different product or new geographic 
area), assess the ramifications and acceptability. 
• Review the most recent independent validation reports for key risk models and 
discuss the conclusions with risk management. 
• Discuss how management uses the models to target prospects, underwrite 
applications, and manage the portfolio. 
• Determine how management measures the ongoing performance and robustness of 
models (e.g., good and bad separation, bad rate analysis, and maximum delinquency 
[“ever bad”] distribution reports). 
• Review scorecard tracking reports to determine how well the models are performing. 
Select tracking reports for key models and determine whether model performance is 
stable or deteriorating, and how management compensates for deteriorating efficacy. 
Comptroller’s Handbook 
70 
Student Lending 
Examination Procedures > Supplemental Examination Procedures 
• Determine how cutoffs are established, reviewed, and adjusted. Review the most 
recent cutoff analysis for key risk models. 
• Determine the bank’s score override policy, assess the adequacy of associated 
tracking, and review override volume and performance. Determine whether 
management segments low-side overrides by reason and tracks delinquencies or 
defaults by reason and override score bands, and assess the performance and trends. 
• Review chronology logs to determine changes in the credit criteria or risk profile and 
to explain shifts in the portfolio, including volume and performance. 
 
12. Select at least one key student loan credit risk scoring model and fully assess the 
adequacy of the model management process. 
 
• Review the original model documentation or scorecard manual, and assess 
management’s adherence to the modeler’s recommended scorecard maintenance 
routine. 
• Compare the population characteristics and the developmental sample performance 
by log odds ratio with the bank’s current experience. 
• Review model performance reports and assess the adequacy of management’s 
response to the issues or trends identified. Reports reviewed may include applicant 
distribution, population stability, characteristic analysis (if indicated by a population 
shift), override tracking, and vintage delinquency and loss distribution reports. 
 
Loan Review 
 
13. Assess the adequacy of the loan review process for student lending. Determine whether 
 
• the loan review’s scope includes providing a risk assessment of the quality of risk 
management and quantity of risk for student lending in aggregate and by student loan 
program. 
• the scope includes appropriate testing for adherence to key credit policies and 
procedures. 
• the scope includes appropriate reviews to assess compliance with applicable laws, 
regulations, and consistency with regulatory guidance. 
• the scope includes a review of the accuracy and adequacy of MIS reporting. 
• the frequency of reviews is acceptable based on the significance of the risks involved. 
• staffing levels and experience are commensurate with the complexity and risk in the 
student lending area. 
• loan review is independent from the production process. 
• loan review possesses sufficient authority and influence to correct deficiencies or 
curb dangerous practices. 
 
14. Evaluate recent loan review reports for student lending. Determine whether 
 
• reports are issued in a timely manner following completion of the on-site work. 
• reports provide meaningful conclusions and accurately identify concerns. 
Comptroller’s Handbook 
71 
Student Lending 
Examination Procedures > Supplemental Examination Procedures 
• significant issues require management’s written response. 
• management initiates timely and appropriate corrective action. 
• issues identified and the status of corrective actions are tracked and reported to senior 
management. 
 
Note: Weaknesses identified by examiners, but not identified by the loan review, may be 
evidence of deficiencies in loan review processes or staffing. 
 
Quality Control 
 
15. Assess the adequacy of the quality control process for student lending. Determine 
whether 
 
• the process assesses ongoing compliance with key credit and operational policies and 
procedures, and applicable laws and regulations for all primary areas, including 
– loan origination. 
– account management. 
– customer service. 
– collections. 
 
Note: Quality control processes should be established for all student lending activities 
and any third-party loan servicing and origination arrangements. 
 
• quality control tests the integrity and accuracy of MIS data for areas listed above. 
• the frequency of reviews is properly geared to the significance of the risk. 
• the testing and sample sizes are appropriate. 
• the quality control function possesses sufficient authority and influence to correct 
deficiencies or curb dangerous practices. 
 
16. Review a sample of quality assurance ongoing testing worksheets and periodic summary 
reports (e.g., monthly summaries of testing conclusions). Determine whether 
 
• the reporting process allows for timely feedback to management. 
• worksheets and summary reports accurately identify concerns. 
• significant issues require management’s written response. 
• management initiates timely and appropriate corrective action. 
• issues identified and the status of corrective actions are tracked and reported to senior 
management. 
 
Note: Weaknesses identified by examiners, but not identified by the quality control 
function, may be evidence of deficiencies in quality control processes or staffing. 
 
17. If the quality assurance function is not independent from the loan production process, 
determine whether internal audit or loan review tests quality assurance to ensure that 
management can rely on those findings. 
 
Comptroller’s Handbook 
72 
Student Lending 
Examination Procedures > Supplemental Examination Procedures 
18. If reviews and testing by the quality control area do not include significant risk areas, 
communicate findings to the EIC to determine whether it is appropriate to complete 
transactional testing in areas not covered by quality control. 
 
Internal Audit 
 
19. Assess the adequacy of internal audit for student lending. Determine whether 
 
• the scope includes appropriate testing for adherence to key credit and operational 
policies and procedures. 
• the frequency of reviews is properly geared to the significance of the risks. 
• internal audit is independent. 
• internal audit possesses sufficient authority and influence to correct deficiencies or 
curb dangerous practices. 
 
Note: Refer to the “Internal and External Audits” booklet of the Comptroller’s Handbook 
for additional information. 
 
20. Review recent internal audit reports for student lending. Determine whether 
 
• reports are issued in a timely manner following completion of the on-site work. 
• reports accurately identify concerns. 
• significant issues require management’s written response. 
• management initiates timely and appropriate corrective action. 
• issues identified and the status of corrective actions are tracked and reported to senior 
management. 
 
Note: Weaknesses identified by examiners, but not identified by internal audit, may be 
evidence of deficiencies in internal audit processes or staffing. 
 
Other Controls 
 
21. Confirm that there is an adequate student lending process in place to reconcile major 
balance sheet categories and general ledger entries on a daily basis. 
 
22. Identify and determine the adequacy of the bank’s student lending process for regularly 
evaluating data integrity and MIS accuracy. 
 
• Review the scope and frequency of internal audit or other reviews of MIS accuracy. 
• Review the findings of the most recent reviews. 
 
23. Develop conclusions on the adequacy of the bank’s processes for identifying, measuring, 
monitoring, and controlling risk by reviewing the effectiveness of risk management and 
other control functions. Clearly document all findings.

Examination Procedures > Supplemental Examination Procedures 
Profitability 
 
Objective: To assess the quantity, quality, and sustainability of student lending earnings. 
 
Note: For banks that securitize, examiners should review income statements for managed 
assets. 
 
1. Obtain and review copies of the income statement for the student loan portfolio and for 
each significant form of student loan offered. Assess whether the reports include all 
pertinent income and expense items including overhead and funding costs. 
 
2. Ascertain the contribution of the student loan portfolio to earnings and the expected 
contribution in the future. 
 
• Review executive management monthly or quarterly performance reports and 
portfolio quality MIS packages. 
• Review historical trends, including changes in the product contributions. 
• Review financial projections and budget and plan variances. 
• Review significant income and expense components and measures. Items reviewed 
should include noninterest income (fees and other add-ons), marketing expenses, 
charge-offs, net interest margin, and risk-adjusted yield. 
• Evaluate the methodologies, assumptions, and documentary support for the bank’s 
planning and forecasting processes. Determine whether material changes are expected 
in any of the key income and expense components and measures. 
• Determine the bank’s return on assets85 and return on equity86 hurdles, and the actual 
returns as of the examination date. Asset-based measures are typically more 
meaningful for comparison because banks allocate capital differently. 
 
3. Verify that the bank appropriately recognizes uncollectible accrued interest and fees 
through ALLL, through a separate interest and fee reserve, or through cash income 
recognition. 
 
4. Review the bank’s stress test and discuss potential earnings volatility through an 
economic cycle with management to assess sustainability. If the bank does not perform 
stress testing, discuss if and how management prices loans to withstand economic 
downturns. 
 
5. Determine whether the bank’s cost accounting system is capable of generating profit data 
by product, segment (including grade), channel, and account. 
 
 
                                                           
85 The bank’s return on assets is an indicator of how profitable the bank is relative to its total assets and can 
show how efficiently management uses its assets to generate earnings. Return on assets is calculated by dividing 
a bank’s annual earnings by its total assets. 
 
86 Return on equity means the amount of net income returned as a percentage of shareholders’ equity. 
Comptroller’s Handbook 
74 
Student Lending 
Examination Procedures > Supplemental Examination Procedures 
6. Assess the profitability of each product. 
 
• For each product, review profitability by credit score band, credit grade, sub-
portfolio, school, and vintage, as appropriate. 
• Compare actual results with projections and discuss variances with management. 
 
7. Evaluate profitability by channel. 
 
• Through discussions with the examiner responsible for third-party management, 
determine profitability generated through the various channels (e.g., third-party 
originators). 
• Compare the profitability of the loans generated by the various channels. 
 
8. Determine the adequacy of the pricing method. 
 
• Review the pricing strategy, pricing method, and pricing model, if applicable. 
• Review the major assumptions used in the pricing method and assess reasonableness. 
Be alert to differences in assumptions by product and channel. 
• Determine whether pricing is driven by risk, capital, or some other allocation method 
or hurdle, and how much, if any, it is driven by the competition. 
• Determine whether the pricing method incorporates a realistic break-even analysis, 
and whether the analysis reflects the true costs of prolonged deferment of student 
loans and default rates of certain student loan programs. 
• Review the pricing matrix, by product. 
 
9. Assess the adequacy of planning, reporting, and analysis with respect to deferment. 
Specifically, ascertain whether management identifies the volume and trends of student 
loans with high default rates relative to market to determine exposure and impact on 
earnings. 
 
10. Develop conclusions on the quantity, quality, and sustainability of earnings. 
 
Third-Party Relationship Risk Management 
 
Objective: To determine the extent of third-party involvement in student lending activities and 
evaluate the effectiveness of management’s third-party oversight and risk management 
processes. 
 
These procedures apply to any arrangements with third parties to provide student loan-related 
services to customers on the bank’s behalf. Banks may fully “outsource” loan originations, 
servicing, collection activities (using collection agencies or attorneys), or the offering of 
products in the bank’s name. 
 
Refer to OCC Bulletin 2013-29, “Third-Party Relationships: Risk Management Guidance,” 
for additional information on OCC expectations. 
 
Comptroller’s Handbook 
75 
Student Lending 
Examination Procedures > Supplemental Examination Procedures 
1. Determine the adequacy of the bank’s third-party risk management program. 
 
• Assess the adequacy of the risk management policy and determine that analysis, 
documentation, and reporting requirements are clearly addressed. 
• Determine that management has designated an individual to be responsible for the 
program and has delegated the authority necessary for its effective administration to 
that individual. 
• Review the bank’s process for maintaining a complete list of third parties used by the 
bank. 
• Review the bank’s criteria for designating “significant” third parties according to the 
dollar amount of the contract, the importance of the service provided, and the 
potential risk involved in the activity. While the risk management program should 
address all third-party relationships, the OCC expects a more rigorous process to 
manage those third parties deemed significant. 
• Review the bank’s due diligence process and determine whether the process 
– provides for comprehensive, well-documented reviews by qualified staff. 
– identifies any potential conflicts of interest with bank directors, officers, staff, and 
their related interests. 
– addresses compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, including safety 
and soundness regulatory standards, and laws prohibiting lending discrimination 
and unfair or deceptive practices. 
 
2. Identify third parties that provide significant student loan services on the bank’s behalf, 
particularly those that provide loan origination and servicing of both private and FFELP 
runoff portfolios. Determine the bank’s relationship manager for each of those third 
parties. 
 
3. Verify that bank management’s expertise in the outsourced activities is sufficient to 
accurately identify and manage the risks involved. 
 
4. Determine whether management has adequate controls, including policies, procedures 
and monitoring controls, to avoid becoming involved with a third party engaged in 
discriminatory, unfair, deceptive, abusive, or predatory lending practices. If weaknesses 
or concerns are found, consult the bank’s EIC or compliance examiner. 
 
Note: For additional information, refer to the “Fair Lending” booklet of the 
Comptroller’s Handbook and OCC Advisory Letter 2002-3, “Guidance on Unfair or 
Deceptive Acts or Practices.” 
 
5. Assess the adequacy of contract management, focusing on the process for ensuring that 
clauses necessary to effectively manage the third parties are included. 
 
• Determine whether the bank has a current contract on file for all third parties and that 
the bank monitors key dates (e.g., maturity, renewal, and adjustment periods). 
• Review a sample of contracts with significant third parties to confirm that the 
contracts satisfactorily address the following: 
Comptroller’s Handbook 
76 
Student Lending 
Examination Procedures > Supplemental Examination Procedures 
– Scope of the arrangement, including the frequency, content, and format of 
services provided by each party. 
– Outsourcing notifications or approvals required, if the third party proposes to 
subcontract a service to another party. 
– All costs and compensation, including any incentives. 
– Performance standards, including when standards can be adjusted and the 
consequences of failing to meet those standards. 
– Reporting and MIS requirements. 
– Data ownership and access. 
– Appropriate privacy and confidentiality restrictions. 
– Requirements for compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, including 
safety and soundness regulatory standards, and laws prohibiting lending 
discrimination and unfair or deceptive practices. 
– Mandatory third-party control functions such as quality assurance and audit, 
including requirements for submitting audit results to the bank. 
– Expectations and responsibilities for business resumption and contingency plans. 
– Responsibility for consumer complaint resolution and associated reporting to the 
bank. 
– Third-party financial statement submission requirements. 
– Appropriate dispute resolution, liability, recourse, penalty, indemnification, and 
termination clauses. 
– The authority for the bank to perform on-site third-party reviews. Third-party 
performance of services is subject to OCC examination oversight. 
• Determine whether the bank’s monitoring of third parties’ adherence to the bank’s 
contracts (especially to financial terms and performance standards) is adequate in 
frequency and scope. 
• Determine whether issues identified through the monitoring process are appropriately 
resolved in a timely manner. 
 
6. Assess the adequacy of the monitoring process for significant third parties. 
 
• Using the sample of significant third parties reviewed in the previous procedure, 
confirm that the bank’s oversight incorporates, at a minimum, 
– reports evidencing the third party’s performance relative to service-level 
agreements and other contract provisions. 
– customer complaints and resolutions for the services and products outsourced. 
– third-party financial statements and audit reports. 
– compliance with applicable laws and regulations. 
• Evaluate whether the process results in an accurate determination of whether 
contractual terms and conditions are being met, and whether any revisions to service-
level agreements or other terms are needed. 
• Verify whether management documents and follows up on performance, operational, 
or compliance problems and whether the documentation and follow-ups are timely 
and effective. 
• Determine whether the relationship manager or other bank staff periodically meets 
with its third parties to discuss performance and operational issues. 
Comptroller’s Handbook 
77 
Student Lending 
Examination Procedures > Supplemental Examination Procedures 
• Determine whether third-party risk management administers call monitoring, mystery 
shopper, customer callback, or customer satisfaction programs, if appropriate. 
• Assess the adequacy of the bank’s process for determining when on-site reviews are 
warranted, the scope of those reviews, and reporting of results. 
• Determine whether management evaluates the third party’s ongoing ability to perform 
the contracted functions in a satisfactory manner based on performance and financial 
condition. 
 
7. For third-party loan originators, 
 
• assess the adequacy of the process used to qualify third parties for loan origination. 
• assess the adequacy of the reports and tracking mechanisms in place to monitor 
performance (e.g., volume of applications submitted, approved, and booked; quality; 
exceptions; and loan performance) and relationship profitability, including 
performance and profitability compared with projections. 
• assess the adequacy of the process used to monitor compliance with the bank’s 
lending policies, and applicable laws and regulations. 
• verify that management maintains a watch list for problematic originators and that 
actions taken (including termination of the relationship, if warranted) are appropriate 
and timely. 
 
8. Assess the adequacy of the content, accuracy, and distribution of third-party management 
program reports. 
 
9. Determine whether the bank has any loans to the third party and whether any other 
conflicts of interest exist. 
 
10. Determine whether any insiders have relationships with the third parties used by the bank 
and whether any potential conflicts of interest exist (e.g., insider has ownership interests, 
officer or board positions, or loans to the third party). 
 
11. Determine whether the bank is involved in any significant third-party relationships where 
deficiencies in management expertise or controls result in the failure to adequately 
identify and manage the associated risk. If so, consult with the EIC and the supervisory 
office and determine whether it is appropriate to require that the activity be suspended 
pending satisfactory corrective action. 
 
12. Develop conclusions on the extent of third-party involvement in student lending activities 
and the effectiveness of management’s third-party oversight and risk management 
processes. Include any Education Department servicer review findings. Clearly document 
all findings.

Examination Procedures > Internal Control Questionnaire 
Internal Control Questionnaire 
 
An ICQ helps an examiner assess a bank’s internal controls for an area. ICQs typically 
address standard controls that provide day-to-day protection of bank assets and financial 
records. The examiner decides the extent to which it is necessary to complete or update ICQs 
during examination planning or after reviewing the findings and conclusions of the core 
assessment. 
 
Policies 
 
1. Has the board of directors, consistent with its duties and responsibilities, adopted written 
policies that established 
 
• procedures for reviewing student loan applications? 
• standards for determining loan amounts? 
• minimum standards for documentation? 
• standards for collection procedures? 
 
2. Are policies reviewed at least annually to determine that they are compatible with 
changing market conditions, the bank’s risk profile, and the bank’s strategic plan? 
 
Underwriting and Scoring Models 
 
3. Does audit or internal loan review test compliance with student loan underwriting 
standards? 
 
4. Are underwriting standards periodically reviewed and revised? 
 
5. If credit scoring models are used, 
 
• are credit limits determined by cutoff scores? 
• are models periodically revalidated? 
• are there internal procedures governing overrides? 
 
6. Is data from the application tested for input accuracy to the bank’s account processing 
system? If so, what is the sample size and frequency of the test? 
 
7. Is an exception report produced and reviewed by management that includes student loan 
deferment, extensions, forbearance, restructure, modification, or other factors that would 
result in a change in customer account status? 
 
8. Does the student lending operation prepare a budget by 
 
• function (e.g., collections or application processing)? 
• program (e.g., graduate, undergraduate, or profession)? 
Comptroller’s Handbook 
81 
Student Lending 
Examination Procedures > Internal Control Questionnaire 
• overall line of business? 
 
9. Are actual results compared to budget at least monthly? 
 
10. Are significant trends and deviations adequately explained in the financial review 
process? 
 
11. Do asset securitizations receive appropriate approval? 
 
12. Are collection programs for securitized loans appropriate? 
 
13. Does management have a plan to ensure adequate funding for maturing securitizations? 
 
Risk Management 
 
14. Does management develop and maintain student lending underwriting and account 
management guidelines? 
 
15. Does management monitor adherence to those guidelines? 
 
16. Does management ascertain the quality of the portfolio and assign risk ratings? 
 
17. Does management periodically review policies and procedures for adequacy and assess 
their impact on portfolio quality? 
 
18. Does management adequately assess the integrity of scoring systems and other models in 
use? 
 
Conclusion 
 
19. Is the foregoing information an adequate basis for evaluating internal controls in that 
there are no significant additional internal auditing procedures, accounting controls, 
administrative controls, or other circumstances that impair any controls or mitigate any 
weaknesses indicated above? (Explain negative answers briefly and indicate conclusions 
as to their effect on specific examination or verification procedures). 
 
20. Based on the answers to the foregoing questions, internal control for student lending is 
considered (strong, satisfactory, insufficient, or weak). 
 
Comptroller’s Handbook

Student Lending 
Examination Procedures > Verification Procedures 
Verification Procedures 
 
Verification procedures are used to verify the existence of assets and liabilities, or test the 
reliability of financial records. Examiners generally do not perform verification procedures as 
part of a typical examination. Rather, verification procedures are performed when substantive 
safety and soundness concerns are identified that are not mitigated by the bank’s risk 
management systems and internal controls. 
 
Objective: To verify the authenticity of the bank’s student loans and test the accuracy of records 
and adequacy of record keeping. 
 
Note: Examiners normally do not need to perform extensive verification. These procedures, 
however, are appropriate when the bank has inadequate audit coverage of student lending 
activities or when fraud or other irregularities are suspected. 
 
1. Test the additions of the trial balances and the reconciliation of the trial balances to the 
general ledger. Include loan commitments and other contingent liabilities. 
 
2. After selecting loans from the trial balance by using an appropriate sampling technique 
(refer to the “Sampling Methodologies” booklet of the Comptroller’s Handbook for 
guidance on sampling techniques), 
 
• prepare and mail confirmation forms to borrowers. (Loans serviced by other 
institutions, either whole loans or participations, are usually confirmed only with the 
servicing institution. Loans serviced for other institutions, either whole loans or 
participations, should be confirmed with the buying institution and the borrower. 
Confirmation forms should include borrower’s name, loan number, the original 
amount, interest rate, current loan balance, and borrower status). 
• after a reasonable time, mail second requests. 
• follow up on any unanswered requests for verification or exceptions and resolve 
differences. 
• examine notes for completeness and compare agree date, amount, and terms with trial 
balance. 
• in the event notes are not held at the bank, request confirmation by the holder. 
• check to see that required officer approvals are on the note. 
• check to see that note is signed, appears to be genuine, and is negotiable. 
 
3. Review accounts with accrued interest by 
 
• reviewing and testing procedures for accounting for accrued interest and for handling

Appendix A: Transaction Testing 
 
Overview 
 
Examiners should perform testing procedures when the EIC determines that the OCC should 
verify a bank’s compliance with its own policies and procedures or with regulatory policies, 
regulations, or laws. The EIC institutes testing when deemed appropriate to assess the bank’s 
risk selection, the accuracy of the bank’s MIS, or the accuracy of its loan accounting and 
servicing. Testing procedures usually are performed periodically on student loan portfolios or 
targeted segments of the portfolios, and when there is elevated risk (e.g., loans to students 
attending for-profit schools), an increase in delinquency and loss rates, new student loan 
programs, new acquisition channels, or rapid growth, or when loan review or audit is 
inadequate. 
 
Examiners conducting testing should be alert for potential discriminatory, unfair, deceptive, 
abusive, or predatory lending practices (e.g., providing misleading disclosures). If 
weaknesses are found or other concerns arise, consult the bank’s EIC or compliance 
examiner. 
 
These procedures recommend judgmental sample sizes. Sample sizes are suggestions only. 
The sample size and targeted portfolio segment may be modified to fit the circumstances. 
The sample selected should be sufficient in size to reach a supportable conclusion. Increase 
the sample size if questions arise and more evidence is needed to support the conclusion. 
 
Examiners may want to consider using a statistical sampling process for reaching conclusions 
on an entire portfolio. Performing statistically valid transaction testing on portfolios of 
homogeneous retail accounts is extremely effective. The benefits of statistical sampling allow 
the examiner to quantify the results of transaction testing and state with a statistically valid 
level of confidence that the results are reliable. For additional information, consult the 
“Sampling Methodologies” booklet of the Comptroller’s Handbook. 
 
Note: Appropriate sample size may vary based on the volume and complexity of the bank’s 
private student lending activities.

Appendix C: Uniform Retail Credit Classification 
and Account Management Policy Checklist 
 
When using the Uniform Retail Credit Classification and Account Management Policy 
checklist, comment only in areas that apply to private student lending. 
 
Uniform Retail Credit Classification and Account Management Policy (RCCP) 
Policy Applicability 
• 
Open- and closed-end credit extended to individuals for household, family, and other personal 
expenditures, including consumer loans, student loans, and credit cards. 
• 
Loans to individuals secured by their personal residences, including first mortgage, home equity, and 
home improvement loans. 
Note Regarding Minimum Policy Guidelines 
• 
The RCCP does not preclude examiners from classifying individual loans or entire portfolios regardless of 
delinquency status or criticizing account management practices that are deficient or improperly managed. 
If underwriting standards, risk management, or account management standards are weak and present 
unreasonable credit risk, deviation from the minimum classification guidelines outlined in the policy may 
be prudent. 
• 
Credit losses should be recognized when the bank becomes aware of the loss, but in no case should the 
charge-off exceed the time frames stated in the policy.

Substandard Classification 
1. 
Does the bank consider open- and closed-end retail loans 90 
cumulative days past due substandard? 
2. 
When a bank does not hold the senior mortgage on home equity loans, 
does the bank consider the loans substandard if they are 90 days or 
more past due, even if the loan-to-value is 60 percent or less? 
Note: The policy states that properly secured residential real estate 
loans with loan-to-value ratios of 60 percent or less may not need to be 
classified based solely on delinquency. 
3. 
For borrowers in bankruptcy and where the bank can clearly 
demonstrate that repayment is likely to occur, does the bank classify 
these loans as substandard until the borrower re-establishes his or her 
ability and willingness to repay for at least six months? 
 
 
Loss Classification 
1. 
Are unsecured closed-end retail loans charged off in the month they 
become 120 cumulative days past due? 
2. 
Are secured closed-end retail loans secured by other than real estate 
collateral charged off in the month they become 120 cumulative days 
past due? 
3. 
If the answer to #2 is no, are these loans written down to the value of 
the collateral, less cost to sell, if repossession of collateral is assured 
and in process? 
4. 
For open- and closed-end loans secured by residential real estate, is a 
current assessment of value made no later than when the account is 
180 days past due? 
5. 
For loans under #4, is any loan balance in excess of the value of the 
property, less cost to sell, charged off? 
 
 
Bankruptcy 
1. 
Are loans in bankruptcy charged off within 60 days of receipt of 
notification of filing from the bankruptcy court or within the 120- or 180-
day time frame (whichever is shorter)?

2. 
Are loans with collateral written down to the value of collateral, less cost 
to sell? 
3. 
When a loan’s balance is not charged off, does the bank classify it as 
substandard until the borrower reestablishes the ability and willingness 
to repay for a period of at least six months? 
 
 
Fraudulent Loans 
• 
Are fraudulent loans classified loss and charged off within 90 days of 
discovery or within the 120- to 180-day time frame (whichever is 
shorter)? 
 
 
Deceased Accounts 
• 
Are loans of deceased persons classified loss and charged off when the 
loss is determined or within the 120- to 180-day time frame (whichever 
is shorter)? 
 
 
Other Considerations for Classification 
• 
Under what conditions would the bank not classify (substandard or loss) 
a loan in accordance with the policy? 
Note: The policy permits nonclassification if the bank can document 
that the loan is well-secured and in the process of collection, such that 
collection will occur regardless of delinquency status. 
 
 
Partial Payments 
1. 
Does the bank require that a payment be equivalent to 90 percent or 
greater of the contractual payment before counting the payment as a full 
payment? 
2. 
As an alternative, does the bank aggregate payments and give credit for 
any partial payments received? 
3. 
Are controls in place to prevent both methods above from being used 
simultaneously on the same credit? 
 
 
Re-Aging, Extensions, Deferrals, Renewals, and Rewrites 
1. 
Are these types of activities only permitted when the action is based on 
a renewed willingness and ability to repay the loan? 
2. 
Does documentation show that the bank communicated with the 
borrower, the borrower agreed to pay the loan in full, and the borrower 
has the ability to repay the loan? 
3. 
Does MIS separately identify the number of accounts and dollar amount 
that have been re-aged, extended, deferred, renewed, or rewritten, 
including the number of times such action has been taken? 
4. 
How does the bank monitor and track the volume and performance of 
loans that have been re-aged, extended, deferred, renewed, rewritten, 
or placed in a workout program? 
Note: Requirements 1 through 4 do not apply to customer-service-
originated extensions or program extensions (such as holiday skip-a-
pay). Examples of how the bank would determine and document the 
borrower’s willingness and ability to repay could include such items as 
credit bureau score and data being obtained and reviewed, stated 
income being verified, and obtaining a “hardship” letter from the 
borrower.

Open-End Credit (Re-Aging) 
1. 
Is a reasonable written policy in place and adhered to? 
2. 
To be considered for re-aging, does the account exhibit the following: 
• 
Has the borrower demonstrated a renewed willingness and ability 
to repay the loan? 
• 
Has the account existed for at least nine months? 
• 
Has the borrower made at least three consecutive minimum 
monthly payments or the equivalent cumulative amount? 
• 
Does the bank prohibit the advancement of funds to make the 
minimum payment requirements? 
• 
Does the bank limit the number of re-ages to no more than once 
within any 12-month period? 
• 
Does the bank limit the frequency of re-ages to no more than twice 
within any five-year period? 
• 
For over-limit accounts that the bank re-ages, does the bank 
prohibit new credit from being extended until the balance falls 
below the pre-delinquency credit limit? 
3. 
To be considered prudent, does the bank’s workout loan program 
• 
require the receipt of at least three consecutive minimum monthly 
payments or the equivalent cumulative amount, as agreed to in the 
workout or debt management program, before re-aging an account 
that enters a workout program (internal or third party)? 
• 
limit re-ages to once in a five-year period? 
• 
have MIS that at a minimum tracks the principal reductions and 
charge-off history of loans in workout programs by type of 
program? 
 
 
Closed-End Credit (Standards, Controls, and MIS Required for Each 
Area) 
1. 
Has the bank adopted and adhered to explicit standards that control the 
use of extensions, deferrals, renewals, and rewrites? 
2. 
Do the standards include the following: 
• 
Has the borrower shown a renewed willingness and ability to repay 
the loan? 
• 
Do the standards limit the number and frequency of extensions, 
deferrals, renewals, and rewrites? 
• 
Are additional advances to finance unpaid interest and fees 
prohibited? 
3. 
At a minimum, do MIS track the subsequent principal reductions and 
charge-off history of loans that have been granted an extension, 
deferral, renewal, or rewrite?

Appendix D: Loss Forecasting Tool 
 
Reliable forecasts of expected consumer charge-offs are critical for risk management, 
profitability, reserving, and capitalization. This appendix describes the three most common 
methods: roll rate models, historical averaging, and vintage-based forecasting. Some banks 
use combinations of all three methods for different consumer portfolios or forecasting 
purposes.

Roll rate models are the most accurate short-term forecast technique. The name is derived 
from the practice of measuring the percentage of delinquent loans that migrate or “roll” from 
early delinquency to late-stage delinquency buckets, or to charge-off. The most common 
method is the delinquency roll rate model, in which dollars outstanding are stratified by 
delinquency status—typically, current, 30 to 59 days past due, 60 to 89 days past due, and so 
on through charge-off. The rates at which loans migrate or roll through delinquency levels 
are then used to project losses for the current portfolio. Figure 1 describes the mechanics of 
using roll rate analysis to track the migration of balances over a four-month period (120-day 
charge-off period). 
 
Figure 1: Roll Rate Schematic 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Step 1: Calculate roll rates 
 
Step 1 is to calculate the roll rates. The following computation (figures 2 and 3) begins with 
the $725 million in loans that were current in June 2014. From June 2014 to July 2014, 
$27 million in loans migrated from current to 30 days delinquent, which equates to a roll rate 
of 3.73 percent ($27 ÷ $725). From July 2014 to August 2014, $10.6 million rolled to the 
next delinquency bucket, representing a 39.26 percent roll rate ($10.6 ÷ $27). Continuing 
along the shaded, stair-stepped boxes in the following table, loss rates increase in the latter 
stages of delinquency. To smooth out some fluctuations in the data, management often 
averages roll rates by quarter before making current portfolio forecasts, and compares 
quarterly roll rate results between quarters to analyze and adjust for seasonal effects. 
 
The schematic and example in figures 2 and 3 are simplified depictions of dollar flow to 
illustrate the basic concept of roll rates. In reality, some balances cure (return to current), 
remain in the same delinquency bucket, or improve to a less severe delinquency status by the 
end of a period. For ease of calculation, roll rate analysis assumes all dollars at the end of a 
period flow from the previous period bucket.

Step 2: Calculate loss factors by bucket 
 
Step 2 is to calculate loss factors for each bucket. To calculate the loss factor from the 
“current” bucket, multiply all average roll rates from the most recent quarterly average. In 
this example, the fourth quarter average roll rates produce this factor: 3.42% x 42.58% x 
67.12% x 72.12%, resulting in a 0.70 percent loss rate for loans in the current bucket. To 
determine the loss rate for the 30-day accounts, multiply the most recent quarterly averages 
for the 60-, 90-, and 120-day buckets, resulting in a loss factor of 20.61 percent. Applying the 
same method results in a loss factor of 48.41 percent for the 60-day bucket and 72.12 percent 
for the 90-day bucket. 
 
Step 3: Apply loss factors to the current portfolio

Step 3 is to forecast losses for the existing portfolio by applying the loss factors for each 
bucket (developed in step 2) to the current portfolio. In this example, the portfolio’s expected 
loss rate over the next four months is 2.93 percent. 
 
The major advantage of roll rate analysis is its relative simplicity and considerable accuracy 
out to nine months. Portfolios are often segmented by product, customer type, or other 
relevant groupings to increase precision and accuracy. Collection managers use roll rate 
reports extensively to anticipate workload and staffing needs and to assess and adjust 
collection strategies. 
 
The main limitation of roll rates is that the predictive power of delinquency roll rate declines 
after nine months. The delinquency focus causes forecasts to lag underlying changes in 
portfolio quality, especially in the relatively large current bucket. Portfolio quality changes 
occur because of such factors as underwriting and cutoff score adjustments, product mix 
changes, and shifts in economic conditions. Roll rate analysis may underestimate loss 
exposure when these factors cause portfolio quality to weaken. Finally, roll rate methodology 
assumes loans migrate through an orderly succession of delinquency stages before charge-
off. In actuality, customers often migrate to charge-off status after sporadic payments or rush 
to that status by declaring bankruptcy. 
 
Historical 
 
Historical averaging is a rudimentary method for forecasting loss rates. Management tracks 
historical charge-offs, adjusts for recent loss experience trends, and adds some qualitative 
recognition of current economic conditions or changes in portfolio mix. This method is 
highly judgmental and is used primarily by less sophisticated banks, or for stable, 
conservatively underwritten products. The most common of these products are residential 
mortgages when the collateral protection is conservative or the loans carry some sort of third-
party guaranty or insurance. 
 
The method is sometimes used for allowance purposes and monitoring general product or 
portfolio trends. The advantage is simplicity, and data needs are modest. Results can be 
reasonably accurate as long as underwriting standards remain relatively constant and 
economic or competitive conditions do not change markedly. The major limitation is that 
forecasts will lag behind underlying changes in portfolio quality if competitive or economic 
conditions change. The judgmental nature of the process introduces potential bias by 
allowing forecasters to rely on longer run averages when conditions deteriorate and short-run 
trends at the earliest signs of recovery, either of which results in lower loss estimates. In 
addition, the method does not provide meaningful information on the effects of changes in 
product or customer mix, and it is difficult to apply any but the most basic stress tests. 
 
Vintage 
 
Vintage-based forecasting tracks delinquency and loss curves by time on books as different 
vintages or marketing campaign seasons. The patterns or curves are predictive for future 
vintages, if adjustments are made for changes in underwriting criteria, altered cutoffs, and 
Comptroller’s Handbook

economic conditions. The advantage of vintage-based forecasting is that its accuracy is 
usually better than roll rate forecasts for charge-offs beyond a one-year horizon, if the need 
for adjustments is readily observed. Management should adjust the future loss expectations 
when new vintages are observed to deviate markedly from past curves and trajectories, or if 
economic and market conditions change. The disadvantages of vintage-based forecasting are 
that it is more subjective and less accurate than roll rates for short-term forecasting and that it 
relies on the assumption that new vintages will perform similarly to older vintages.

websites, including FinAid. 
 
Academic year: The period during which school is in session, consisting of at least 30 weeks 
of instructional time. The academic year typically runs from approximately the beginning of 
September through the end of May at most colleges and universities. 
 
Allowance for loan and lease losses (ALLL): A valuation reserve that represents an 
estimate of uncollectible amounts (probable and incurred losses) that is used to reduce the 
book value of loans and leases to the amount that is expected to be collected. The allowance 
is established and maintained by charges against the bank’s operating income, that is, the 
provision expense. 
 
Amortization: The process of gradually repaying a loan over a period of time through 
periodic installments of principal and interest. 
 
Award letter: An official document issued by a school’s financial aid office that lists all of 
the financial aid awarded to the student. 
 
Award year: The academic year for which financial aid is requested (or received). The 
period from July 1 of a given calendar year through June 30 of the following calendar year. 
 
Bankruptcy: Judicial action to stay the normal collection of debts against the petitioner and 
cause those debts deemed to be satisfied at the direction of the court. Bankruptcies are 
classified under the U.S. Code by “chapters,” which refer to parts of the U.S. Bankruptcy 
Code. 
 
Campus-based programs: The Federal Perkins Loan, Federal Work-Study, and Federal 
Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant programs. These programs and their related 
funds are administered directly by a school’s financial aid office. In return, the school is 
allowed to retain a percentage of each program’s funds for its administrative costs. Awards 
are made from a fixed pool of money. 
 
Cancellation: Loan cancellation ends the obligation to repay the debt and typically involves 
the discharge or forgiveness of the loan balance (including any accrued but unpaid interest). 
 
Capitalization: The practice of adding unpaid interest charges to the principal balance of a 
loan. Interest is then charged on the new balance, including both the unpaid principal and the 
accrued interest. 
 
Cohort default rate (CDR): The percentage of borrowers in the cohort who default on 
certain loans made under federal student loan programs before the end of the second fiscal 
year after the fiscal year in which they entered repayment on their loans. The Education 
Comptroller’s Handbook

Department releases information on CDRs annually. For more information on the CDR and 
how it is calculated, refer to the Education Department’s website. 
 
Collection agency: A company often hired by the lender or guarantee agency to recover 
defaulted loans. 
 
Consolidation loan: Also called loan consolidation, a consolidation loan combines several 
student loans into one larger loan from a single lender. The consolidation loan is like a 
refinance and is used to pay off the balances on the other loans. 
 
Cosigner: Any person who assumes personal liability, in any capacity, for the obligation of a 
borrower without receiving goods, services, or money in return for the obligation. The 
cosigner is equally and severally liable and is expected to make payments on the primary 
borrower’s debt should that person default. 
 
Cost of attendance: An estimate of the student’s educational expenses for the period of 
enrollment. 
 
Credit history: A credit history is a record of all events connected with payment of a set of 
debts, such as on-time payments, late payments, nonpayment, default, liens, and bankruptcy 
discharge. A credit history can include both current and previous credit accounts and their 
balances, employment and personal information, and history of past credit problems. 
 
Credit scoring: A statistical method for predicting the creditworthiness of applicants and 
existing customers. 
 
Default: A loan is in default when the borrower fails to pay several regular installments on 
time or otherwise fails to meet the terms and conditions of the loan. A borrower who is 
120 days late on a private student loan or 270 days late on a federal education loan is 
considered to be in default. 
 
Default fee: Synonymous with guarantee fee. A guarantee is an agreement to purchase title 
to a loan if the borrower defaults on his or her obligation to repay the debt. 
 
Deferment: Occurs when a borrower is allowed to postpone repaying the loan. 
 
Delinquent: A period that begins on the day after the due date of a payment when the 
borrower fails to make a full payment. 
 
Dependency status: A measure of the degree to which a student has access to his or her 
parents’ financial resources. 
 
Direct loans: The William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program (Direct Loan Program) is a 
federal program in which the school becomes the lending agency and manages the funds 
directly, with the federal government providing the loan funds. The terms for direct loans are 
the same as for loans issued under the Stafford Loan program. 
Comptroller’s Handbook 
102 
Student Lending 
Appendixes > Appendix E 
Direct Parental Loans for Undergraduate Students (Direct PLUS Loans): A federal 
student loan available to graduate or professional degree students and parents of dependent 
undergraduate students to help pay education expenses. Parents may borrow up to the full 
cost of their children’s education, minus the amount of any other financial aid received. 
Direct PLUS Loans may be used to pay the expected family contribution. There is a minimal 
credit check required for the Direct PLUS loan. 
 
Disbursement: The transfer of loan proceeds by individual check, master check, or 
electronic funds transfer by a lender to a borrower, a school, or an escrow agent. 
 
Discharge: The release of a borrower or any cosigner from all or a portion of his or her loan 
obligation. 
 
Disclosure statement: Provides the borrower with information about the actual cost of the 
loan, including the interest rate, origination, insurance, loan fees, and any other types of 
finance charges. Lenders are required to provide the borrower with a disclosure statement 
before issuing a loan. 
 
Electronic data exchange: Program used by participating schools to receive Student Aid 
Reports electronically from the federal processor. At some schools, this program allows 
students to file their FAFSA electronically. 
 
Enrollment status: An indication of whether a student is attending school full time or part 
time. 
 
Entitlement: Entitlement programs award money to all qualified applicants. The Pell Grant 
is an example of such a program. The Individuals With Disabilities Education Act Federal 
Special Education Entitlement Grant is another example. 
 
Expanded lending option: Under this option, some schools can offer higher annual and 
cumulative loan limits to students receiving a Perkins Loan. The expanded lending option is 
restricted to schools with a Perkins Loan default rate of 15 percent or less. 
 
Expected family contribution (EFC): The amount a student and the student’s spouse or 
family are expected to pay toward the student’s cost of attendance. 
 
Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP): A discontinued student loan program 
authorized by Title IV, part B, of the HEA, as amended. FFELP included subsidized and 
unsubsidized Stafford, Direct PLUS, and consolidation loans. These loans were funded by 
lenders, guaranteed by guarantors, and reinsured by the Education Department. 
 
Federal methodology: The need analysis formula used to determine the EFC. The federal 
methodology takes into account the family size, the number of family members in college, 
taxable and nontaxable income, and assets. Unlike most institutional methodologies, the 
federal methodology does not consider the net value of the family residence.

Financial aid: Money provided to the student and the family to help them pay for the 
student’s education, which is conditioned on the student’s attendance at an educational 
institution. Major forms of financial aid include gift aid (grants and scholarships) and self-
help aid (loans and work). 
 
Financial Aid Administrator: A staff member at an eligible school who administers 
financial aid programs. 
 
Financial Aid Office: The college or university office that is responsible for determining 
financial need and awarding financial aid. 
 
Financial aid package: The total amount of financial aid that a school awards a student. 
Federal and nonfederal aid such as loans, grants, or work-study are combined into a 
“package” to help meet the student’s cost of attendance. Using available resources to give 
each student the best possible aid package is one of the major responsibilities of a school’s 
financial aid administrator. 
 
Financial aid transcript: An official record of the federal financial aid that a student 
received at schools the student previously attended. The record is used to assess the amount 
of federal financial aid the student has received and to prevent the award of federal funds for 
which the student or the parent of a dependent student is not eligible. The record may be 
obtained from the NSLDS or may be a paper report received from the previous schools. 
 
Forbearance: A period of time during which the borrower is permitted to temporarily cease 
making payments or reduce the amount of the payments for reasons including certain types 
of financial hardships. The borrower is liable for the interest that accrues on the loan during 
the forbearance period. 
 
Forgiveness: Loan forgiveness releases the borrower from his or her obligation to repay the 
loan, usually due to circumstances within the borrower’s control. For student loans, the most 
common loan forgiveness programs cancel all or part of the debt for working in a particular 
field or performing military or volunteer service. Loan forgiveness for working in a particular 
occupation is tax-free; other types of loan forgiveness may result in a tax liability. There are 
two main types of loan forgiveness: up-front and back-end. Up-front loan forgiveness cancels 
a portion of the debt for each year of service. Back-end loan forgiveness cancels any 
remaining debt after a specified number of years of service. Forgiveness is a type of loan 
cancellation. 
 
Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA): The form the student must complete 
to apply for federal Title IV financial assistance, including Stafford Loans. The student must 
include financial information about the student’s household so that the EFC can be 
calculated. 
 
Garnishment: The practice of withholding a portion of a defaulted borrower’s wages to 
repay his or her loan, without consent.

Appendixes > Appendix E 
Grace period: A time period after graduation during which the borrower is not required to 
begin repaying his or her student loans. The grace period may also apply if the borrower 
leaves school for a reason other than graduation or drops below half-time enrollment. 
Depending on the type of loan, a borrower has a grace period of six months (Stafford Loans 
and private student loans) or nine months (Perkins Loans) before the borrower must start 
making payments. PLUS Loans do not have a grace period. CNBE Policy Guidance 2010-2 
(REV), “Policy Interpretation: OCC Bulletin 2000-20—Application to Private Student 
Lending,” allows a grace period of six months for private student loans, with an additional 
six-month extended grace period if the borrower can document financial hardship. 
 
Graduated repayment schedule: A repayment schedule under which the borrower pays 
lower initial monthly payments that gradually increase (usually in two or more increments) 
during the course of the repayment period. For federal student loans, the graduated 
repayment schedule cannot exceed 10 years (or 25 years for borrowers eligible for an 
extended repayment schedule), excluding in-school, grace, deferment, and forbearance 
periods. 
 
Grant: A type of financial aid based on financial need that the student does not have to 
repay. 
 
Guarantee: A guarantee is an agreement to purchase title to a loan if the borrower defaults 
on his or her obligation to repay the debt. 
 
Guarantee agency or guarantor: State agencies responsible for approving student loans 
and insuring them against default. Guarantee agencies also oversee the student loan process 
and enforce federal and state rules regarding student loans. 
 
Guarantee fee: A small percentage of the loan that is paid to the guarantee agency to insure 
the loan against default. The insurance fee is usually 1 percent of the loan amount. Also 
known as a default fee. 
 
Half time: An enrollment status under which a student in an undergraduate program is 
carrying an academic workload that includes at least half of the academic workload of the 
required minimum full-time enrollment standard for that program. 
 
Income-Based Repayment Plan: A repayment plan available to a borrower who has a 
partial financial hardship or is paying a permanent-standard payment amount after qualifying 
for such a hardship. If a lender determines that a borrower has a partial hardship, the 
borrower’s monthly payment amount on eligible loans is limited to 15 percent of the amount 
by which the borrower’s annual adjusted gross income exceeds 150 percent of the U.S. 
Department of Health and Human Services’ poverty guideline for the borrower’s family size. 
The Education Department repays the outstanding balance and accrued interest on eligible 
FFELP and direct loans after 25 years and a combination of 300 months covered by 
qualifying payments or economic hardship deferments, beginning no earlier than July 1, 
2009. 
 
Comptroller’s Handbook 
105 
Student Lending 
Appendixes > Appendix E 
Income-Contingent Repayment Plan: A repayment schedule for some Direct Loan 
Program loans under which the borrower’s monthly payment amount is adjusted annually, 
based on the total amount of the borrower’s direct loans, the borrower’s family size, and the 
adjusted gross income reported on the borrower’s most recent income tax return. In the case 
of a married borrower who files a joint income tax return, the adjusted gross income includes 
the spouse’s income. 
 
Income-Sensitive Repayment Plan: A repayment schedule for some FFELP loans under 
which the borrower’s monthly payment amount is adjusted annually, based solely on the 
borrower’s expected total monthly gross income received from employment and other 
sources during the course of the repayment period. 
 
Independent student: An independent student is at least 24 years old as of January 1 of the 
academic year, is married, is a graduate or professional student, has a legal dependent other 
than a spouse, is a veteran of the U.S. Armed Forces, or is an orphan or ward of the court (or 
was a ward of the court until age 18). A parent refusing to provide support for his or her 
child’s education is not sufficient for the child to be declared independent. 
 
Lender subsidies: A set of arrangements established to encourage lenders to make federally 
guaranteed education loans. These arrangements include a federal guarantee against borrower 
default, special allowance payments, and lender-paid origination fees. 
 
LIBOR: The LIBOR, or London Interbank Offered Rate, is a variable rate index that 
typically reflects the rates that financial institutions charge one another for short-term loans. 
 
Loan servicer: A loan servicer is a business that collects payments on a loan and performs 
other administrative tasks associated with maintaining a loan portfolio. 
 
National credit bureau: A credit reporting agency with a service area encompassing more 
than a single region of the country. 
 
National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS): A database comprising information from 
guarantors, schools, lenders, and the Education Department on Title IV aid received by 
students. 
 
Out-of-pocket cost: Out-of-pocket cost is the difference between the cost of attendance and 
the grants, scholarships, and other gift aid in the need-based financial aid package. It reflects 
the bottom line cost to the family, that is, the amount the family will need to pay out of 
current and future resources, such as savings, income, and loans. Some nonprofit colleges 
that have adopted no-loans financial aid policies have lower out-of-pocket costs than many 
public colleges. Generally, families should evaluate college financial aid award letters using 
out-of-pocket cost. 
 
Out-of-state student: A student who has not met the legal residency requirements for the 
state and is often charged a higher tuition rate at public colleges and universities in the state 
than legal residents.

Overawards: A student who receives federal support may not receive awards totaling more 
than $400 in excess of his or her financial need. 
 
Packaging: The process of assembling a financial aid package. 
 
Parent contribution: An estimate of the portion of educational expenses that the federal 
government believes parents can afford. It is based on the parents’ income, the number of 
parents earning income, assets, family size, the number of family members currently 
attending a university or college, and other relevant factors. Students who qualify as 
independent are not expected to have a parent contribution. 
 
Participating school: An eligible school that meets the standards for participation in Title IV 
programs, has a current program participation agreement with the Education Department, and 
is eligible to receive funds under these programs. 
 
Pell Grant: A federal grant that provides up to $5,815 (in 2016–2017) based on the student’s 
financial need. 
 
Perkins Loan: Formerly the National Direct Student Loan Program, the Perkins Loan allows 
students to borrow up to $3,000 per year (up to a five-year maximum) for undergraduate 
school and $5,000 per year for graduate school (up to a six-year maximum). The Perkins 
Loan has one of the lowest interest rates and is awarded by the school’s financial aid 
administrator to students with exceptional financial need. The student must have applied for a 
Pell Grant to be eligible. The interest on the Perkins Loan is subsidized while the student is in 
school. 
 
Poverty line: The poverty guidelines, often referred to as the poverty line, are published 
annually by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The guidelines are a 
simplification of the poverty thresholds published annually by the U.S. Census Bureau. The 
poverty line is more often used in federal student aid, such as the Income-Based Repayment 
and Income-Contingent Repayment plans, as well as the economic hardship deferment. 
 
Preferred lender arrangement: An arrangement or agreement between a lender and a 
school or an institution-affiliated organization under which the lender provides or otherwise 
issues private education loans to students attending the school (or to the students’ families) 
and under which the school or institution-affiliated organization recommends, promotes, or 
endorses the lender’s education loan products. 
 
Prime lending rate: The prime lending rate is the interest rate offered by lenders to their 
best credit customers. 
 
Private student loans: Education loan programs without a guarantee from the federal 
government. 
 
Professional degree: A degree that signifies both completion of the academic requirements 
for beginning practice in a given profession and a level of professional skill beyond that

normally required for a bachelor’s degree. Professional licensure is also generally required. 
Examples of a professional degree include pharmacy (Pharm. D.), law (LLB or JD), and 
medicine (MD). 
 
Rehabilitation (of a defaulted loan): A process by which a borrower may bring a FFELP 
loan out of default by adhering to specified repayment requirements. 
 
Reinstatement (of borrower Title IV eligibility): A process by which a borrower with a 
defaulted FFELP loan may regain eligibility for Title IV aid by adhering to strict repayment 
requirements 
 
Repayment period: The period during which payments of principal and interest are 
required. The repayment period follows any applicable in-school or grace period. 
 
Satisfactory academic progress: The qualitative (grade point average) and quantitative 
(time limit) measures of a student’s progress toward completing a program of study. To 
maintain eligibility for Title IV aid, the student must show adequate progress. A school must 
establish policies regarding satisfactory academic progress and must check the progress of 
Title IV aid recipients at least once each academic year, or at the end of each payment period 
if the educational program is either one academic year in length or shorter than an academic 
year. 
 
Scholarship: A form of financial aid given to undergraduate students to help pay for their 
education. Most scholarships are restricted to paying all or part of tuition expenses, though 
some scholarships also cover room and board. Scholarships are a form of gift aid and do not 
have to be repaid. Many scholarships are restricted to students in specific courses of study or 
with academic, athletic, or artistic talent. 
 
Skip tracing: Diligent efforts to locate a borrower’s telephone number or address when such 
information is unknown. 
 
Special allowance payments: Special allowance payments were established for FFELP to 
ensure that education lenders received a market rate of return on federal education loans. 
Whenever the borrower interest rate on the federal education loans fell below market rates, 
the Education Department would make special allowance payments to the lenders based on 
the difference between the interest rates. 
 
Stafford Loans: Federal student loans that come in two forms, subsidized and unsubsidized. 
Subsidized loans are based on need, unsubsidized loans are not. The interest on a Subsidized 
Stafford Loan is paid by the federal government while the student is in school and during a 
six-month grace period. The Subsidized Stafford Loan was formerly known as the 
Guaranteed Student Loan. 
 
Student Aid Report: The paper output record provided to the student by the Education 
Department’s Central Processing System that includes information provided by the student 
on the FAFSA. The report also contains the student’s EFC and the results of federal database

matches. The electronic version that is sent to schools is called an Institutional Student 
Information Record. 
 
Subrogation: A transfer in the ownership of a defaulted FFELP loan from a guarantor to the 
Education Department. Loans to be subrogated must meet criteria established and revised 
annually by the department. 
 
Subsidized loan: A loan eligible for interest benefits paid by the federal government. The 
federal government pays the interest that accrues on subsidized loans during the student’s in-
school, authorized deferment, and (if applicable) post-deferment grace periods, if the loan 
meets certain eligibility requirements. 
 
Treasury offset: An interception by the U.S. Department of the Treasury or a state agency of 
any payment of applicable federal funds (tax refunds, Social Security benefits, federal 
retirement benefits, etc.) or state funds otherwise due a borrower who has defaulted on a 
FFELP loan. 
 
Troubled debt restructuring (TDR): A restructuring in which a bank, for economic or 
other reasons related to a borrower’s financial difficulties, grants a concession to the 
borrower that it would not otherwise consider. This includes a modification of the loan terms, 
such as a reduction of the stated interest rate, principal, or accrued interest or an extension of 
the maturity date at a stated interest rate lower than the current market rate for new debt with 
similar risk. 
 
U.S. Department of Education: The federal government agency that administers several 
federal student financial aid programs, including the Federal Pell Grant, the Federal Work-
Study Program, the Federal Perkins Loans, the Federal Stafford Loans, and the Federal PLUS 
Loans. 
 
William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program (Direct Loan Program): A student loan 
program authorized in 1992 by Title IV, part D, of the HEA, as amended. The Direct Loan 
program offers four components: Direct Subsidized Stafford Loans, Direct Unsubsidized 
Stafford Loans, Direct PLUS Loans, and Direct Consolidation Loans. The Direct Loan 
program is similar to the discontinued FFELP, except that loans are made by the Education 
Department rather than by private lending institutions.
