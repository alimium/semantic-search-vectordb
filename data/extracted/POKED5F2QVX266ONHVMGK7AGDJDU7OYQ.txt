BEFORE WE WELCOME OUR NEXT SPEAKER, I 
HAVE A BIT OF NEWS. 
 
UNFORTUNATELY, SOME LAST MINUTE CHANGES 
TO THE HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE SCHEDULE 
ARE PREVENTING CONGRESSMAN RANDY FORBES 
FROM JOINING US TODAY. 
 
HE SENDS HIS APOLOGIES AND BEST WISHES FOR 
OUR EFFORT.  
 
ALSO, ALTHOUGH WE’D INITIALLY SCHEDULED MR 
FOTIS KARAMITSOS (FOE-TISS  CAR-AH-MEAT-
ZOHS), TO SPEAK TODAY, AN URGENT FAMILY 
ISSUE REQUIRES THAT HE BE ELSEWHERE RIGHT 
NOW. 
 
HOWEVER, WE HAVE BEEN VERY FORTUNATE TO 
HAVE TWO KNOWLEDGEABLE SPEAKERS COMMIT 
ON SHORT NOTICE . . .   
 
1 
 
FIRST, WE HAVE WITH US A MAN WITH A WELL-
ROUNDED AND DEEP KNOWLEDGE OF U.S. 
TRANSPORTATION POLICY.  
 
HE SPENT NINE YEARS ON THE HILL – AS A STAFF 
MEMBER FOR THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON 
COMMERCE, SCIENCE AND TRANSPORTATION . . . 
AND THE HOUSE COMMITTEE ON TRANSPORTATION 
INFRASTRUCTURE.  
 
AND NOW HE’S A MAJOR ASSET TO US HERE AT 
THE D.O.T. 
 
HE CURRENTLY SERVES IN THE OFFICE OF THE 
ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR POLICY HERE AT THE 
DEPARTMENT, WHERE HE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR 
COORDINATING THE DEPARTMENT’S NATIONAL 
FREIGHT ACTIVITIES . . . INCLUDING MANAGING THE 
NATIONAL FREIGHT ADVISORY COMMITTEE. 
 
2 
 
HE ALSO OVERSEES THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE 
DEPARTMENT’S UPCOMING NATIONAL FREIGHT 
STRATEGIC PLAN AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF 
THE NATIONAL FREIGHT POLICY. 
 
PLEASE HELP ME WELCOME JOHN DRAKE! 
 
. . .  
. . .  
. . . 
 
THANK YOU, JOHN . . .  
 
IT WAS OUR INTENTION TO WIDEN HORIZONS WITH 
THIS SYMPOSIUM . . . AND GET MARITIME PLAYERS 
TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE BIGGER PICTURE IN THIS 
INDUSTRY.    
 
THAT’S WHY IT IS SUCH AN HONOR TO INTRODUCE 
OUR NEXT SPEAKER . . . A PERSON WHO CAN SHINE 
3 
 
SOME LIGHT ON MARITIME PRACTICES AND 
DEVELOPMENTS ACROSS THE ATLANTIC.  
 
HE HAS BEEN WITH THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION 
SINCE 2003, PLAYING A LEADING ROLE IN 
NUMEROUS RESEARCH, LOGISTICS AND ANALYSIS 
EFFORTS FOCUSING ON EUROPEAN INLAND 
WATERWAY TRANSPORT AND MARITIME 
SHIPPING… 
 
AMONG THESE, HE WAS A CENTRAL CONTRIBUTOR 
TO THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION’S 2011 WHITE 
PAPER ON TRANSPORT, A POLICY STRATEGY TO 
SERVE THE E.U. THROUGH 2021 . . .  
 
PLEASE JOIN ME IN GIVING A WARM WELCOME TO 
TRANSPORT COUNSELOR FOR THE EUROPEAN 
UNION DELEGATION TO THE UNITED STATES, DR
