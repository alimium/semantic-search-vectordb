  For Congressman Dave Obey, Friday afternoon's visit to East Elementary School was an
illustration of a few of the things he is campaigning for in Washington D.C.

  Obey, who represents Wisconsin's Seventh District, which includes Antigo, visited the school
for an update on the district's after school program. He secured $383,370 in federal funds last

  But instead of a dry recap of facts and statistics, school officials let the students do the talking,
and singing, and play-acting, sharing with the congressman everything from their newfound
knowledge of Spanish to anti-bullying tactics before presenting him with a homemade bouquet
of flowers.
  
  Obey, munching on a cookie and sipping some coffee, was clearly pleased.
  
  &quot;Research shows that when students have a place to go after school where they can
study and be supervised by an adult, not only are they less likely to get into trouble, they also
get a better education,&quot; he said. &quot;That's why we pushed for more funding for
after-school centers in the budget and why I asked for the funds to help keep programs like this
going in Wisconsin. I'm glad to be here today to see first hand how things are going here in
Antigo.&quot;
  
  The Antigo after-school program is intended to provide a safe, healthy, enriching, supervised
after-school environment for children in Antigo elementary schools. On average, about 100
students attend the program daily. The program is organized into four to six week sessions with
a theme and varied activities during each session. Ongoing activities include homework
assistance, tutoring, mentoring, physical fitness activities, field trips, and special monthly
&quot;Family Fun Nights.''
  
  &quot;There is nothing more important for the future of our children than a good
education,&quot; Obey noted. &quot;Offering extra help with homework, advanced tutoring and
an adult-supervised safe-haven free of trouble, after-school programs like this one help provide
students a solid foundation that will help them for the rest of their lives.&quot;
