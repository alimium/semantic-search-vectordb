GLOBALLY ENGAGED 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. DREIER) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I know 
that what I’m about to say may be seen 
as 
heresy 
by 
many—or 
at 
least 
counterintuitive—but, 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
this statement is based in fact: out-
sourcing is not decimating our econ-
omy. If we take a step back and look at 
the big picture, setting aside dema-
goguery and knee-jerk reactions, we 
see that engagement with the world-
wide marketplace is a positive thing 
for our economy and our shared quest 
to create good American jobs. 
Being globally engaged takes many 
forms. It includes exporting our goods 
overseas. It includes imports. It in-
cludes complex supply chains that 
allow us to maximize comparative ad-
vantage and productivity on a global 
scale. It demands innovation, cre-
ativity, and adaptability. This is all 
part of the dynamic worldwide market-
place, and it does not constitute a zero 
sum game. 
If a U.S. manufacturer can lower 
costs by importing some of their raw 
materials, increasing their competi-
tiveness and hiring more U.S. workers 
as a result, our job market improves. 
American workers benefit. By the same 
token, if a company can tap into other 
labor markets, becoming more com-
petitive in the process and then hiring 
more U.S. workers as a result, we can 
all benefit. 
This is not a hypothetical scenario. 
We have the data that demonstrates 
the clear benefits of engaging in the 
worldwide marketplace. The last time 
the issue of outsourcing became a po-
litical flash point was in 2004. We often 
heard this term, ‘‘Benedict Arnold 
CEOs’’ who were sending good U.S. jobs 
overseas. 
The McKinsey Global Institute did an 
in-depth analysis of the effect of out-
sourcing to see what impact it was ac-
tually having on our economy. What 
they found was very interesting. They 
found that companies that utilize out-
sourcing as a component of their busi-
ness plans enjoy new export opportuni-
ties, increased productivity, and sig-
nificant cost savings, all of which sup-
port new investment in the United 
States and greater job creation right 
here at home. Furthermore, the jobs 
that are created by globally engaged 
companies tend to be higher-skill, 
higher-waged jobs than those created 
by their nonglobally engaged counter-
parts. 
Mr. Speaker, the findings of the 
McKinsey report are only buttressed by 
my own firsthand experience. I’ll never 
forget, several years ago I was in 
Kathmandu visiting one of those call 
centers. Now, many would have viewed 
that 
call 
center 
as 
a 
symbol 
of 
outsourced jobs, and yet when I looked 
around, I found U.S. companies right 
there. I’m not claiming that all of 
these 
products 
were 
manufactured 
right here in the United States, but 
many were manufactured here in this 
hemisphere. They had names on them 
like Carrier air conditioners. There was 
a Westinghouse refrigerator there, Dell 
computers, 
and 
AT&T 
telephones. 
Rather than stealing jobs from Ameri-
cans and this hemisphere, this call cen-
ter epitomized the very way that glob-
al engagement benefits us all. 
It is simply inaccurate to claim that 
every job created overseas destroys a 
job here in the United States, and it 
completely misses the point. Rather 
than demonizing those who are trying 
to build competitive companies that 
grow our economy and create oppor-
tunity for Americans, we should be 
looking at what we can do to attract

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4160 
June 28, 2012 
I called for a hearing into the 
Lackland scandal because we need to 
know once and for all why instructors 
have been permitted to abuse power so 
freely. And we need to know from top 
brass that the phrase ‘‘zero tolerance 
for sexual assault in the military’’ is a 
fact, not a talking point. 
f 
the word of the accuser and the ac-
cused, the instructor against the train-
ee. In the military, this usually means 
the perpetrator gets off or receives a 
disproportionately small punishment, 
and the victim endures an arduous and 
humiliating legal process with little 
sense of justice at the end. 
Every day more disgusting news is 
unearthed about Lackland. Everyone 
wants to know: What is being done 
about it? 
This scandal is remarkably similar to 
the Aberdeen scandal that rocked the 
Army in the 1990s. Fifteen years ago, a 
Republican-led Senate held a hearing 
on a sex scandal at the Aberdeen Prov-
ing Ground in Maryland. 
RECESS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair 
declares the House in recess until noon 
today. 
Accordingly (at 10 o’clock and 12 
minutes a.m.), the House stood in re-
cess.

b 1200 
investment here to the United States. 
We should be looking at what we can 
do to empower entrepreneurs to revi-
talize our economy and restore our job 
market. 
Mr. Speaker, attacking private enter-
prise won’t create a single job here or 
elsewhere. In fact, the danger of isola-
tionist, mercantilist rhetoric is that it 
can spawn bad policy that further sti-
fles innovation and economic growth. 
If we want to have a constructive de-
bate that leads to policies that will en-
courage growth and job creation, we 
need to look at the facts, and the facts 
are very simple. Engaging globally 
through exports, imports, outsourcing, 
in-sourcing, and all the many ways of 
tapping into the dynamic, competitive 
worldwide marketplace is the best way 
to get Americans back to work. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues 
not to succumb to the politically expe-
dient but economically damaging rhet-
oric of isolationism.

AFTER RECESS 
The recess having expired, the House 
was called to order by the Speaker at 
noon.

PRAYER 
Reverend Greg Lafferty, Willowdale 
Chapel, Kennett Square, Pennsylvania, 
offered the following prayer: 
Lord God, we bless You this day for 
You are good. You make Your Sun rise 
on the evil and the good; You let Your 
rain fall on the just and the unjust. 
You give all people everywhere life 
and breath and everything. Yet we rec-
ognize that in this great Nation, we are 
among the most blessed. 
You’ve granted us freedom and abun-
dance, safety and security, the rule of 
law, and neighborly love. 
Guide us, Lord, that we may steward 
these good gifts for the benefit of all. 
And today, Lord, grant this House of 
Representatives the wisdom, humility, 
and diligence to govern well, that in 
some measure good might overcome 
evil, beauty might outshine ugliness, 
and love might undo hate. And in this, 
Lord, may You be honored and may our 
Nation dwell in deeper peace and safe-
ty. 
Amen.

THE JOURNAL 
The SPEAKER. The Chair has exam-
ined the Journal of the last day’s pro-
ceedings and announces to the House 
his approval thereof.

nal stands approved.

PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The SPEAKER. Will the gentle-
woman from New York (Mrs. MALONEY) 
come forward and lead the House in the 
Pledge of Allegiance. 
Mrs. MALONEY led the Pledge of Al-
legiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

The Army brought charges against 12 
instructors for sexual assault on fe-
male trainees under their command. 
Nearly 50 women made sexual abuse 
charges, including 26 rape accusations. 
One instructor was cleared. The re-
maining 11 were either convicted at 
court martial or punished administra-
tively. 
In an interview about the scandal, 
then-Assistant Secretary of Defense 
Kenneth Bacon said: 
The issue here is the relationship between 
a trainer and a trainee. The Army regula-
tions bar intimate relationships between 
trainers and trainees, between drill ser-
geants 
and 
trainees, 
because 
they 
are 
fraught with misuse of power, with misuse of 
influence, or the possibilities of misuse of 
power and influence. 
This may be hard for some in the ci-
vilian world to relate to, but it is the 
constant reality within our Armed 
Forces. It is ingrained in our military 
servicemen and -women to follow the 
orders of their chain of command and 
never disobey. 
Here is an except from a 1996 inter-
view with an Army recruit who was 
raped by her instructor at Aberdeen. 
The victim, a South Carolina native 
who joined the Army in December of 
1995 as a way to pay for college, said 
her instructor once ordered her to the 
bathroom. ‘‘A few minutes later he 
came in behind me, and that’s when he 
started to tell me to do certain 
things,’’ she said. ‘‘To disrobe?’’ Asked 
the reporter. ‘‘Mm-hmm,’’ she said. She 
said she never screamed, never said 
‘‘no,’’ only that she was traumatized. 
‘‘When you had sex in the bathroom, 
was it something you wanted,’’ the re-
porter asked. ‘‘No,’’ Bleckley said. 
Nothing has changed. 
Last month in Texas, two victims 
were asked if they resisted when their 
Air Force training instructor lured 
them into a dark supply room to have 
sex. ‘‘No,’’ they said. They froze. 
What is happening at Lackland Air 
Force Base is no different than what 
happened at Aberdeen Proving Ground 
15 years ago. After that scandal, we 
heard assurances about how seriously 
the crimes were taken and how ‘‘we’re 
going to get to the bottom of this prob-
lem.’’ Yet clearly the military is un-
able to police itself on matters of rape 
and sexual assault. 
STOP MILITARY RAPE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. SPEIER) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
implore this body to finally take mean-
ingful action to end the epidemic of 
rape and sexual assault in the military. 
For 25 years, Congress has held dra-
matic hearings on this issue. It has 
rocked the military branches. Com-
mittee members have beat their chests 
and demanded answers from decorated 
generals and military leaders who tes-
tified. 
Congress 
demanded 
reports. 
These reports were provided and are 
now gathering dust on shelves around 
Washington, D.C. 
The time for reports is over. Now it’s 
time for action to solve this problem. 
The solution is to take the reporting 
and investigation of cases of rape and 
sexual assault out of the military 
chain of command and place them in a 
separate office independent of the 
chain of command with the authority 
to investigate and prosecute within the 
military. 
Last week I called for the House 
Armed Services Committee to hold a 
hearing on the widespread sex scandal 
at Lackland Air Force Base in San An-
tonio, Texas. No hearing date has been 
set. 
The charges of rape, assault, and sod-
omy leveled against six instructors at 
Lackland are astonishing. One instruc-
tor is accused of raping or assaulting 10 
victims, and another confessed to hav-
ing sexual relationships with another 
10 victims of his own. Yesterday we 
learned that 12 instructors are under 
investigation for sexual misconduct 
with trainees and that a criminal in-
vestigation is ongoing on four different 
Air Force bases now. 
Like many cases of rape and sexual 
assault, the perpetrators are not deny-
ing that they engaged in sexual mis-
conduct; they simply contend that the 
sex was consensual. It comes down to

In conclusion, God bless our troops, 
and we will never forget September the 
11th in the global war on terrorism. 
f 
Ms. CHU. If you want proof that Con-
gress is dysfunctional, that it is put-
ting partisanship ahead of all else, look 
no further than today’s vote to hold 
Attorney General Holder in contempt. 
In office, Holder has tirelessly pur-
sued justice for all communities. He 
has helped prevent mortgage fraud, 
fought gang violence, protected intel-
lectual property rights, and worked to 
ensure every American has the right to 
vote. We should let the Attorney Gen-
eral enforce our Nation’s laws, not 
make his job harder. 
The contempt vote against Holder is 
unprecedented, unjustified, and un-
founded. Never in the 223-year history 
of the House have we held an Attorney 
General in contempt. Yet, today, we 
will do just that in this ridiculous par-
tisan stunt. 
Congress should be creating jobs, not 
wasting taxpayer money putting on a 
political sideshow during an election 
year.

WELCOMING REVEREND GREG 
LAFFERTY 
The SPEAKER. Without objection, 
the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. 
PITTS) is recognized for 1 minute. 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PITTS. Mr. Speaker, it is an 
honor today to have Greg Lafferty, 
senior pastor of my home church, 
Willowdale Chapel, open us in prayer 
today. 
Greg studied at Wheaton College and 
Golden Gate Baptist Theological Semi-
nary. He was ordained at Saddleback 
Church in Mission Viejo, California, 
where he served as a teaching pastor 
under Rick Warren. 
Under Greg, the church has grown 
dramatically. In his time as our pastor, 
he has made our church much more ac-
tive in our community and engaged 
around the world. One example is the 
work with Hope International, touch-
ing lives in the Congo through micro-
enterprise development. The efforts of 
the church have been multiplied and 
improved in many ways under Greg’s 
leadership. He has helped our church 
show the love of Christ in our commu-
nity in new ways and around the world. 
Greg has been married to his wife, 
Deane, for 28 years. She joins us in the 
balcony. They have three children to-
gether: Kelsey, Krista, and Ryan. 
It is a great honor to have Greg and 
Deane and have Greg open our Cham-
ber today with the opening prayer.

HONOR THE CATHOLIC SISTERS 
(Mr. HIGGINS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. HIGGINS. Mr. Speaker, I re-
cently added my name to a resolution 
introduced by Representative ROSA 
DELAURO to honor the Catholic sisters 
for their contributions to this country 
and to my community. 
I grew up in the shadows of the 
Mercy Convent of south Buffalo, New 
York. The sisters came to Buffalo in 
1858, started hospitals to heal the sick, 
schools to teach the ignorant, and to 
help all of us see the gifts of God’s 
presence in a changing world. 
The sisters take a vow of poverty and 
obedience to serve God and God’s peo-
ple, particularly women and children. 
The Vatican says that the sisters are 
failing to uphold the Catholic doctrine 
and appointed three bishops to rein 
them in. The sisters reject the Vati-
can’s assessment of their life work and 
vow to fight. 
In scripture, Jesus says: ‘‘Whatever 
you do to the least of my brothers and 
sisters, you do for me.’’ The sisters are 
doing God’s work with courage, convic-
tion, and selflessness. 
May God’s guiding wisdom continue 
to inspire their good works.

CONGRATULATING EDNA YODER 
ON HER 101ST BIRTHDAY 
(Mr. YODER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. YODER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to take a special moment to rec-
ognize the birthday of a very special 
American. 
Today 
marks 
the 
101st 
birthday of my grandmother, Edna 
Yoder. 
Born in 1911, my grandmother was 
raised on a Kansas farm with her many 
brothers and sisters. Work was hard, 
and she did her part to raise livestock, 
grow wheat, and help feed America. 
I take great pride in my grandmother 
and those in her generation. Hard 
work, determination, a focus on fam-
ily, and deep religious conviction were 
the values that she and others upheld 
as they worked to build the most pros-
perous Nation the world has ever seen. 
Today on her birthday, my grand-
mother is a vibrant and healthy 101- 
year-old. She has an infectious laugh, a 
cheery disposition, and is kind to ev-
eryone she meets. Her love of quilting, 
the ‘‘Lawrence Welk Show,’’ and, of 
course, board games and bingo keep her 
time occupied and keep her young at 
heart. 
Grandma, you are an inspiration, and 
we are proud today to congratulate you 
on the celebration of your 101st birth-
day.

WALTER ZABEL 
(Mr. ISSA asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, today many 
will address the House here and later in 
the day on subjects of great current 
importance, certainly the upholding of 
the President’s health care initiative 
and, certainly, in fact, the contempt 
vote we’re going to hear in a few min-
utes. 
But this moment belongs to the peo-
ple of San Diego. Walter Zabel died 
this week at 97. Normally, when some-
one dies at 97, they have long since re-
tired. He, on the other hand, was still 
the inspiration for Cubic Corporation, 
a company he founded that did so much 
for our national defense over his 50- 
plus years at its helm. We cannot for-
get he was in the office less than a 
week ago. He was still providing stew-
ardship, still receiving the technical 
benefits of his engineers, and still mak-
ing sure that America was safe.

Day. It is not a day for the other dis-
cussions of the House.

JOBS WILL BE DESTROYED 
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, today’s decision by the Su-
preme 
Court 
is 
extremely 
dis-
appointing, undermining limited gov-
ernment and expanded freedom. The 
decision reveals ObamaCare as a huge 
tax increase on middle class taxpayers, 
destroying jobs. We should have health 
care based on doctor-patient relation-
ships rather than politician-patient re-
lationships. 
I agree with the National Federation 
of Independent Business that 1.6 mil-
lion jobs are now at risk and small 
businesses cannot make plans for the 
future, 
which 
destroys 
more 
jobs. 
House Republicans will continue to 
work to repeal the government health 
care takeover law. We will remain fo-
cused on enacting commonsense legis-
lation that will preserve the doctor-pa-
tient relationship, provide every Amer-
ican the access they need to health 
care, and promote jobs in the private 
sector.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4162 
June 28, 2012 
Let’s get on with the unfinished busi-
ness of helping create more jobs and 
putting a Nation of healthy Americans 
back to work. 
f 
Committee that actually drafted this 
bill. I read it many times, and I actu-
ally had a lot of amendments. 
The Affordable Care Act has already 
benefited millions of Americans and 
will continue to help those who are in 
the greatest of need—children, young 
adults, people with preexisting condi-
tions, and our seniors. In my own con-
gressional district in Texas, this is par-
ticularly important because we have 
one of the highest rates of uninsured 
individuals in the country. 
Our Constitution gives the U.S. Su-
preme Court the job to be the decider 
on what is constitutional. The Afford-
able Care Act is constitutional. Just 
like Social Security and Medicare, now 
it’s the law of this great Nation. 
f 
my district that was done by NAFTA a 
decade ago. I mentioned a woman I had 
met at the Buffalo Airport who, after 
23 years working in a textile factory, 
was now selling energy drinks because 
her jobs had been shipped south and 
then overseas. 
That’s why I am fighting for policies 
that support making it in America. 
And that is why I am so proud that a 
company—Kittinger Furniture, a com-
pany that makes furniture that’s found 
today in the White House—is being rec-
ognized by the 2012 Best: Made in 
America Award in recognition to their 
strong commitment to American man-
ufacturing. 
This Congress must work together to 
level the playing field for domestic 
businesses like Kittinger Furniture 
against unfair competition, particu-
larly from China. The American Gov-
ernment 
and 
American 
consumers 
must commit to buying American so 
we can have more success stories like 
Kittinger’s. 
f 
A TRIBUTE TO DR. WENDY WAYNE 
(Mr. COSTA asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to pay tribute to the life of Dr. Wendy 
Wayne, who passed away on June 17, 
2012, at the age of 64 after fighting a 
courageous 4-year battle with non- 
Hodgkin’s lymphoma. 
Wendy was a loving wife and mother, 
a committed activist and respected 
community leader who touched the 
lives of many. Wendy led a courageous 
and energetic life filled with love and 
adventure. She joined the Peace Corps 
at an early age and served in Kenya. As 
a seasoned traveler, Wendy swam the 
Earth’s five oceans. 
Her work as an educator, a nurse, and 
a community leader demonstrated her 
dedication to fostering and preserving 
and improving the health and safety of 
children throughout the world. And her 
compassion and concern for the com-
munity also served as a testament to 
her extraordinary character. 
Wendy Wayne’s unwavering loyalty 
to Kern County and her commitment 
to the well-being of future generations 
will ensure that her legacy will live on. 
She stands as a role model for her fam-
ily, her friends, and all that knew and 
worked with her. 
And we will all miss her. I will miss 
my dear friend Wendy Wayne. 
f 
TODAY IS A GREAT DAY 
(Mr. COHEN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, today is a 
great day. It’s a great day for children 
who want to stay on their parents’ 
health insurance until they’re 26—or 
parents who want their children on 
their health insurance until they’re 26. 
It’s a great day for seniors that are 
concerned about the doughnut hole, for 
women who have been discriminated 
against in health care, for all people 
who don’t want to have copays for pre-
ventative care. It’s a great day for peo-
ple who don’t want lifetime caps on 
their insurance or to be denied because 
of preexisting conditions. And it’s a 
great day for America because the rule 
of law has been upheld. 
Justice Roberts rightfully ruled that 
this was appropriate and constitu-
tional. Let us not forget Justices Gins-
burg and Sotomayor and Kagan and 
Breyer, the five Justices who upheld 
the Supreme Court belief that the 
American people have that it is a rule 
of law and that the Court is not polit-
ical. 
It was a great day for American 
health care and for American law and 
jurisprudence.

(Mr. POE of Texas asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, Sec-
retary Clinton is giving away $2 billion 
of taxpayer money for green energy de-
velopment in third-world countries. 
This isn’t money for vaccines. This 
isn’t money for clean water. This isn’t 
money to help child hunger. This is 
money for green energy. 
Don’t we need to make sure that peo-
ple have electricity before we worry 
about what kind of light bulb they are 
using? People are starving, being ran-
sacked by terrorists, taken away as 
child soldiers, and dying of preventible 
diseases like diarrhea. So our govern-
ment decided the best use of taxpayer 
money was to put billions in those 
countries for green energy. 
Our government wasted millions of 
taxpayer dollars on phony loans for 
green energy right here in the United 
States to companies like Solyndra. 
Congress didn’t even approve this $2 
billion giveaway. 
With all the problems of debt in the 
United States and disease in other 
countries, 
government 
is 
providing 
subsidies for green energy. Who would 
have thought? The government is out 
of 
control. 
More 
taxpayer 
money 
thrown into the windmill of willful 
waste. 
And that’s just the way it is.

IN OPPOSITION TO THE ATTORNEY 
GENERAL CONTEMPT VOTE 
(Ms. FUDGE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. FUDGE. Mr. Chairman, today I 
rise to speak in opposition to the 
House resolution to hold Attorney Gen-
eral Eric Holder in contempt of Con-
gress. 
With total disregard of the fact that 
the Attorney General and the Depart-
ment of Justice have cooperated with 
each inquiry from the House Oversight 
and Government Reform Committee 
during the last 15 months, Chairman 
ISSA decided to pursue this extreme 
and unprecedented action. 
To take action on this resolution is a 
gross misuse of this Chamber’s time 
and energy, given that the information 
requested by Chairman ISSA will shed 
no light on the person or persons re-
sponsible for the death of Agent Brian 
Terry, and that is where our time and 
energy should be focused. 
Instead of wasting the time of the 
committee, the Department of Justice, 
and the American people with political 
distractions, the House should be ad-
dressing the issues important to the 
welfare of this country and its people, 
and that is jobs. 
THE SUPREME COURT RULING 
(Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise 
and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. 
Speaker, I want to say that I’m proud 
of the decision of the United States Su-
preme Court today. I was proud to 
serve on the Energy and Commerce 
TODAY’S VICTORY 
(Mrs. MALONEY asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mrs. MALONEY. Mr. Speaker, today 
is not a victory for one party or an-
other. It is not a victory for an ide-
ology. It is a victory for the American 
people and for the millions who had, 
for years, gone without access to qual-
ity health care. It is a victory for 
women who will no longer be discrimi-
nated against in their insurance pre-
miums and for preexisting conditions 
and for women and children and seniors 
and families. 
This is a great day for our country, 
as we finally join the community of 
economically advanced nations that 
see to it that all their citizens have ac-
cess to quality care.

WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THE 
TRUTH? 
(Mr. GOWDY asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. GOWDY. Mr. Speaker, my ques-
tion is simply this: What percentage of 
the truth do you want? When we’re 
asked to negotiate; when the Attorney 
General comes and asks us for an ex-
traordinary accommodation, whatever 
that means; when we’re asked to com-
promise; my question for our col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle, 
Mr. Speaker, is this: What percentage 
of the truth will you settle for? If you 
have ever sat on the other side of the 
table from parents who have lost a 
loved one, is 50 percent enough? Is that 
enough of the documents? Seventy-five 
percent? A third? 
The truth, the whole truth, so help 
me God—that is what we ask witnesses 
to do, jurors to do, and that’s not too 
much for us to ask for the Attorney 
General of the United States of Amer-
ica to do.

AFFORDABLE CARE ACT DECISION 
(Mr. BUTTERFIELD asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, as 
a former judge of the North Carolina 
State Supreme Court, I’ve come to the 
well today to applaud the United 
States Supreme Court for its courage 
and for ruling on the side of constitu-
tionality of the Affordable Care Act. 
This is a win, Mr. Speaker, for 48 mil-
lion Americans, Democrats and Repub-
licans alike, who will receive stable, 
secure, and affordable health coverage 
forever. 
I believe that much of the public con-
fusion surrounding the bill was because 
Americans outside of the Washington 
Beltway simply did not understand 
what the Affordable Care Act means 
for them. So to put it plainly, Ameri-
cans can now enjoy coverage without 
worry or jeopardy, regardless of pre-
existing conditions. Uninsured young 
people up to age 26 will be able to re-
ceive coverage. If you become gravely 
ill, there are no limits on your bene-
fits. If you are a woman, you can’t be 
charged higher premiums. If you need 
preventive care, you won’t have a 
copay or deductible. If you lose your 
job, you won’t lose your coverage. And 
if your employer doesn’t provide cov-
erage, you will be able to buy it at af-
fordable prices. 
The political theater Republicans or-
chestrated around health care is over. 
Congress debated, the Court decided. 
This is done. 
f 
THERE HAS NOT BEEN FULL 
COMPLIANCE 
(Mr. CHAFFETZ asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, despite 
what has been said here, it is the duty 
and obligation of this body to address a 
duly issued subpoena that has not been 
complied with. There has not been full 
compliance here. There has not been 
cooperation here. There has not been a 
willingness to share the information 
that is found within the Department of 
Justice. 
We have a dead Border Patrol agent. 
We have more than 200 weapons that 
were used to kill people in Mexico. We 
have thousands of missing weapons. We 
have an Attorney General who said 
that this Fast and Furious program 
was fundamentally flawed. And yet 
here we stand today after doing more 
than just bending over backwards for 
more than a year, not having been 
given the documents that we need, as a 
body, to make a proper decision. 
This should be bipartisan in our 
quest to right a wrong. It’s not about 
Eric Holder, but it is about the Depart-
ment of Justice and it is about justice 
in the United States of America. I am 
proud of the fact that we are bringing 
up this contempt. 
It’s sad that we got to this day. We 
have no other choice. But we, as a 
body, as an institution, as a separate 
branch of government, have a duty and 
an obligation, and we are fulfilling that 
here today. 
f 
WE DESERVE TO KNOW WHAT 
HAPPENED 
(Mrs. ADAMS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mrs. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today not only as a congressional 
Member but also a widow of a law en-
forcement officer who lost his life in 
the line of duty. I rise to speak on be-
half of all those families that have lost 
a loved one in the line of duty, and es-
pecially for Brian Terry and his family. 
The Terry family deserves to know 
what happened. The American people 
deserve to know what happened. And 
Congress deserves to know what hap-
pened. But let us not forget, Officer 
Terry’s family deserves to know what 
happened. 
I stand here on behalf of all of those 
families who have lost law enforcement 
officers throughout our great Nation in 
the line of duty. We must not waiver. 
We, as a Congress, need to find out 
what happened so it never happens 
again. And that’s something that we 
never should lose sight of. We need to 
make sure that whatever took place, it 
doesn’t happen again. We should not be 
losing our officers this way.

HEALTH CARE VICTORY 
(Mr. PALLONE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
WHAT CHANGES HAVE REALLY 
OCCURRED? 
(Ms. RICHARDSON asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. RICHARDSON. Mr. Chairman, I 
come here today because when I was 6 
years old, in 1968, I saw the hate-filled 
work of the civil rights movement, of 
laws that needed to be changed. And 
now I’m here with an opportunity to be 
here in Congress, and I kind of wonder 
what changes have really occurred. 
I see today that Chief Justice Rob-
erts stood, and he did the right thing 
because he ruled on behalf of the Amer-
ican people. And I will say that this 
motion that’s going to come forward 
will not have bipartisan support of this 
Member because it’s not done in a bi-
partisan manner. It’s done in a hateful 
manner. 
And why? 
Because we have an Attorney Gen-
eral where this has never been done— 
we need to stress that again—never 
been done in this Congress, where ma-
terials have been provided, and where 
this committee has failed to accept a 
single witness requested by the other 
side. That’s not bipartisanship. That’s 
politics at its worst. 
I urge the American people to look 
and to urge us to get back to work and 
HEALTH CARE 
(Mr. LARSEN of Washington asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise 
and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to declare that 
the Supreme Court ruling on the Af-
fordable Care Act affirms there’s no 
going back to the health care of 2009 or 
even to the health care of 1789. Im-
provements to health care are taking 
root right now in this country. That 
progress must continue. The Supreme 
Court decision today is a welcome vic-
tory for middle class families and bol-
sters the necessary changes taking 
place in health care today. 
Now we must keep Medicare sustain-
able and affordable by closing the pre-
scription 
drug 
doughnut 
hole 
and 
cracking down on fraud. Now we must 
make sure middle class families have 
diverse options for high-quality, afford-
able health care. Now we must ensure 
that we meet the needs of northwest 
Washington State seniors, veterans, 
and families. Northwest Washington 
has already seen improvement. Seniors 
in the Second District who were in the 
doughnut hole have saved more than 
$800 on prescription medications so far 
this year. More than 173,000 people in 
northwest 
Washington 
State 
have 
health insurance that covers preven-
tive 
care 
without 
copays 
or 
deductibles. 
It is time to move forward on health 
care. And today, America took a great 
step.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4164 
June 28, 2012 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, today is 
a great day for the American people. 
The Supreme Court’s decision to up-
hold the Affordable Care Act reaffirms 
our Nation’s commitment to make sure 
that all Americans have access to qual-
ity, affordable health care and health 
insurance. For the millions of Ameri-
cans who have gone without health in-
surance; the seniors who have strug-
gled due to inadequate coverage; the 
women, children, and young adults 
that have been denied coverage for pre-
existing conditions, the Court’s ruling 
is not only a victory but a validation 
that they deserve to have the most 
basic of human needs met—and that is 
access to health care. 
The ACA addressed so many gaps in 
the American health care system, from 
closing the Medicare part D doughnut 
hole to stopping the practice of deny-
ing those with preexisting conditions 
insurance coverage to claiming wom-
anhood as a preexisting health condi-
tion to allowing young adults to stay 
on their parents’ coverage. 
This law has changed the way our 
country 
manages 
and 
delivers 
all 
phases of our health care system, and 
I’m proud to have been part of its cre-
ation, and prouder still today to learn 
that the Court’s decision was to uphold 
its constitutionality.

tleman from Florida is recognized for 1 
hour.

Mr. NUGENT. Mr. Speaker, for the 
purpose of debate only, I yield the cus-
tomary 30 minutes to the gentleman 
from Massachusetts, my colleague on 
the Rules Committee, Mr. MCGOVERN, 
pending which I yield myself such time 
as I may consume. During consider-
ation of this resolution, all time yield-
ed is for the purpose of debate only. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. NUGENT. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks. 
HEALTH CARE WIN-WIN 
(Mr. FARR asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. FARR. I rise today because I 
think everybody in this country is al-
ways worried about health care and 
whether they’re going to be able to 
have access to it, whether they can af-
ford insurance, whether the complica-
tions of that insurance will knock 
them off health care by putting caps on 
it or saying you have a preexisting con-
dition. But those worries are over. 
America has health safety now. Every-
body in this country will be able to 
have access to health care. The Su-
preme Court made the decision that no 
one without health care cannot be 
treated. 
So I think it’s a really happy day. 
There’s going to be a lot of discussions 
here about pros and cons on how it’s all 
worked out, but each individual, I 
think, will be able to decide: I can go 
to a doctor and I can get the kind of 
care that I need, and it’s going to get 
paid for so doctors and hospitals will 
make it. That’s the bottom line. 
I left my office this morning, and one 
of my interns is 25 years old, and she 
says, I’ve got health care insurance be-
cause of the law you passed. Until I’m 
26, I can stay on my parents’ health 
care insurance, and I otherwise would 
have none. Because she’s already grad-
uated from college. 
So this is a win-win for everyone. It’s 
a great day for America. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Florida? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. NUGENT. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of this rule and the 
underlying resolution it brings to the 
House floor. 
The rule provides for consideration of 
two contempt of Congress charges laid 
against Attorney General Eric Holder. 
You’re going to hear a lot of folks say 
how historic today is. That ‘‘historic- 
ness’’ is why the rule provides for de-
bate and separate votes on both con-
tempt charges. The rule also provides 
for a motion to refer the criminal con-
tempt charges, if offered by Mr. DIN-
GELL, as well as motions to recommit 
both resolutions. 
I don’t assume to put words in his 
mouth, but I’m sure and I’m willing to 
bet that Mr. MCGOVERN is sitting over 
there getting ready to tell me it’s not 
enough time. I’m not going to disagree. 
But as we all know, before we leave 
Friday evening to go to work in our 
districts, we have a lot to get done 
here. We need to reauthorize our Na-
tion’s highway and infrastructure sys-
tems. We need to save college students 
and recent graduates from student loan 
interest rates that are 2 days away 
from doubling. We need to move for-
ward with the open amendment process 
and finish considering the appropria-
tions bill to fund our transportation 
and housing programs. It’s a lot to get 
done in 2 days. And, frankly, if we 
didn’t put a time limit on today’s con-
tempt debate, we could spend days on 
end talking about nothing but this one 
issue. 
But beyond all of that—beyond floor 
schedules and expiring authorizations, 
we’re left with this truth: Border Pa-
trol Agent Brian Terry was shot on De-
cember 14, 2010, and died of those inju-
ries the next day. His family has been 
looking for answers about what led up 
to and caused his death for over a year 
and a half. If we can do anything to an-
swer those questions, then we cannot 
and should not do anything to make 
them wait any longer—not another 
month, not another day, not another 
hour. Today, the House of Representa-
tives is going to do what we can to get 
those answers for the Terry family. 
Thanks to whistleblowers at the Bu-
reau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and 
Explosives, Members of Congress were 
alerted to the fact that Agent Terry 
was killed by guns—AK–47 assault ri-
fles, specifically—that our government 
allowed to walk into Mexico. When 
confronted with these claims, the Jus-
tice Department denied the whistle-
blowers’ claims. What we now know all 
too well is just how right the whistle-
blowers were. However, it took the De-
partment of Justice 10 months after 
their first denial, almost a year after 
Border Patrol Agent Terry’s death, to 
formally retract their denial about the 
reckless program that contributed to 
the deaths of Agent Terry and hun-
dreds of Mexican citizens.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4165 
June 28, 2012 
I’ve heard some people say this is all 
about politics. In my heart, it’s just 
the opposite. It couldn’t be further 
from 
the 
truth. 
These 
contempt 
charges aren’t about politics. They 
aren’t about Attorney General Holder, 
President Obama, or anything else but 
this: a man died serving his country, 
and we have a right to know what the 
Federal Government’s hand was in 
that. 
It’s 
clear 
this 
country 
somehow 
played a role in his death. We need to 
root it out, find the cause, and make 
sure this never, ever happens again. 
These votes today aren’t about poli-
tics; they are about answers that, at 
the very least, this country owes Agent 
Terry and his family. 
President Obama promised his would 
be the most open administration in his-
tory. When discussing executive privi-
lege in the past, Attorney General 
Holder has made it clear that the DOJ 
won’t invoke the State secrets privi-
lege to conceal ‘‘violations of the law’’ 
or ‘‘administrative error,’’ avoid ‘‘em-
barrassment,’’ or to ‘‘prevent or delay 
the release of information.’’ 
Unfortunately, that is exactly what 
has happened so far with Fast and Fu-
rious. It is for this reason why the 
House today sees no other choice other 
than to charge Attorney General Eric 
Holder with both civil and criminal 
contempt of Congress charges. 
I’m going to support both of these 
resolutions, Mr. Speaker, not because 
it’s the political thing to do, not be-
cause it’s the easy thing to do, but be-
cause it’s the right thing to do. 
And with that, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I want 
to thank my friend, the gentleman 
from Florida (Mr. NUGENT), for yielding 
me the customary 30 minutes, and I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
(Mr. MCGOVERN asked and was 
given permission to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, this is 
a sad and deeply troubling day for this 
House of Representatives. The Repub-
lican leadership of this body is asking 
us to take the unprecedented and un-
justified step of holding a sitting At-
torney General in contempt of Con-
gress. 
the highway bill and the student loan 
bill and everything else. Is it possible 
that the Republican leadership doesn’t 
really want the American people seeing 
what the House is doing today? Why 
else would they feel the need to rush 
this to the floor a mere week after the 
House 
Oversight 
Committee 
voted 
along strictly partisan lines to adopt 
the Republican contempt citation? 
Let me say at the outset that there 
are certain things that all of us, Demo-
crats and Republicans alike, agree on. 
We all agree that the death of Agent 
Terry was a terrible tragedy. We all 
agree that the ATF field office’s em-
brace 
of 
gunwalking—which 
began 
under the Bush administration, by the 
way—was a terrible idea. We all agree 
that the ATF should not have sent an 
erroneous letter to Senator GRASSLEY 
in 2011. But the contempt resolution 
before us doesn’t have anything to do 
with any of that. 
The Department of Justice has pro-
vided thousands and thousands of docu-
ments about gunwalking. The Attorney 
General has testified nine times. The 
Department has provided over 1,000 
pages of documents about the letter 
sent to Senator GRASSLEY. So this isn’t 
about getting to the truth; this is 
about politics. It is about politics. This 
is about the Republicans refusing to 
take ‘‘yes’’ for an answer. This is about 
doing whatever it takes to attack the 
Obama administration no matter the 
issue, no matter the cost. 
During the committee’s ‘‘investiga-
tion,’’ the Republican majority refused 
all Democratic requests for witnesses 
and hearings, as well as requests to 
interview any Bush administration ap-
pointees. All of them were denied. 
The Republicans refused Democratic 
requests to hold a hearing with Ken 
Melson, the head of ATF. You know, if 
you’re actually interested in learning 
about an ATF operation, don’t you 
think you would want to talk to the 
leadership of the ATF? 
Republicans refused Democratic re-
quests to hold a hearing with former 
Attorney General Mukasey, who was 
briefed on botched ATF operations in 
2007. If you’re actually interested in 
learning about these botched oper-
ations, wouldn’t you want to talk to 
the man who was briefed about them? 
I would hope that we would all agree 
that we should never take a step like 
finding a sitting Attorney General in 
contempt lightly, and that we should 
only do so based on accurate informa-
tion. But Ranking Member CUMMINGS 
and his staff have found, in a very 
short time, 100 concerns, omissions, 
and inaccuracies in the committee re-
port that is the foundation of this con-
tempt resolution—100 inaccuracies and 
omissions and concerns. Sadly, instead 
of getting answers to those questions, 
this has been rushed to the floor. 
Mr. Speaker, the American people ex-
pect us to address the issues that mat-
ter most to them—issues like jobs and 
the economy and education and health 
care—but the Republican majority re-
fuses to listen. Instead, they bring this 
b 1240 
They are doing so based on a com-
pletely partisan ‘‘investigation.’’ 
This is a witch hunt, pure and sim-
ple, Mr. Speaker, and it has no place in 
this House. Eric Holder is a good and 
decent and honorable public servant. 
He has reinvigorated the Justice De-
partment, especially on efforts to stop 
partisan voter suppression across the 
country. 
I find it interesting that the Repub-
lican leadership has scheduled this 
nonsense for the floor today when it is 
certain to be buried under the ava-
lanche of news and reaction to the Su-
preme Court’s health care decision and 
You know, I was a cop for almost 40 
years and a sheriff for the last 10. As 
the head of a law enforcement agency, 
you have two options when you make a 
mistake: you can hope it doesn’t come 
out, and if it does, you go into 
lockdown and deny, deny, deny; or you 
can get out in front of it, admit you 
made a mistake, tell the American peo-
ple you’re going to investigate, and 
then do everything you can to make 
sure that this never happens again. 
As sheriff, I found it was my moral 
imperative to always admit when we’d 
been wrong, hold folks accountable, 
and make my agency better so we 
wouldn’t 
make 
the 
same 
mistake 
twice. It’s the responsible thing to do, 
and it takes away any sting of the pos-
sibility of a coverup. 
That’s not what DOJ did. They’ve 
gone the other route—hide, deny, and 
stonewall. 
They sent a letter with false informa-
tion to Congress, the institution that’s 
constitutionally mandated with gov-
ernment oversight, and it took them 10 
months to retract that statement. It 
appears that in those 10 months be-
tween lying and admitting the truth, 
members of DOJ and the ATF colluded 
to intentionally cover up what hap-
pened. What we’re trying to figure out 
is if there really was a coverup, and we 
need the information to determine the 
facts. 
Yesterday at the Rules Committee, a 
couple of people mentioned President 
Nixon and Watergate. And I agree, this 
is like the Watergate scandal. But 
President Nixon didn’t leave office be-
cause of the scandal itself; he was 
forced to resign because of the coverup. 
I said it last night and I’m willing to 
bet, Attorney General Holder didn’t 
know all the specifics about what was 
happening with Fast and Furious, but 
when the facts started coming to light 
and congressional investigators started 
looking for answers, he repeatedly kept 
us from getting information we need. 
And that has kept the Terry family 
from getting the closure they need. 
Attorney General Holder is respon-
sible for his agency, but he has essen-
tially given his top leadership a free 
pass. 
Mr. Speaker, a law enforcement offi-
cer who was employed by the United 
States Federal Government is dead. 
Somebody knows what happened to re-
sult in his death, and the Justice De-
partment and now President Obama 
are refusing to release that informa-
tion to Congress, to the American pub-
lic, and to Agent Terry’s family. 
This institution has a duty to oversee 
the executive branch and to find out 
what happened. The answers are there. 
Attorney General Holder knows the an-
swers are there because he’s the one 
who has the documents that contain 
the answers we’re looking for. He’s the 
gatekeeper here, and if he won’t give us 
the information this institution needs 
to do our duty, our constitutional 
duty, then we will use every legal and 
constitutional tool that we have to get 
to it.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4166 
June 28, 2012 
interviewed two dozen officials, and the 
Attorney General has testified on nine 
occasions. 
This is an election-year witch hunt. I 
say that to the gentleman from South 
Carolina. This is an election-year witch 
hunt. During this 16-month investiga-
tion, the committee refused all Demo-
cratic requests for witnesses and hear-
ings, as well as requests to interview 
any Bush administration appointees. 
Never in our Nation’s history has the 
House of Representatives voted to hold 
a sitting Attorney General or a Cabinet 
member in contempt. What’s different? 
I will tell you what’s different. It is 
the simple fact that Republicans have 
a dogged determination to discredit 
and defeat this President at all costs. 
Plain and simple, it’s politics. 
My Republican friends, do not use 
your majority to engage in a political 
stunt. The integrity and legacy of this 
institution deserve better than that. If 
you want to discredit and defeat this 
President, you need to leave this floor 
and leave the C–SPAN cameras, and go 
out and give it your best shot. This is 
not the place to do it. 
When the history of this despicable 
proceeding is recorded, it will be said 
that your actions were politically mo-
tivated to discredit and defeat a Presi-
dent who has worked so hard over the 
past 3 years. 
I encourage my colleagues to join me 
in refusing to vote for this gimmick 
and walk to the steps of the Capitol 
and explain the circumstances of this 
dark day. Do not vote for this resolu-
tion. 
For those of you who choose to vote, 
I ask that you defeat the rule and vote 
against these contempt resolutions. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. NUGENT. I yield the gentleman 
an additional 1 minute. 
Mr. SCOTT of South Carolina. We 
have been trying for 18 long months to 
get to the bottom of this issue, and yet 
we are being stonewalled. 
Yes, we hear that the Federal Gov-
ernment has provided 7,000-plus pages; 
but, Mr. Speaker, there are over 100,000 
pages that we have requested. We are 
talking about a period from February 
4, 2011, to December 2011, where we 
were given false information. It is our 
responsibility, it is our duty to find the 
truth for the American people and the 
Terry family. 
Let me close, Mr. Speaker, by simply 
saying, how are we supposed to protect 
and ensure the safety of our Border Pa-
trol agents in the future if we do not 
know who allowed the guns to walk 
across the border? How are we supposed 
to give Brian Terry’s family any sense 
of closure, Mr. Speaker? This is why we 
have no choice but to be here today. 
The refusal of the Attorney General to 
provide answers regarding Brian Ter-
ry’s death leaves us no choice but to be 
here today. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, let me 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume before I yield to the gentleman 
from North Carolina. 
Mr. Speaker, the last time Congress 
dealt with a contempt resolution was 
in the case of Joshua Bolton and Har-
riet Miers. The period of time between 
when the committee voted out the res-
olution and before there was floor ac-
tion was 6 months. The reason why 
there was time taken was to make sure 
that we got it right. 
This is less than a week. And I’m 
going to say to my friends on the other 
side of the aisle that the minority staff 
has compiled a list of 100 inaccura-
cies—100 inaccuracies in the report 
that was the basis for this contempt 
resolution—100—and they’re rushing it 
to the floor. So don’t tell me this is not 
about politics. Don’t tell me this is not 
a witch hunt. It is exactly what it is. 
Mr. Speaker, I’d like to yield 2 min-
utes to the gentleman from North 
Carolina (Mr. BUTTERFIELD). 
Mr. BUTTERFIELD. The gentleman 
from Massachusetts is absolutely cor-
rect, this is a sad and troubling day. 
What we see here today, Mr. Speaker, 
is nothing more than using the Halls of 
Congress for extreme partisan political 
purposes. 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to direct their re-
marks to the Chair. 
Mr. NUGENT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself as much time as I may con-
sume. 
You know, it’s amazing that my 
friends forget about history because 
they referenced history in 2008 as re-
lated to House Resolution 979 and 
House Resolution 980. And you know 
what they did? 
They passed a rule and said it’s here-
by adopted. You never even had discus-
sion on the House floor like we’re going 
to do today. Never had debate on the 
House floor. They just passed it in the 
Rules Committee and said, guess what, 
it’s hereby adopted. 
I yield such time as he may consume 
to the gentleman from California (Mr. 
ISSA), the chairman of the Committee 
on Oversight and Government Reform. 
Mr. ISSA. I place in the RECORD at 
this time the statement by the Terry 
family concerning Congressman DIN-
GELL’s criticism of the contempt vote. 
TERRY FAMILY STATEMENT WITH REGARD TO 
CONGRESSMAN JOHN DINGELL’S CRITICISM OF 
CONTEMPT VOTE 
On Wednesday, Representative John Din-
gell invoked the Terry family name while 
saying he would not back the contempt reso-
lutions but instead wants the Oversight and 
b 1250 
This case is all about a politically 
motivated confrontation with the exec-
utive branch on a matter that does not 
even begin to rise to this level. 
This case is not about gunwalking. 
Those documents have been provided 
and are not in dispute. The documents 
at issue are completely unrelated to 
how gunwalking was initiated in Oper-
ation Fast and Furious. The Depart-
ment has produced thousands of pages 
of documents. The committee has 
resolution to the floor, and then they 
wonder why Congress is so unpopular. 
What troubles me most, perhaps, is 
that under this Republican majority, 
everything has to be a fight—every-
thing. Everything has to be a con-
frontation, everything has to be a 
showdown. And I get the politics. I un-
derstand this is an election year. But 
this goes way, way too far. It is just 
wrong. 
I wish the Speaker of the House 
would have intervened here and kept 
this off the floor. By moving forward 
today on this resolution, we diminish 
the House of Representatives. This is 
not a happy day for this institution. 
I urge my colleagues to reject this 
rule and the underlying resolutions, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NUGENT. Mr. Speaker, the gen-
tleman from Massachusetts made a 
statement. This is about a contempt ci-
tation because the Attorney General 
has not provided all the information 
the committee has asked for. Out of 
140,000 pages—by his own testimony in 
front of Judiciary—he’s given a little 
over 7,000 pages. That’s not reaching 
out and doing the right thing. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. 
SCOTT), a fellow Rules Committee 
member. 
Mr. SCOTT of South Carolina. I 
thank the gentleman for the time. 
Mr. Speaker, it seems to me that my 
friends on the left need some clarifica-
tion on why we are here this afternoon. 
This is not a good day for America, and 
it is certainly still not a good day for 
the Terry family. 
My friends on the left continue to 
talk about this as if it were a witch 
hunt—a witch hunt. We have a slain 
Border Patrol agent, and my friends on 
the left want to politicize this by talk-
ing about a witch hunt when in fact we 
all know that this, Mr. Speaker, is 
about justice. This is about justice. 
My friend on the left just said that 
we Republicans refuse to hear ‘‘yes,’’ 
we refuse to accept ‘‘yes’’ as an answer. 
Well, Mr. Speaker, we want a ‘‘yes’’ for 
Kent Terry, we want a ‘‘yes’’ for Jose-
phine Terry, the parents of Brian 
Terry. We want a ‘‘yes’’ for the Amer-
ican people. We want a ‘‘yes’’ as it re-
lates to the integrity of the process, 
and we want a ‘‘yes’’ for justice. And, 
Mr. Speaker, my friends on the left 
continue to consistently say ‘‘no.’’ 
We are here, Mr. Speaker, for only 
two reasons. The first is because 
United States Border Patrol Agent 
Brian Terry is dead because of a Fed-
eral Government operation that al-
lowed American guns to be walked 
across the border in the hands of drug 
lords and cartels. We are here today, 
Mr. Speaker, because the Department 
of Justice; the Attorney General, Eric 
Holder; and now the President refuse to 
comply with congressional subpoenas 
that will give us clarity on these ques-
tions, give us clear answers for the 
Terry family and for the American peo-
ple.

fused to comply with a congressional 
subpoena that was issued in October of 
2011. 
I was a practicing attorney in the 
real world before I came to Congress. 
In the real world, Americans are ex-
pected to comply with subpoenas. Is 
the Attorney General any different? 
No, he is not. 
Are we just supposed to take Mr. 
Holder’s word that we have all the in-
formation? 
That may be how Washington works, 
Mr. Attorney General, but that is not 
how Main Street works. 
Mr. Attorney General, what are you 
hiding? What are you hiding from the 
Brian Terry family? What are you hid-
ing from the American public? 
I’ve said it before and I will say it 
again: you can delegate authority but 
you cannot delegate responsibility. 
Mr. Speaker, the Attorney General 
can stonewall all he wants. The Attor-
ney General can misremember all he 
wants. But whether he likes it or not, 
today responsibility will land on his 
desk. 
Mr. Speaker, I applaud Chairman 
ISSA for his steadfast leadership in the 
pursuit of the truth. I applaud my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle 
who are putting the search of the truth 
before party. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. NUGENT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
another 15 seconds to the gentleman 
from Florida. 
Mr. ROSS of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I 
applaud all of those, like Agent Terry, 
who wear the uniform of the Armed 
Forces or stand on the border and 
guard our Nation. Agent Terry knew a 
thing or two about duty. He died while 
on duty. 
It is now the duty of this Congress to 
hold those responsible and accountable 
for this failed operation. We will not 
forget, and we will always stand with 
you. 
Government Reform Committee to conduct a 
more thorough investigation into Operation 
Fast and Furious. 
Congressman Dingell represents the dis-
trict in Michigan where Brian Terry was 
born and where his family still resides, but 
his views don’t represent those of the Terry 
family. Nor does he speak for the Terry fam-
ily. And he has never spoken to the Terry 
family. 
His office sent us a condolence letter when 
Brian was buried 18 months ago. That’s the 
last time we heard from him. 
A year ago, after the House Oversight and 
Reform Committee began looking into Oper-
ation Fast and Furious, one of Brian’s sisters 
called Rep. Dingell’s office seeking help and 
answers. No one from his office called back. 
Mr. Dingell is now calling for more inves-
tigation to be conducted before the Attorney 
General can be held in contempt of Congress. 
The Terry family has been waiting for over 
18 months for answers about Operation Fast 
and Furious and how it was related to 
Brian’s death. If Rep. Dingell truly wants to 
support the Terry family and honor Brian 
Terry, a son of Michigan, he and other Mem-
bers of Congress will call for the Attorney 
General to immediately provide the docu-
ments requested by the House Oversight and 
Government Reform Committee. 
Mr. NUGENT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Florida 
(Mr. ROSS). 
Mr. ROSS of Florida. Mr. Speaker, 
today I rise to offer my support to hold 
the Attorney General in contempt of 
Congress. 
In December 2010, Border Patrol 
Agent Brian Terry was killed with a 
gun that was allowed to walk across 
the border as a result of Operation Fast 
and Furious. 
Mr. Speaker, some, including this At-
torney General and some of my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle, 
state that this operation began in a 
previous administration. This is de-
monstrably false, and nothing could be 
further from the truth. 
While there was a program under the 
previous administration known as Wide 
Receiver, the differences are quite 
stark. Under Wide Receiver, weapons 
were tracked, the Mexican government 
was involved, and no one died as a re-
sult of that operation. In fact, Oper-
ation Wide Receiver ended in late 2007, 
nearly 2 years before Fast and Furious 
began and nearly 9 months before this 
President was sworn into office. 
Fast and Furious allowed guns to 
walk across the Mexican border with 
no tracking, no involvement by Mexi-
can officials. Over 2,000 firearms dis-
appeared across the border under this 
failed operation. Hundreds of Mexicans 
are dead because of this failed oper-
ation. 
An American hero and United States 
Marine, Agent Brian Terry, is dead be-
cause of this failed operation. Agent 
Terry stood his ground and told moms 
and dads across America that no one 
would hurt their children on his watch. 
He stood up and took that responsi-
bility. 
To this day, no one, and I mean no 
one, in this administration has had the 
guts to stand up and say, ‘‘It was my 
fault.’’ Attorney General Holder has re-
coordinate interdictions with Mexico 
in 2007, and was informed directly that 
these efforts would be expanded during 
his tenure; refused the opportunity to 
have the Attorney General as a wit-
ness. 
Mr. Speaker, this partisanship was 
demonstrated by the committee’s vote 
along strictly partisan lines to hold the 
Attorney General in contempt and to 
vote along strictly partisan lines on 
every amendment. This is about poli-
tics. This is not about the truth. This 
is not about justice. This is about poli-
tics, and that is why this is such a sad 
day for this institution. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from Vermont (Mr. WELCH). 
Mr. WELCH. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Massachusetts. 
Mr. Speaker, the investigation that’s 
being conducted by the Committee on 
Oversight and Government Reform is a 
legitimate investigation. But the rec-
ommendation to this House to hold the 
Attorney General in contempt is reck-
less, irresponsible, unnecessary, and 
will actually get in the way of the pur-
suit of truth. 
Why do I say that? 
If you’re going to do an investiga-
tion, you have to begin at the begin-
ning, and the beginning of Fast and Fu-
rious and gunwalking began in the 
Bush administration. There’s no evi-
dence that President Bush was aware 
of it. There’s some questions about 
what his Attorney General knew, what 
and when. 
But if you are sincerely interested in 
trying to find out what happened, how 
it happened, how in the world do you 
not begin at the beginning? 
And despite that fact, the requests of 
many of us on the committee who sup-
port an investigation, who support the 
use of a subpoena, who support the ag-
gressive right of Congress to get access 
to documents that it needs, have been 
denied the opportunity to bring in wit-
nesses about what happened and how it 
happened during the Bush administra-
tion. 
We’ve been denied the opportunity to 
bring in Attorney General Mukasey, 
despite the fact that there was evi-
dence that he was personally briefed on 
the botched efforts to coordinate inter-
diction 
with 
Mexican 
authorities. 
Then-Attorney General Mukasey was 
also told that the ATF field office in 
Phoenix planned to expand these oper-
ations during his tenure. So our ques-
tion really quite simply is, begin at the 
beginning. 
That foundation of an open and ex-
haustive search is what this com-
mittee, the Committee on Government 
Reform, owes to this House of Rep-
resentatives before it asks the Mem-
bers of this House to vote on the ex-
traordinary measure of finding a sit-
ting Attorney General in contempt. 
Secondly, we’ve got to do our job 
with care. The original subpoena that 
went out and was there until the Fri-
day before the Wednesday in which we 
voted was demanding that the Attor-
ney General turn over documents that

Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
My friend from Florida (Mr. NUGENT) 
talked about obstructionism, and I 
want to say a couple of words about 
that because I think this whole process 
has obstructed justice. 
During the committee’s 16-month in-
vestigation, the committee refused all 
Democratic requests for witnesses and 
hearings, which is unprecedented. For 
instance, the committee refused to 
hold a public hearing with Ken Melson, 
the head of ATF, the agency respon-
sible for this operation, after he told 
committee investigators privately that 
he never informed senior department 
officials about gunwalking because he 
was unaware of it. 
The committee also refused a hear-
ing, or even a private meeting, with 
former Attorney General Mukasey, 
who was briefed on botched efforts to

would have been illegal for him to turn 
over—transcripts of the grand jury. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. I yield the gen-
tleman an additional 15 seconds. 
b 1300 
Mr. WELCH. So transcripts of the 
grand jury, transcripts of wiretap ap-
plications, which is not only a viola-
tion of the U.S. Code, but would jeop-
ardize law enforcement officials if that 
word got out. That is an irresponsible 
and overbroad subpoena. 
So the bottom line is to let the inves-
tigation continue, but let’s acknowl-
edge that the job that the committee 
needs to do before it asks for a vote of 
contempt has not been done. 
Mr. NUGENT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Texas, 
Judge POE. 
Mr. POE of Texas. I thank the gen-
tleman. 
Mr. Speaker, we are here today be-
cause of an ill-conceived, dangerous, il-
legal, gun-running scheme called Oper-
ation Fast and Furious. 
This operation has resulted in the 
death of at least one—maybe two—Fed-
eral agents and in the deaths of hun-
dreds of Mexican nationals; yet we still 
cannot get a straight answer from the 
Justice Department as to what hap-
pened. The Attorney General says he 
doesn’t know who authorized this non-
sense, but he won’t let Congress help 
him find out the facts. 
In December of last year, Attorney 
General Holder testified before the 
House Judiciary Committee and told 
me that Operation Fast and Furious 
was ‘‘flawed and reckless’’ and that it 
was ‘‘probably true’’ that more people 
were going to die. 
Now, isn’t that lovely? 
Why is the Attorney General being so 
obstinate? 
After 
months 
of 
delay, 
delay, delay, today is the day of reck-
oning. 
This administration claims to be the 
most transparent administration in 
history. So why won’t the administra-
tion let the American people know 
what happened during Fast and Furi-
ous? What are they hiding? 
This contempt resolution is about 
one thing. It’s about finding out how 
such a stealth and dangerous operation 
could ever be authorized by the Gov-
ernment of the United States. Why 
would our government help smuggle 
guns to our neighbor and put them in 
the hands of the enemy of Mexico and 
the United States—the violent drug 
cartels? 
And no wonder the Attorney General 
of Mexico wants those in the United 
States who are responsible to be extra-
dited to Mexico and tried for those pos-
sible crimes. Mexico is more interested 
in Fast and Furious than is our own 
government. 
As a former judge, I can tell you that 
contempt is used as a last resort to let 
individuals know they will comply 
with a lawful order whether they like 
Mr. NUGENT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to a former law enforcement 
officer who lost her husband in the line 
of duty, the gentlewoman from Florida 
(Mrs. ADAMS). 
Mrs. ADAMS. I am going to come to 
you from a different angle, one of a law 
enforcement officer. 
I served over 17 years as a law en-
forcement officer, and I worked many 
undercover operations. As a law en-
forcement officer, you knew you didn’t 
give guns to bad guys. The drug car-
tels, they’re bad guys. You know if you 
let a gun walk with a bad guy that 
you’re going to see that gun whether 
it’s at a crime scene, or you’re going to 
be looking down the barrel of it. 
So when the Attorney General came 
to our committee, I asked him, Who 
approved this operation? Why was it 
approved? And he just wouldn’t answer. 
He didn’t know. 
Okay. Well, what rises to the level of 
the Attorney General? If an inter-
national operation that allows guns to 
walk to another country and that are 
then used to kill one of our agents and 
that are used to kill and maim their 
citizens doesn’t rise to his level of ap-
proval, who approved it? 
This is something that is just normal 
procedure in any operation in a law en-
forcement agency. 
So now you have an Attorney Gen-
eral who won’t tell us or can’t tell us 
who approved this international oper-
ation. You have others saying, Well, 
this is something that started under 
another administration. 
It didn’t. That was a different oper-
ation, and they realized they couldn’t 
keep up with those guns, so they 
stopped it. When this one started, it 
was flawed from the beginning. The At-
torney General said it was flawed from 
the beginning. 
Yet we still have no answers. We 
don’t have answers. The American peo-
ple don’t have answers, and most im-
portantly, the Terry family doesn’t 
have answers. That’s just unaccept-
able. 
I’ve heard from the other side of the 
aisle and from my colleagues here 
today that this is political. This isn’t 
political. To me, it’s personal. We have 
a law enforcement officer who was 
doing his job and who was killed by a 
flawed operation that no one will take 
ownership of in the Attorney General’s 
Office; and the Attorney General, him-
self, won’t tell us what rises to the 
level of his knowing what’s going on in 
his agency if an international oper-
ation does not. 
So I will tell you that it was not po-
litical when I started looking into this 
and when we started looking into it. It 
is not political today. The way that it 
became political was when there was 
asserted, right before the gavel dropped 
in the committee, an executive privi-
lege. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The

it or not. Even the Attorney General 
cannot evade the law. 
Time for America to find out the 
truth about gun smuggling to Mexico. 
Time for a little transparency. Today 
is judgment day. 
And that’s just the way it is. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, let me 
remind my friend that this gunwalking 
program started under President Bush. 
And that’s just the way it is. 
I would like to yield 15 seconds to the 
gentleman 
from 
Texas 
(Mr. 
GENE 
GREEN). 
Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mem-
bers, I’m from Texas. We believe it’s 
our constitutional right to own every 
gun that was ever made, and we don’t 
want to export them to anywhere—but 
this resolution is pure politics. 
Mr. Speaker, today I rise in opposition to the 
resolution recommending that the House of 
Representatives find Eric H. Holder, Jr., Attor-
ney General, U.S. Department of Justice, in 
contempt of Congress for refusal to comply 
with a subpoena duly issued by the committee 
on Oversight and Government Reform. 
In 2005, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, 
Firearms, 
and 
Explosives 
(ATF) 
initiated 
Project Gunrunner that focused on stemming 
the flow of firearms into Mexico. This would 
stop guns from being obtained by drug cartels 
and criminal organizations that have killed 
thousands in Mexico in recent years. 
Part of Project Gunrunner was Operation 
Fast and Furious, which has come under scru-
tiny over the past year due to reports that the 
ATF allowed the sale of hundreds of assault 
weapons to suspected straw purchasers, who 
then allegedly transported these weapons 
through the Southwest and into Mexico. In De-
cember 2010, suspected firearms linked to 
Operation Fast and Furious were found at the 
murder scene of Border Patrol Agent Brian 
Terry. 
This resolution is not about Project Gun-
runner or Operation Fast and Furious because 
the Department of Justice has produced thou-
sands of pages of documents, two dozen offi-
cials have been interviewed, and the Attorney 
General has testified nine times, to show it 
was not responsible for these operations. The 
Attorney General has continually offered to 
provide even more information, including doc-
uments outside of the Committee’s original 
subpoena. The documents that are now at the 
center of the resolution are completely unre-
lated to how Project Gunrunner or Operation 
Fast and Furious were initiated. 
This investigation is nothing more than a 
hyper-partisan, election-year effort. The Com-
mittee vote was strictly along partisan lines 
and every amendment passed or failed on 
party-line votes. During this investigation, the 
Committee refused all Democratic requests for 
witnesses and hearings, as well as requests to 
interview any Bush Administration appointees. 
Attorney General Eric Holder has produced 
sufficient evidence, through thousands of 
pages of documents and testifying nine times 
before the committee, to confirm that once he 
learned about Operation Fast and Furious, he 
took action to bring it to a close. The denial of 
Democratic requests to interview officials of 
the Bush Administration on this matter only 
further proves this is strictly a partisan political 
game to hold the first sitting Attorney General 
in contempt.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4169 
June 28, 2012 
Mrs. ADAMS. I ask you today to ap-
prove 
this 
resolution. 
Bring 
some 
credibility back to our Department of 
Justice. If this had happened in an-
other agency throughout this Nation 
and if one of our officers had died and 
if the Department of Justice were in-
volved in the investigation, they would 
be asking for the same documents that 
we are asking for. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, let me 
just say to the gentlelady that if she is 
interested in why the United States 
pursued this gunwalking program, she 
should talk to the Attorney General 
under the Bush administration, Attor-
ney General Mukasey, when this thing 
started 5 years ago. 
Unfortunately, notwithstanding the 
fact that the Democrats have asked 
that he be called before the committee, 
the request has been denied. She wants 
to know why this is political? The re-
quest for every single witness that the 
Democrats asked to be brought before 
the committee was denied, the request 
for every single witness. 
That is unprecedented in this House 
in any committee, the fact that the 
Democrats have been locked out of 
having any of their witnesses come for-
ward. This is not about gunwalking. 
This is not about finding the terrible 
truth about what happened to Agent 
Terry. This is about politics, plain and 
simple; and it diminishes this House. 
I would like to yield 2 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from the District of Co-
lumbia (Ms. NORTON). 
Ms. NORTON. I thank the gentleman 
for yielding. 
Any doubt that today’s contempt res-
olution is political was put to rest 
when the NRA joined in to blowtorch 
vulnerable Democrats to vote for con-
tempt today. 
The gun lobby is directly responsible 
for the gap in Federal law that allowed 
the straw purchases of guns here that 
were taken to Mexico, ultimately re-
sulting in the tragic death of a border 
agent. Yet because of a political man-
date from the gun lobby, our com-
mittee spent no time on the root cause 
of this tragedy. Instead, after the ma-
jority failed to get the documents it re-
quested that were under court seal and 
documents related to ongoing inves-
tigations, it asked for internal commu-
nications that no Republican or Demo-
cratic administration has ever given 
up. 
Instead of sparing no effort to give 
law enforcement the tools it must have 
to protect our border agents, our com-
mittee has spared no effort to get to 
today’s 
contempt 
resolution 
over 
issues unrelated to the tragic killing. 
After 16 months, the committee found 
no evidence that the Attorney General 
or other top Justice Department offi-
cials knew about the ATF gunwalking. 
And the committee resolutely refused 
to hear from top ATF officials who said 
that they, in turn, had given the Jus-
tice Department no such information. 
b 1310 
It is Attorney General Holder who 
stopped the gunwalking authorized and 
The minority has submitted a re-
quest for witnesses in writing and even 
requested for a—which I guess they 
have the right to do—a day of minority 
witnesses, which they were told they 
would not be granted that day in a 
timely fashion. 
This is about politics. This, by all 
measures, is about politics. Again, the 
fact that we are doing this today, I 
think, diminishes the House of Rep-
resentatives. 
I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman 
from New Jersey (Mr. ANDREWS). 
(Mr. ANDREWS asked and was given 
permission to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. ANDREWS. Mr. Speaker, every 
Member of this Chamber wants to get 
to the bottom of the issue of the tragic 
death of Officer Terry. Every Member 
of the Chamber wants to find out how 
the ATF and Justice Department were 
run as related to that tragedy. 
So the committee that’s looking into 
this refused to hear the testimony of 
the person running the ATF. 
The committee that’s looking into 
this refused to hear the testimony of 
the Assistant Attorney General, who 
was responsible for the ATF and talked 
about this with Attorney General Hold-
er. 
The committee that is responsible for 
this received thousands of pages of doc-
uments from the Attorney General to 
try to get to the bottom of the matter. 
This procedure does violence to the 
American Constitution. Yes, we have 
three 
separate 
branches. 
Those 
branches are designed to respect each 
other’s prerogatives. Those branches 
are designed to avoid a constitutional 
confrontation and engage in one only 
when necessary. 
In the 225-year history of this insti-
tution, there has never been a vote like 
this before—never. 
Is it because the Attorney General 
didn’t turn over documents? He turned 
over thousands of pages of documents. 
Is it because the people that know 
about this issue haven’t been made 
available? To the contrary. The com-
mittee refused to hear the testimony of 
the head of the ATF and the Assistant 
Attorney General. 
This procedure diminishes the House. 
It 
vandalizes 
the 
Constitution. 
It 
should not go forward. 
Mr. NUGENT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds to the gentleman from Utah 
(Mr. CHAFFETZ). 
Mr. CHAFFETZ. The record will re-
flect that in a bipartisan way, the Act-
ing Director of the ATF, the person 
that was actually appointed by Presi-
dent Obama, was deposed by both 
Democrats and Republicans about a 
year ago for 2 days around July 4. It 
was 2 days that he was deposed. That 
record is there. It is crystal clear. 
We were also denied, by the Depart-
ment of Justice, to speak with Lanny 
Breuer and Kenneth Blanco, two of the 
key central people at the highest levels 
of the Department of Justice. To sug-
gest that we were given an opportunity 
to talk to them is patently false. 
started by the Bush administration. 
The contempt today, Mr. Speaker, is 
for the truth. 
Mr. NUGENT. Mr. Speaker, I just 
want to make it very clear that the 
House rules of article XI talk about, 
specifically, j(1) as it relates to the 
rights of the minority. But you have to 
ask for that. A majority of the minor-
ity has to ask for it. It has to be fo-
cused on the issue at hand. They were 
talking about issues as it related to, I 
guess, gun ownership, and that was not 
germane to that issue. 
With that, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from Arizona (Mr. QUAYLE). 
Mr. QUAYLE. I thank the gentleman 
for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, today’s vote is long 
overdue. For months, my colleagues 
and I have worked to uncover the truth 
about Operation Fast and Furious, 
which cost the life of Border Patrol 
Agent Brian Terry in my home State of 
Arizona. 
Congressional efforts to get to the 
bottom of this tragedy and bring ac-
countability to those responsible were 
met with derision by Attorney General 
Holder. At hearings, when we ques-
tioned Mr. Holder, he evaded. When we 
requested documents, he obfuscated. 
When I questioned Mr. Holder on June 
8, he looked me in the eye and stated 
plainly that there was nothing whatso-
ever in the wiretap applications that 
suggested 
the 
existence 
of 
a 
gunwalking program. Yet, all I had to 
do was review those same applications 
to see that what the attorney general 
had said to me, my colleagues, and to 
the American people, was nothing but 
a boldfaced lie. Mr. Speaker, I will re-
peat that again. It was a boldfaced lie. 
Today, let Congress’ vote be a signal 
to Mr. Holder that dishonesty on the 
part of administration officials will 
never be tolerated. 
Today, let this vote be a signal to 
President Obama that the security of 
the American people must always come 
before his own job security and the job 
security of his Cabinet officials. 
Let this vote be a reminder to Mr. 
Holder and to President Obama that 
despite 
their 
executive 
overreach, 
there 
are, 
in 
fact, 
three 
coequal 
branches of government. 
Let this vote demonstrate that Con-
gress has not forgotten its right or its 
responsibility to provide oversight and 
to bring accountability. 
I urge my colleagues to support the 
rule and the underlying resolution. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, my 
colleague from Florida (Mr. NUGENT) 
mentioned the issue of gun ownership 
as related to the witnesses that the 
Democrats wanted to have appear be-
fore the committee. How inviting the 
head of the ATF, which is responsible 
for Operation Fast and Furious, or in-
viting the former Attorney General, 
who was briefed on gunwalking and 
knew about it, how that has anything 
to do with gun ownership—what that 
has to do with, Mr. Speaker, is getting 
to the truth.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4170 
June 28, 2012 
vote. Mr. DINGELL, as Chair of the Energy and 
Commerce Committee held two hearings be-
fore proceeding to a contempt vote, after he 
received President Reagan’s assertion of ex-
ecutive privilege. 
But on June 20th, after the invocation of ex-
ecutive privilege by President Obama, and 
over the requests of several committee mem-
bers to delay action, Chairman ISSA
pro-
ceeded with the contempt vote. 
One question that comes to my mind is why 
the rush? The Committee recently ‘‘com-
pleted’’ a 16-month investigation, one in which 
the committee refused all Democratic requests 
for hearings and even for a single witness. 
Then one week and just seven days after the 
committee reported out the contempt resolu-
tion on a party-line vote on June 20th, the 
House today will vote on this privileged resolu-
tion. 
The last time the House voted on contempt 
resolution against executive branch officials 
was during an investigation in the Bush ad-
ministration into the firing of U.S. Attorneys. In 
that situation, the House Judiciary Committee 
cited two officials for contempt of Congress in 
July 2007. The full House did not actually con-
sider and vote on those contempt resolutions 
until eight months later in February 2008. 
The Obama administration has argued that 
the documents in question in this instance fall 
within the executive privilege because they 
have been generated in the course of the de-
liberative process concerning the Justice De-
partment’s response to Congressional over-
sight, not because the President knew more 
about this matter than he admitted to or that 
there was a conspiracy in the White House, as 
Chairman ISSA falsely asserts. 
For some reason, the Republican majority 
feels that this is a pressing issue. But I can 
think of a large list of other issues that I feel 
that Americans would rather we address. 
It is hard to imagine that the House Repub-
lican majority’s actions are anything else be-
sides election-year politics designed to make 
this administration look bad. This resolution 
will not create jobs, nor will it strengthen our 
economic recovery. It is far past time to get-
ting around to solving the real problems that 
the American people sent each of us here to 
resolve. 
I urge my colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle to carefully consider what we are about 
to do today. Never in our nation’s history has 
the House voted to hold a sitting Attorney 
General in contempt. I urge my colleagues to 
vote down this partisan and political contempt 
resolution. 
The final part I will make is you 
can’t complain that Attorney General 
Holder was here nine times between 
the House and the Senate talking in 
part about Fast and Furious and then 
say that you never had a Democratic 
witness. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, we 
need to deal with facts in this debate 
because this is an important matter. 
The gentleman just talked about 
these hearings, these meetings with 
the head of the ATF. The reality was 
that a year ago Republican staff met 
with the head of the ATF on July 3 
without notifying Democratic staff. 
Democratic staff were invited to come 
on July 4. There were no public hear-
ings, and no Members were there. 
Again, I’m not sure what the problem 
is with having the head of the ATF 
come before the committee so the 
American people can hear what the 
truth is and what the facts are. I don’t 
know why that’s such a big deal. But to 
suggest that this was a bipartisan ef-
fort is just outright false. 
Mr. Speaker, at this time, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Maryland (Ms. EDWARDS). 
Ms. EDWARDS. Mr. Speaker, the Re-
publican majority is pursuing an un-
precedented and a partisan constitu-
tional confrontation today, and it’s un-
necessary. 
The contempt resolution that’s be-
fore the House is both disgraceful and 
it really is demeaning to this House. 
It’s being brought forth by the other 
side simply to drag Attorney General 
Holder through the mud and to pub-
licly accuse him and the administra-
tion and, frankly, by extension, the 
President of the United States, of a 
coverup, claiming that our Attorney 
General was obstructing justice. Re-
publicans even went so far as to call 
him a liar on national television. This 
is unheard of, it is hyperbolic, and it’s 
disrespectful to the office and dis-
respectful to this House. 
The fact is that Chairman ISSA and 
Republicans have continuously moved 
the goalpost and disregarded the good 
intent and good faith shown by the At-
torney General, the Justice Depart-
ment, and the President’s administra-
tion. 
As has been said before, the Depart-
ment of Justice has provided the Con-
gress with over 7,600 pages of docu-
ments and made numerous officials 
available for testimony, but that’s 
been rebuffed. Just last week, the At-
torney General offered to provide even 
more internal documents and requested 
a show simply of good faith on the part 
of the Republican majority that they 
wanted to resolve the contempt issue, 
but they refused, choosing this con-
stitutional 
confrontation 
instead. 
That’s because the Republicans, to be 
clear, are not interested in a resolu-
tion. They’re not looking to com-
promise. They’re only looking to score 
political points at the expense of the 
integrity of the House and the good 
name of the President and the Attor-
ney General.

Mr. NUGENT. Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to inquire how much time re-
mains. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Florida has 91⁄2 minutes 
remaining. The gentleman from Massa-
chusetts has 10 minutes remaining. 
Mr. NUGENT. I will continue to re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. SCHIFF). 
Mr. SCHIFF. I thank the gentleman 
for yielding. 
I rise in strong opposition to this res-
olution. What began as a legitimate in-
vestigation into an operation called 
So I would ask us to carefully con-
sider what we’re doing here today and 
to raise into question what we’re doing 
to this House, to the institution, and to 
the Presidency. I would ask my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle to 
ask themselves whether the American 
people want us to focus on their busi-
ness, to focus on the business of mov-
ing the country forward, or to simply 
play politics because you can’t win any 
other way. 
It’s a really simple proposition that’s 
in front of us today. And I would say to 
my colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle: it is time for us to simply walk 
away from the nonsense that is not 
doing justice to the American people. 
Mr. Speaker, the Republican majority is pur-
suing an unprecedented and partisan constitu-
tional confrontation today. 
The contempt resolution before this House 
is disgraceful and demeaning to the House. 
It’s been brought forth by the other side to 
drag Attorney General Holder through the mud 
and publicly accuse him and the Administra-
tion by extension the President of the U.S. of 
a ‘‘cover-up’’, claiming that Attorney General 
Holder was ‘‘obstructing justice.’’ Republicans 
even went so far as to call him a ‘‘liar’’ on na-
tional television—unheard of, blatantly hyper-
bolic, and disrespectful to the office. 
The fact is that Chairman ISSA and the Re-
publicans have continuously moved the goal-
posts and disregarded the good faith shown 
by the Attorney General, the Justice Depart-
ment, and the President’s Administration. 
All told, the Department of Justice has pro-
vided Congress with over 7,600 pages of doc-
uments and has made numerous high profile 
officials available for public congressional tes-
timony. The Attorney General himself has an-
swered questions at nine public hearings. 
Last week, the Attorney General offered to 
provide even more internal documents, includ-
ing documents outside of Chairman ISSA’S 
subpoena. All the Attorney General requested 
was a show of good faith on the part of the 
Republican majority to resolve the contempt 
issue, but they refused. That’s because the 
Republicans are not looking to compromise. 
They are looking simply to score political 
points at the expense of the integrity of the 
House. 
And so, on June 11th, Chairman ISSA an-
nounced his intention to hold a contempt vote. 
On June 20th, just nine short days later, 
Chairman ISSA called the vote after the Presi-
dent invoked executive privilege. 
From George Washington to George W. 
Bush, Presidents of both political parties have 
asserted executive privilege to protect the con-
fidentiality of certain kinds of executive branch 
information in response to demands by Con-
gress. In fact, dating back to President 
Reagan, Presidents have asserted executive 
privilege 24 times. 
In previous situations, Committee Chairman 
put off contempt proceedings in order to con-
duct serious and careful review of Presidential 
assertions of executive privilege. Then Over-
sight and Government Reform Chairman WAX-
MAN put off a contempt vote after President 
Bush asserted executive privilege in the 
Valarie Plame investigation. Chairman WAX-
MAN did the same when President Bush as-
serted the privilege relating to EPA ozone reg-
ulations—on the same day as the contempt

H4171 
June 28, 2012 
Fast and Furious has, unfortunately, 
degenerated into yet another partisan 
political attack in an election year. 
And it’s a shame this is taking place 
for many reasons. First and foremost, 
because the American people have a le-
gitimate interest in getting to the bot-
tom of the gun violence that spills 
across our border, with the tens of 
thousands of weapons made in America 
that end up in the hands of the cartels. 
But instead of looking into that inves-
tigation, instead of finding out what 
we can do about this gun violence, this 
has now become a fight over docu-
ments, a fight that is completely un-
necessary and unjustified. 
The very documents that are at issue 
in this resolution were created after 
this operation had long since been shut 
down. They will shed no light on the 
operation. They will shed no light on 
what we can do to stop this gun traf-
ficking. But then that’s not the goal. 
The goal here is simply the fight. 
The Justice Department has bent 
over backwards, produced thousands of 
documents. The Attorney General has 
testified eight or nine times before the 
House, has made every effort to cooper-
ate in this investigation, but the com-
mittee will not take ‘‘yes’’ for an an-
swer because that’s not the goal. The 
fight is the goal. 
And so we are here when we should be 
doing the Nation’s business, when we 
should be working on legislation to 
create jobs. Instead, we are here in 
what is nothing less than a partisan 
brawl over nothing. And you know how 
this will end? It will end months or 
years from now with a settlement in 
Federal District Court in which the 
Justice Department will provide the 
very same documents they have al-
ready offered to provide. But we will 
have wasted our time; we will have 
wasted our money; and we will have 
wasted the precious opportunity to get 
the people’s business done here in the 
House. 
In case the majority hasn’t noticed, 
we are in the midst of a very difficult 
economy, where people are struggling 
to find work. They are not struggling 
to find another partisan fight on the 
House floor. This is something that 
cried out for resolution, but those cries 
were ignored. I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote. 
Mr. NUGENT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Utah 
(Mr. CHAFFETZ). 
Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, the 
reason I am so passionate about this 
issue is that it’s about openness, it’s 
about transparency, it’s about the idea 
that there is no one person in our gov-
ernment that’s above the law; that 
when you have a duly issued subpoena, 
you comply with that subpoena. 
In fact, I would like to hearken back 
to the remarks by President Obama as 
he took office. He said: 
Let me say as simply as I can. Trans-
parency and the rule of law will be the 
touchstones of this presidency. I will also 
hold myself, as President, to a new standard 
of openness. But the mere fact that you have 
legal power to keep something secret does 
not mean you should always use it. 
He went on to say: 
I expect members of my administration 
not simply to live up to the letter but also 
the spirit of this law. 
He went on to send something to all 
of the department heads. He said: 
Government should not keep information 
confidential merely because public officials 
might be embarrassed by disclosure, because 
errors or failures might be revealed, or be-
cause of speculative or abstract fears. 
The President further said, relating 
to Fast and Furious: 
There may be a situation here in which a 
serious mistake was made, and if that’s the 
case, we will find out, and we will hold some-
body accountable. 
We have a dead Border Patrol agent. 
We have over 200 dead Mexican people. 
We have a program that the Attorney 
General 
called 
‘‘fundamentally 
flawed.’’ We have thousands of weapons 
that are missing. We have a duty, an 
obligation to pursue this to the fullest 
extent and to make sure that we have 
all those documents so we can make 
sure that it never, ever happens again. 
Now there are 140,000 documents, ac-
cording to the Attorney General, that 
deal with Fast and Furious. We’ve been 
given less than 8,000 of those. Less than 
8,000 of those. We deserve to have that. 
Also, I will be submitting for the 
RECORD this statement from the Na-
tional Border Patrol Council. This is 
the AFL–CIO-oriented organization of 
17,000 Border Patrol members who call 
for the resignation of Attorney General 
Holder. In fact, they say that it’s ‘‘a 
slap in the face to all Border Patrol 
agents who serve this country’’ and 
‘‘an utter failure of leadership at the 
highest levels of government.’’ 
‘‘If Eric Holder were a Border Patrol 
agent and not the Attorney General, he 
would have long ago been found unsuit-
able for government employment and 
terminated.’’ 
These are from the people on the 
front lines. We have an obligation to 
get to the bottom of this. 
[From the National Border Patrol Council, 
June 20, 2012] 
NBPC CALLS FOR THE RESIGNATION OF 
ATTORNEY GENERAL ERIC HOLDER 
JUNE 18, 2012.—The union representing U.S. 
Border Patrol agents called for the resigna-
tion of Attorney General Eric Holder for his 
role in the ‘‘Operation Fast and Furious’’ 
gun smuggling scandal that directly resulted 
in the murder of Border Patrol Agent Brian 
Terry on December 15, 2010. 
National Border Patrol Council President 
George E. McCubbin III called the actions of 
the Attorney General Holder, ‘‘A slap in the 
face to all Border Patrol agents who serve 
this country’’ and ‘‘an utter failure of leader-
ship at the highest levels of government.’’ 
Border Patrol agents are indoctrinated 
from day one of their training that integrity 
is their most important trait as a Border Pa-
trol agent and that without it they have lit-
tle use to the agency. Border Patrol agents 
are quickly disciplined whenever they lie or 
show a lack of candor. The standard that ap-
plies to these agents should at a minimum be 
applied to those who lead them. ‘‘If Eric 
Holder were a Border Patrol agent and not 
the Attorney General, he would have long 
ago been found unsuitable for government 
employment and terminated.’’ 
‘‘The heroism that Border Patrol Agent 
Brian Terry demonstrated on that cold night 
in the dessert of Arizona was in keeping with 
the finest traditions of the United States 
Border Patrol and will never be forgotten by 
those who patrol this nation’s borders. We 
cannot allow our agents to be sacrificed for 
no gain and not hold accountable those who 
approved the ill conceived ‘Operation Fast 
and Furious’ ’’, said McCubbin. 
‘‘The political shenanigans surrounding 
this scandal and the passing of blame must 
stop.’’ A Border Patrol agent cannot acciden-
tally step foot into Mexico without a myriad 
of U.S. and Mexican government agencies 
being made aware, so there is no possible 
way that this operation was conducted with-
out the knowledge and tacit approval of the 
Department of Justice and the Obama ad-
ministration. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself 15 seconds. 
Mr. Speaker, if this is about open-
ness, then why does the committee 
have secret meetings where they lock 
Democrats out? If this is about open-
ness, then why won’t they let any 
Democratic witnesses appear before the 
committee? 
And since there seems to be some 
confusion as to whether or not Demo-
crats actually formally requested wit-
nesses, I will insert into the RECORD a 
letter to the Honorable DARRELL ISSA 
on October 28, on November 4, and on 
February 2, requesting witnesses, in-
cluding the former Attorney General 
Mukasey and Mr. Melson, the head of 
the ATF. 
COMMITTEE ON OVERSIGHT AND GOV-
ERNMENT REFORM, HOUSE OF REP-
RESENTATIVES, 
Washington, DC, October 28, 2011. 
Hon. DARRELL E. ISSA, 
Chairman, Committee on Oversight and Govern-
ment Reform, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: As I have stated re-
peatedly, I believe Operation Fast and Furi-
ous was a terrible mistake with tragic con-
sequences. As I have also stated, I support a 
fair and responsible investigation that fol-
lows the facts where they lead, rather than 
drawing conclusions before evidence is gath-
ered or ignoring information that does not 
fit into a preconceived narrative. 
On several occasions over the past month, 
you have called on Attorney General Eric 
Holder to appear before the House Judiciary 
Committee to answer questions about when 
he first became aware of the controversial 
tactics used in Operation Fast and Furious. 
The Attorney General has now agreed to tes-
tify before the House Judiciary Committee 
on December 8, 2011, when you will have an-
other opportunity to question him directly. 
With respect to our own Committee’s in-
vestigation, I do not believe it will be viewed 
as legitimate or credible—and I do not be-
lieve the public record will be complete— 
without public testimony from Kenneth 
Melson, who served as the Director of the 
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and 
Explosives (ATF). 
A hearing with Mr. Melson would help the 
Committee and the American people better 
understand what mistakes were made in Op-
eration Fast and Furious, how these tactics 
originated, who did and did not authorize 
them. and what steps are being taken to en-
sure that they are not used again. 
Our staffs have already conducted tran-
scribed interviews with Mr. Melson and the

The next day, Special Agent in Charge 
Newell responded in an e-mail, stating: 
I’m so frustrated with this whole mess I’m 
shutting the case down and any further at-
tempts to do something similar. We’re done 
trying to pursue new and innovative initia-
tives—it’s not worth the hassle. 
It is unclear from the documents what 
changed between October 6, 2007, when Spe-
cial Agent in Charge Newell indicated that 
he was shutting down these operations, and 
November 16, 2007, when Attorney General 
Mukasey was presented with a proposal to 
expand them. The documents do not indicate 
whether Attorney General Mukasey read 
this briefing paper or how he responded to 
the proposal to expand these operations. 
ADDITIONAL GUN-WALKING OPERATIONS DURING 
THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION 
former Deputy Director of ATF, William 
Hoover. During those interviews, these offi-
cials expressed serious concerns about the 
controversial tactics employed by the Phoe-
nix Field Division of ATF as part of this op-
eration. They also raised concerns about the 
manner in which the Department of Justice 
responded to congressional inquiries. 
Both officials also stated that they had not 
been aware of the controversial tactics being 
used in Operation Fast and Furious, had not 
authorized those tactics, and had not in-
formed anyone at the Department of Justice 
headquarters about them. They stated that 
Operation Fast and Furious originated with-
in the Phoenix Field Division, and that ATF 
headquarters failed to properly supervise it. 
Since the Attorney General has now agreed 
to appear before Congress in December, I be-
lieve Members also deserve an opportunity 
to question Mr. Melson directly, especially 
since he headed the agency responsible for 
Operation Fast and Furious. My staff has 
been in touch with Mr. Melson’s attorney, 
who reports that Mr. Melson would be 
pleased to cooperate with the Committee. 
Thank you for your consideration of this 
request. 
Sincerely, 
ELIJAH E. CUMMINGS, 
Ranking Member. 
Other documents obtained by the Com-
mittee indicate that the officials who pre-
pared the November 16, 2007, briefing paper 
for Attorney General Mukasey were aware 
that it did not disclose the full scope of pre-
vious gun-walking operations. After review-
ing the briefing paper, Mr. Carroll wrote an 
e-mail to Mr. Hoover, stating: ‘‘I am going to 
ask DOJ to change ‘first ever’.’’ He added: 
‘‘there have [been] cases in the past where 
we have walked guns.’’ 
Mr. Carroll’s statement appears to be a ref-
erence to an earlier operation in 2006 known 
as Operation Wide Receiver. The documents 
obtained by the Committee do not indicate 
whether Attorney General Mukasey was in 
fact informed about this operation, which oc-
curred a year earlier. 
COMMITTEE ON OVERSIGHT AND GOV-
ERNMENT REFORM, HOUSE OF REP-
RESENTATIVES, 
Washington, DC, November 4, 2011. 
Hon. DARRELL E. ISSA, 
Chairman, Committee on Oversight and Govern-
ment Reform, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: I am writing to re-
quest that the Committee hold a hearing 
with 
former 
Attorney 
General 
Michael 
Mukasey in order to assist our efforts in un-
derstanding the inception and development 
of so-called ‘‘gun-walking’’ operations over 
the past five years. 
The documents obtained by the Committee 
appear to directly contradict your claim on 
national television that gun-walking oper-
ations under the previous Administration 
were well coordinated. During an appearance 
on Face the Nation on October 16, 2011, you 
asserted: 
We know that under the Bush Administra-
tion there were similar operations, but they 
were coordinated with Mexico. They made 
every effort to keep their eyes on the weap-
ons the whole time. 
Your assertion was particularly troubling 
since the Committee obtained these e-mail 
exchanges in July, several months before 
your appearance on Face the Nation. 
CONCLUSION 
Over the past year, you have been ex-
tremely critical of Attorney General Eric 
Holder, arguing that he should have known 
about the controversial tactics employed in 
these operations. He has now agreed to your 
request to testify before the House Judiciary 
Committee on December 8, 2011, to answer 
additional questions about these operations. 
Given the significant questions raised by 
the disclosures in these documents, our Com-
mittee’s investigation will not be viewed as 
credible, even-handed, or complete unless we 
hear 
directly 
from 
Attorney 
General 
Mukasey. 
During a press appearance on Wednesday, 
you stated: ‘‘Our job for the American people 
is to make sure—since they say they 
shouldn’t walk guns and they did walk 
guns—is that we know they’ll never walk 
guns again.’’ I completely agree with this 
statement, and I believe my request will help 
us fulfill our shared goal. Thank you for 
your consideration of this request. 
Sincerely, 
ELIJAH E. CUMMINGS, 
Ranking Member. 
THE MUKASEY MEMO 
Documents obtained by the Committee in-
dicate that Attorney General Mukasey was 
briefed on November 16, 2007, on a botched 
gun-walking operation by the Bureau of Al-
cohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives 
(ATF). A briefing paper prepared for Attor-
ney General Mukasey prior to a meeting 
with Mexican Attorney General Medina 
Mora describes ‘‘the first-ever attempt to 
have a controlled delivery of weapons being 
smuggled into Mexico by a major arms traf-
ficker.’’ The briefing paper warns, however, 
that ‘‘the first attempts at this controlled 
delivery have not been successful.’’ Despite 
these failures, the briefing paper proposes 
expanding such operations in the future. It 
states: 
ATF would like to expand the possibility 
of such joint investigations and controlled 
deliveries—since only then will it be possible 
to investigate an entire smuggling network, 
rather than arresting simply a single smug-
gler. 
Attorney General Mukasey’s briefing paper 
was prepared only weeks after ATF officials 
had expressed serious concerns with the fail-
ure of these tactics and claimed they were 
shutting them down. After ATF officials dis-
covered that firearms were not being inter-
dicted, William Hoover, then ATF’s assistant 
director of field operations, wrote an e-mail 
on October 5, 2007, to Carson Carroll, ATF’s 
assistant director for enforcement programs, 
stating: 
I do not want any firearms to go South 
until further notice. I expect a full briefing 
paper on my desk Tuesday morning from 
SAC Newell [Special Agent in Charge Wil-
liam Newell] with every question answered. 
COMMITTEE ON OVERSIGHT AND GOV-
ERNMENT REFORM, HOUSE OF REP-
RESENTATIVES, 
Washington, DC, February 2, 2012. 
Hon. DARRELL E. ISSA, 
Chairman, Committee on Oversight and Govern-
ment Reform, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR
MR. CHAIRMAN: Given your state-
ments at today’s hearing, I am writing to 
formally reiterate my previous request for 
the Committee to hold a public hearing with 
former Attorney General Michael Mukasey. 
On November 4, 2011, I wrote to you re-
questing a public hearing with Mr. Mukasey 
in order to assist the Committee’s efforts in 
understanding the inception and develop-
ment of so-called ‘‘gunwalking’’ operations 
over the past five years in Arizona. 
As I described in the letter, the Committee 
has now obtained a briefing paper prepared 
for Mr. Mukasey prior to a meeting with 
Mexican Attorney General Medina Mora. The 
briefing paper describes efforts in 2007 by the 
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and 
Explosives (ATF) to coordinate interdiction 
efforts with Mexico after firearms crossed 
the border. The briefing paper warns, how-
ever, that ‘‘the first attempts at this con-
trolled delivery have not been successful.’’ 
Despite these failures, the briefing paper 
proposes expanding such operations in the 
future. It states: 
ATF would like to expand the possibility 
of such joint investigations and controlled 
deliveries—since only then will it be possible 
to investigate an entire smuggling network, 
rather than arresting simply a single smug-
gler. 
Since I sent the letter to you in November, 
the Committee has not held a public hearing 
with Mr. Mukasey. 
In addition to these documents, I issued a 
report this week documenting that Oper-
ation Fast and Furious was actually the 
fourth in a series of reckless operations run 
by the Phoenix Field Division of ATF and 
the Arizona U.S. Attorney’s Office dating 
back to 2006 involving hundreds of weapons 
across two administrations. 
At today’s hearing, several Members of the 
Committee acknowledged that the docu-
ments obtained by the Committee do not in-
dicate 
that 
Mr. 
Mukasey 
approved 
gunwalking, just as they do not indicate 
that Attorney General Holder approved 
gunwalking. Nevertheless, these Members 
expressed their belief that Mr. Mukasey’s 
public testimony is necessary if the Com-
mittee intends to conduct a thorough and 
evenhanded investigation of this five-year 
history of gunwalking in Arizona. 
During an exchange with Committee Mem-
ber Gerry Connolly at today’s hearing, you 
stated that you were open to all requests for 
hearings relating to this investigation. At-
torney General Holder has now testified pub-
licly six times about these issues. It is only 
appropriate for the Committee and the pub-
lic to hear testimony from Mr. Mukasey at 
least once. 
Thank you for your consideration of this 
request. 
Sincerely, 
ELIJAH E. CUMMINGS, 
Ranking Member. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. JOHN-
SON). 
Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, today we need to understand that 
there are two classes of documents. 
The ones that relate to pending crimi-
nal investigations, those are not dis-
coverable or cannot be distributed out-
side of the Justice Department under

then was approved by the U.S. attorney 
in the Phoenix area, and then went to 
the Department of Justice—not to the 
head of ATF—but to the Department of 
Justice, to DOJ and their leadership, to 
be approved. 
b 1330 
It is essential that we know what was 
done there and who did it in the proc-
ess. So this is not some ancillary thing 
that’s added to it. This is an important 
part of this process. 
Now, there’s all this obfuscation to 
say it’s Bush’s fault, this is political, 
there’s not enough witnesses. The es-
sence of this particular contempt deals 
with the documents that, on February 
4 of last year, the Department of Jus-
tice sent us a letter that said they had 
no idea about this. And then by Decem-
ber, after all yearlong saying, No, we 
didn’t know, we didn’t know, we didn’t 
know, come back in December and say, 
Oops, we did. It is what Eric Holder has 
called his evolving truth. 
We want to know the facts of how it 
started here and went here. There’s 
130,000 documents that they say they 
have. They have turned over a little 
over 7,000 of those documents. This is 
not the prerogative for them to con-
tinue to hold and conceal those docu-
ments. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. NUGENT. I yield the gentleman 
an additional 15 seconds. 
Mr. LANKFORD. Fast and Furious 
has moved to slow and tedious. We 
have got to have those documents to be 
able to finish up this investigation. It 
should have long since been done. 
Eric Holder told our chairman that 
he has these documents, but he’s using 
the documents as a bargaining chip to 
get a better deal. This is not the pre-
rogative when we have a subpoena. 
We are not looking for some conflict 
with the administration. We’re looking 
to get to the facts. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
11⁄2
minutes to the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. FATTAH). 
Mr. FATTAH. I thank the gentleman. 
I served for many years on the Over-
sight and Government Reform Com-
mittee. I’ve been involved in a lot of 
these investigations over time. I served 
for many years on the House Ethics 
Committee. 
The Congress should be embarrassed 
about the conduct of this investigation 
and the charade that brings us to the 
floor today. The Attorney General 
can’t provide these documents. The 
President has protected them under ex-
ecutive 
order, 
executive 
privilege, 
which means that the person who 
works for the President can’t provide 
them to the Congress. We all know 
that. So to take a decent man who’s 
served his country in almost every ca-
pacity—as a military veteran, as a U.S. 
attorney here in D.C., as a judge—and 
to drag his name wrongfully before this 
House, this majority, which clearly has 
lost its way—in their pursuit of power, 
penalty of U.S. law. You can get 5 
years for doing that. You can’t expect 
the Attorney General to turn those 
over. The other class of documents is 
internal communications. There may 
be some whiff of discoverable informa-
tion in those, but they’re covered by 
executive privilege. And you really 
don’t know why the Attorney General 
has invoked executive privilege on 
those issues, but we have to trust the 
fact that there’s good reason for that 
to be the case. 
Now when you compare what has 
gone on today and over the last 7 days 
with what happened the day that Presi-
dent Obama was sworn in, you can un-
derstand 
why 
they’re 
doing 
what 
they’re doing today. You see, not very 
long after President Obama was sworn 
in, we got word that MITCH MCCONNELL 
said that his mission was to make 
President Obama a one-term President. 
And then we know that later on that 
afternoon, later that evening, when ev-
eryone else was enjoying themselves at 
the Presidential balls, there was a 
group of Congresspeople—leadership in 
the 
Republican 
Party—that 
were 
scheming on how they were going to 
disrupt and say ‘‘no’’ and obstruct ev-
erything that this President put forth. 
So they have done that. They have 
done everything they can to make this 
President look bad. 
This is a manufactured crisis. It has 
no legal substance whatsoever. This is 
just simply a cheap political stunt to 
bring disfavor upon the President of 
the United States. And I ask my col-
leagues to not let us sink to this level. 
It is the first time in history that any 
Cabinet member has been found in con-
tempt of Congress. This is truly sad-
dening. 
Mr. NUGENT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 90 
seconds to the gentleman from Okla-
homa (Mr. LANKFORD). 
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. Speaker, I 
would have to concur. This is an in-
credibly sad day. This administration 
that 
started 
talking 
about 
trans-
parency has now sunk to the level of 
actually concealing documents. 
Never has an Attorney General been 
held in contempt of Congress because 
every other Attorney General has 
turned over documents to Congress 
when they were requested. This Attor-
ney General has not. 
I would just compare this whole con-
troversy with the Secret Service scan-
dal from several months ago. They put 
everything out, released all the docu-
ments, walked through it. It was done. 
The GSA scandal, released all the docu-
ments, held people accountable. It was 
done. ATF even, when we started this 
investigation a year and a half ago, put 
all their documents out, put all their 
people out, done. 
As soon as we get to the Department 
of Justice, it’s slow. It’s delay, it’s 
delay, it’s delay. The question is, Why? 
Why this matters when we get to the 
Department of Justice documents? Be-
cause in the Phoenix office, everything 
was organized in the Phoenix office, 
they have lost all sense of principle— 
this is a disgraceful act. 
But we will get through it. We are a 
big country, and the American people 
will recognize the disservice that the 
Republican majority brings to this 
floor today. 
I wouldn’t be surprised, at the end of 
the day, whether we couldn’t even find 
this Congress held in more contempt 
than it is now. I think we’re at a 9 per-
cent approval rate. That’s because of 
the actions of this majority. And the 
public will have to take account of 
that as we go forward. 
Mr. NUGENT. I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentlelady from Cali-
fornia (Ms. SPEIER). 
Ms. SPEIER. I thank the gentleman 
from Massachusetts. 
This should be labeled ‘‘Fast and 
Foolish’’ or maybe ‘‘Fast and Fake.’’ 
We are not talking about gunwalking 
here. We are doing nothing to help the 
family of Brian Terry recover. What 
we’re talking about are interoffice 
emails between the administration ex-
ecutives in the AG’s office. I want ev-
eryone here to be willing to turn over 
all of their interoffice emails. 
But, more importantly, let’s talk 
about whether there’s precedence for 
the assertion of executive privilege. 
And let me just point to a number of 
cases when executive privilege was as-
serted for noninvolved Presidential 
communications. 
In October 1981, President Reagan as-
serted executive privilege over internal 
deliberations within the Department of 
the Interior concerning, interestingly 
enough, the Mineral Lands Leasing 
Act. 
In October 1982, President Reagan as-
serted executive privilege over internal 
EPA files concerning Superfund provi-
sions. 
In July 1986, President Reagan as-
serted executive privilege over docu-
ments written by William Rehnquist 
when he was the head of the OLC at 
DOJ. 
In August 1991, President George 
H.W. Bush asserted executive privilege 
over an internal Defense Department 
memorandum regarding an aircraft de-
velopment contract. 
In December 2011, President George 
W. Bush asserted executive privilege 
over internal Justice Department ma-
terials relating to prosecutorial deci-
sionmaking. 
It has been done many, many times 
before by Republican Presidents. What 
we are doing here is a travesty to this 
institution and to this country. 
Mr. NUGENT. I continue to reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, can I 
inquire of the gentleman from Florida 
how many more speakers he has, be-
cause we have no more speakers on this 
side but myself. 
Mr. NUGENT. We have no more 
speakers. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time.

H4174 
June 28, 2012 
the Constitution in regards to our abil-
ity to have oversight. 
I hear this stuff about witch hunt and 
about politics and it gets me sick, be-
cause I will tell you this: as a former 
law enforcement officer, we should be 
more worried about what lousy policies 
that Attorney General Holder has cov-
ered up that caused the death of one of 
our own in protecting this country. 
That’s what this is all about. This is 
about holding people accountable. 
I hear a lot of things down here. But 
the rule of law, when I was subpoenaed 
as a sheriff, we complied with the sub-
poena. I understand that the Attorney 
General feels that he’s above the law in 
regards to the subpoena, and I under-
stand the President’s come in to pro-
tect him. 
But we talk about this body and what 
the American people think. How about 
we do the right thing, Mr. Speaker, and 
we move forward and do the right thing 
in regards to all the Attorney General 
has to do is comply with the subpoena. 
By saying that he’s bent over back-
wards, I would suggest to you that 
under 8,000 pages of documents out of 
140,000 is not bending over backwards. 
This is about our constitutional re-
sponsibility to provide oversight. This 
is about our constitutional responsi-
bility to make sure that the Federal 
Government stays on track, that these 
executive branch decisions that are 
made don’t put more Americans at 
risk. 
Nobody seems to care about the 200- 
plus Mexican nationals that have been 
killed. Obviously, Mexico cares because 
they want to indict those that were re-
sponsible for coming up with this failed 
idea. 
b 1340 
This is about Congress doing its con-
stitutional 
responsibility, 
holding 
hearings to find out what happened. 
And when the Federal Government or 
branches of the Federal Government 
stand in the way and obstruct, that’s 
not the right thing to do. My friends on 
the other side of the aisle should be 
more concerned that the Attorney Gen-
eral has said to the Congress: Guess 
what, you don’t matter. 
Congress does matter. Congress has a 
constitutional 
responsibility, 
Mr. 
Speaker, to do just that, to have over-
sight over the executive branch, and 
the subpoena is a tool to allow us to do 
that. And, unfortunately, this Attor-
ney General feels he doesn’t have to 
comply. I beg to differ. 
I think the American people—but 
more than that, the family of Officer 
Terry—deserve to know what tran-
spired and what the end of this is. And 
I think that we should be protecting 
those law enforcement officers that are 
out there today. In the United States 
of America, they are going to be facing 
these same guns that were walked dur-
ing Fast and Furious. If you read the 
transcripts, 
hundreds—hundreds—of 
guns walked. Some have been recov-
ered in the United States. And, unfor-
Mr. Speaker, there isn’t a single per-
son in this House who doesn’t honor 
the service of Agent Terry. There isn’t 
a single person in this House who does 
not want justice for Agent Terry’s fam-
ily—and the truth. There isn’t a single 
person in this House, I believe, who 
doesn’t want to get to the bottom of 
how gunwalking started and how these 
operations were so terribly botched. 
But every single attempt for an even-
handed investigation has been thwart-
ed by the Republican majority. There 
has not been an evenhanded investiga-
tion. Every single witness that the 
Democrats requested to be called be-
fore the committee was refused. Every 
single witness. It’s unprecedented. 
Let me say that Eric Holder is a good 
and decent and honorable man. He’s 
doing an excellent job as Attorney 
General. He does not deserve this. And 
this institution does not deserve this. 
I say to my friends on the other side 
of the aisle: Do you really want to go 
down this road? This is a race to the 
bottom. This is a witch hunt. This is 
politics, pure and simple. It diminishes 
this House of Representatives. We are 
better than this. 
Does everything have to be a con-
frontation? Does everything have to be 
in your face? 
Now, you want to maintain your ma-
jority. I get it. You want to win elec-
tions. That’s understandable. But at 
what cost? Do we really need to drag 
the House of Representatives down this 
road? 
This is a stain on this House of Rep-
resentatives. We should not be here 
today. We should be talking about jobs 
and putting people back to work and 
about making sure student loans don’t 
double. But instead, we are doing this. 
This is so political and so blatantly 
partisan that I think the American 
people are sickened by this. And as a 
number of people have said, You want 
to know why the approval rating is so 
low? Watch the videotape of this de-
bate here today. We should be doing 
the peoples’ business. 
This is not the peoples’ business. 
This is not about getting to the truth 
in the case of Agent Terry. This is a 
political maneuver to go after this ad-
ministration. And this has, unfortu-
nately, become a trend and a pattern in 
this Congress. We need to find a way to 
solve our problems without always 
having these big confrontations. 
So I urge my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle, don’t go down this 
road. We urged the Speaker of the 
House yesterday to pull this from the 
floor. This is wrong. Please defeat this 
rule. 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. NUGENT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
This is about Agent Terry, who gave 
his life for this country. This is about 
what this government has done not to 
expose the truth but to block the 
truth. This is about calling on the At-
torney General to follow the Constitu-
tion. It’s about us following article I of 
tunately, some have been recovered in 
Mexico and have led to deaths in Mex-
ico. One has to wonder how many of 
those guns are going to lead to deaths 
here in America. 
You know, when I raised my hand, 
along with everybody else, it was to 
support and defend the Constitution. 
When I raised my hand as a sheriff, it 
was to support and defend the Con-
stitution. And when Officer Terry 
raised his hand, it was to support and 
defend the Constitution and the laws of 
the United States of America. 
We owe it to all of our law enforce-
ment officers—Federal law enforce-
ment officers, in particular—on this 
issue, to make sure that they’re pro-
tected. And to all of our local law en-
forcement officers who are going to be 
the first line of defense on the streets 
of our cities and counties, they have a 
right to know what this Attorney Gen-
eral’s office and the leadership has 
done, not giving people a free pass be-
cause it is expedient to do and because 
we really don’t want to hear what the 
absolute facts are. Let’s just push the 
facts aside. 
Those on the other side of the aisle 
really don’t want to talk about the 
facts. They want to talk about it is a 
witch hunt or it’s politics. 
The facts are clear. Officer Terry is 
dead. Officer Terry died because weap-
ons were allowed to walk from the 
United States under the nose of the 
ATF and under the nose of the Attor-
ney 
General’s 
office 
through 
an 
OCDETF case. Those are the facts. 
I would suggest that we should find 
out how did that come to pass. And 
then in regards to what was transpired 
and sent to Congress and Members of 
Congress about the fact that it didn’t 
really occur, and then 10 months later, 
Oh, by the way, you know that memo 
we sent, it wasn’t correct; we did, in 
fact, allow guns to walk. 
We put law enforcement officers of 
the United States of America at risk 
because this Federal Government had a 
botched idea and a bad idea. 
Mr. NUGENT. With that, I yield back 
the balance of my time, and I move the 
previous question on the resolution. 
The previous question was ordered. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the resolution. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the noes appeared to have it. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The yeas and nays were ordered. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 8 of rule XX, this 15- 
minute vote on House Resolution 708 
will be followed by 5-minute votes on 
suspending the rules and passing: H.R. 
4251, if ordered; and H.R. 4005, if or-
dered. 
The vote was taken by electronic de-
vice, and there were—yeas 254, nays 
173, not voting 5, as follows:

I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
The Department of Justice has refused to 
comply with congressional subpoenas related 
to Operation Fast and Furious, an Adminis-
tration initiative that allowed around two 
thousand firearms to fall into the hands of 
drug cartels and may have led to the death 
of a U.S. Border Patrol Agent. The con-
sequences of the lack of judgment that per-
mitted such an operation to occur are tragic. 
The Department’s refusal to work with 
Congress to ensure that it has fully complied 
with the Committee’s efforts to compel the 
production of documents and information re-
lated to this controversy is inexcusable and 
cannot stand. Those responsible for allowing 
Fast and Furious to proceed and those who 
are preventing the truth about the operation 
from coming out must be held accountable 
for their actions. 
Having exhausted all available options in 
obtaining compliance, the Chairman of the 
Oversight and Government Reform Com-
mittee recommends that Congress find the 
Attorney General in contempt for his failure 
to comply with the subpoena issued to him. 
II. AUTHORITY AND PURPOSE 
An important corollary to the powers ex-
pressly granted to Congress by the Constitu-
tion is the implicit responsibility to perform 
rigorous oversight of the Executive Branch. 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized this 
Congressional power on numerous occasions. 
For example, in McGrain v. Daugherty, the 
Court held that ‘‘the power of inquiry—with 
process to enforce it—is an essential and ap-
propriate auxiliary to the legislative func-
tion. . . . A legislative body cannot legislate 
wisely or effectively in the absence of infor-
mation respecting the conditions which the 
legislation is intended to affect or change, 
and where the legislative body does not itself 
possess the requisite information—which not 
infrequently is true—recourse must be had 
to others who do possess it.’’ 1 Further, in 
Watkins v. United States, Chief Justice War-
ren wrote for the majority: ‘‘The power of 
Congress to conduct investigations is inher-
ent in the legislative process. That power is 
broad.’’ 2 
Both the Legislative Reorganization Act of 
1946 (P.L. 79–601), which directed House and 
Senate Committees to ‘‘exercise continuous 
watchfulness’’ over Executive Branch pro-
grams under their jurisdiction, and the Leg-
islative Reorganization Act of 1970 (P.L. 91– 
510), which authorized committees to ‘‘re-
view and study, on a continuing basis, the 
application, administration and execution’’ 
of laws, codify the oversight powers of Con-
gress. 
The Committee on Oversight and Govern-
ment Reform is a standing committee of the 
House of Representatives, duly established 
pursuant to the Rules of the House of Rep-
resentatives, which are adopted pursuant to 
the Rulemaking Clause of the Constitution.3 
House rule X grants to the Committee broad 
oversight jurisdiction, including authority 
to ‘‘conduct investigations of any matter 
without regard to clause 1, 2, 3, or this clause 
[of House rule X] conferring jurisdiction over 
the 
matter 
to 
another 
standing 
com-
mittee.’’ 4 The rules direct the Committee to 
make 
available 
‘‘the 
findings 
and 
rec-
ommendations of the committee . . . to any 
other standing committee having jurisdic-
tion over the matter involved.’’ 5 
House rule XI specifically authorizes the 
Committee to ‘‘require, by subpoena or oth-
erwise, the attendance and testimony of such

RECOMMENDING THAT ATTORNEY 
GENERAL 
ERIC 
HOLDER 
BE 
FOUND IN CONTEMPT OF CON-
GRESS 
Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, by direction 
of the Committee on Oversight and 
Government Reform, I call up the re-
port (H.Rept. 112–546) to accompany 
resolution 
recommending 
that 
the 
House of Representatives find Eric H. 
Holder, Jr., Attorney General, U.S. De-
partment of Justice, in contempt of 
Congress for refusal to comply with a 
subpoena duly issued by the Committee 
on Oversight and Government Reform. 
The Clerk read the title of the report. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 708, the report 
is considered read. 
The text of the report is as follows: 
The Committee on Oversight and Govern-
ment Reform, having considered this Report, 
report favorably thereon and recommend 
that the Report be approved. 
The form of the resolution that the Com-
mittee on Oversight and Government Reform 
would recommend to the House of Represent-
atives for citing Eric H. Holder, Jr., Attor-
ney General, U.S. Department of Justice, for 
contempt of Congress pursuant to this report 
is as follows: 
Resolved, That Eric H. Holder, Jr., Attor-
ney General of the United States, shall be 
found to be in contempt of Congress for fail-
ure to comply with a congressional sub-
poena. 
Resolved, That pursuant to 2 U.S.C. 192 and 
194, the Speaker of the House of Representa-
tives shall certify the report of the Com-
mittee on Oversight and Government Re-
form, detailing the refusal of Eric H. Holder, 
Jr., Attorney General, U.S. Department of 
Justice, to produce documents to the Com-
mittee on Oversight and Government Reform 
as directed by subpoena, to the United 
States Attorney for the District of Colum-
bia, to the end that Mr. Holder be proceeded 
against in the manner and form provided by 
law. 
Resolved, That the Speaker of the House 
shall otherwise take all appropriate action 
to enforce the subpoena. 
NOTICE OF INTENTION TO OFFER 
RESOLUTION RAISING A QUES-
TION OF THE PRIVILEGES OF 
THE HOUSE 
Ms. JACKSON LEE of Texas. Mr. 
Speaker, pursuant to clause 2(a)(1) of 
rule IX, I rise to give notice of my in-
tent to raise a question of the privi-
leges of the House. 
The form of the resolution is as fol-
lows: 
Whereas the chair of the Committee on 
Oversight and Government Reform has inter-
fered with the work of an independent agen-
cy and pressured an administrative law judge 
of the National Labor Relations Board by 
compelling the production of documents re-
lated to an ongoing case, something inde-
pendent experts said ‘‘could seriously under-
mine the authority of those charged with en-
forcing the nation’s labor laws’’ and which 
the House Ethics Manual discourages by not-
ing that ‘‘Federal courts have nullified ad-
ministrative decisions on grounds of due 
process and fairness towards all of the par-
ties when congressional interference with 
ongoing 
administrative 
proceedings 
may 
have unduly influenced the outcome’’; 
Whereas the chair of the Committee on 
Oversight and Government Reform has po-
liticized investigations by rolling back long-
standing bipartisan precedents, including by 
authorizing subpoenas without the concur-
rence of the ranking member or a committee 
vote, by refusing to share documents and 
other information with the ranking member, 
and restricting the minority’s right to call 
witnesses at hearings; 
Whereas the chair of the Committee on 
Oversight and Government Reform has jeop-
ardized an ongoing criminal investigation by 
publicly releasing documents that his own 
staff has admitted were under court seal; 
Whereas the chair of the Committee on 
Oversight and Government Reform has uni-
laterally subpoenaed a witness who was ex-
pected to testify at an upcoming Federal 
trial, despite longstanding precedent and ob-
jections from the Department of Justice that 
such a step could cause complications at a 
trial and potentially jeopardize a criminal 
conviction; 
Whereas the chair of the Committee on 
Oversight and Government Reform has en-
gaged in a witch hunt, through the use of re-
peated incorrect and uncorroborated state-
ments in the committee’s ‘‘Fast and Furi-
ous’’ investigation; and 
Whereas the chair of the Committee on 
Oversight and Government Reform has cho-
sen to call the Attorney General of the 
United States a liar on national television 
without corroborating evidence and has ex-
hibited unprofessional behavior which could 
result in jeopardizing an ongoing Committee 
investigation into Operation Fast and Furi-
ous: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representa-
tives disapproves of the behavior of the chair

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4178 
June 28, 2012 
In mid-November 2009, just weeks after the 
strategy was issued, Fast and Furious began. 
Its objective was to establish a nexus be-
tween straw purchasers of firearms in the 
United States and Mexican drug-trafficking 
organizations (DTOs) operating on both sides 
of the United States-Mexico border. Straw 
purchasers are individuals who are legally 
entitled to purchase firearms for themselves, 
but who unlawfully purchase weapons with 
the intent to transfer them to someone else, 
in this case DTOs or other criminals. 
During Fast and Furious, ATF agents used 
an 
investigative 
technique 
known 
as 
‘‘gunwalking’’—that is, allowing illegally- 
purchased weapons to be transferred to third 
parties without attempting to disrupt or 
deter the illegal activity. ATF agents aban-
doned surveillance on known straw pur-
chasers after they illegally purchased weap-
ons that ATF agents knew were destined for 
Mexican drug cartels. Many of these trans-
actions established probable cause for agents 
to interdict the weapons or arrest the posses-
sors, something every agent was trained to 
do. Yet, Fast and Furious aimed instead to 
allow the transfer of these guns to third par-
ties. In this manner, the guns fell into the 
hands of DTOs, and many would turn up at 
crime scenes. ATF then traced these guns to 
their original straw purchaser, in an attempt 
to establish a connection between that indi-
vidual and the DTO. 
Federal Firearms Licensees (FFLs), who 
cooperated with ATF, were an integral com-
ponent of Fast and Furious. Although some 
FFLs were reluctant to continue selling 
weapons to suspicious straw purchasers, ATF 
encouraged them to do so, reassuring the 
FFLs that ATF was monitoring the buyers 
and that the weapons would not fall into the 
wrong hands.9 ATF worked with FFLs on or 
about the date of sale to obtain the unique 
serial number of each firearm sold. Agents 
entered these serial numbers into ATF’s Sus-
pect Gun Database within days after the pur-
chase. Once these firearms were recovered at 
crime scenes, the Suspect Gun Database al-
lowed for expedited tracing of the firearms 
to their original purchasers. 
By December 18, 2009, ATF agents assigned 
to Fast and Furious had already identified 
fifteen interconnected straw purchasers in 
the targeted gun trafficking ring. These 
straw purchasers had already purchased 500 
firearms.10 In a biweekly update to Bill New-
ell, ATF Group Supervisor David Voth ex-
plained that 50 of the 500 firearms purchased 
by straw buyers had already been recovered 
in Mexico or near the Mexican border.11 
These guns had time-to-crimes of as little as 
one day, strongly indicating straw pur-
chasing.12 
Starting in late 2009, many line agents ob-
jected vociferously to some of the techniques 
used during Fast and Furious, including 
gunwalking. The investigation continued for 
another year, however, until shortly after 
December 15, 2010, when two weapons from 
Fast and Furious were recovered at the mur-
der scene of U.S. Border Patrol Agent Brian 
Terry. 
Pursuant to the Deputy Attorney Gen-
eral’s strategy, in late January 2010 the ATF 
Phoenix Field Division applied for Fast and 
Furious to become an Organized Crime Drug 
Enforcement Task Force (OCDETF) case. In 
preparation for the OCDETF application 
process, the ATF Phoenix Field Division pre-
pared a briefing paper detailing the inves-
tigative strategy employed in Fast and Furi-
ous. This document was not initially pro-
duced by the Department pursuant to its 
On October 11, 2011, the Justice Depart-
ment informed the Committee its document 
production pursuant to the March 31, 2011, 
subpoena was complete. The next day, the 
Committee issued a detailed subpoena to At-
torney General Eric Holder for additional 
documents related to Fast and Furious. 
On February 2, 2012, the Committee held a 
hearing entitled ‘‘Fast and Furious: Manage-
ment Failures at the Department of Jus-
tice.’’ The Attorney General testified at that 
hearing. 
The Committee has issued two staff re-
ports documenting its initial investigative 
findings. The first, The Department of Justice’s 
Operation Fast and Furious: Accounts of ATF 
Agents, was released on June 14, 2011. The 
second, The Department of Justice’s Operation 
Fast and Furious: Fueling Cartel Violence, was 
released on July 26, 2011. 
Throughout the investigation, the Com-
mittee has made numerous attempts to ac-
commodate the interests of the Department 
of Justice. Committee staff has conducted 
numerous meetings and phone conversations 
with Department lawyers to clarify and 
highlight priorities with respect to the sub-
poenas. Committee staff has been flexible in 
scheduling dates for transcribed interviews; 
agreed to review certain documents in cam-
era; allowed extensions of production dead-
lines; agreed to postpone interviewing the 
Department’s key Fast and Furious trial 
witness; and narrowed the scope of docu-
ments the Department must produce to be in 
compliance with the subpoena and to avoid 
contempt proceedings. 
Despite the Committee’s flexibility, the 
Department has refused to produce certain 
documents to the Committee. The Depart-
ment has represented on numerous occasions 
that it will not produce broad categories of 
documents. The Department has not pro-
vided a privilege log delineating with par-
ticularity why certain documents are being 
withheld. 
The Department’s efforts at accommoda-
tion and ability to work with the Committee 
regarding its investigation into Fast and Fu-
rious have been wholly inadequate. The Com-
mittee requires the subpoenaed documents 
to meet its constitutionally mandated over-
sight and legislative duties. 
IV. 
OPERATION 
FAST 
AND 
FURIOUS: 
BREAKDOWNS AT ALL LEVELS OF THE 
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE 
The story of Operation Fast and Furious is 
one of widespread dysfunction across numer-
ous components of the Department of Jus-
tice. This dysfunction allowed Fast and Furi-
ous to originate and grow at a local level be-
fore senior officials at Department of Justice 
headquarters ultimately approved and au-
thorized it. The dysfunction within and 
among Department components continues to 
this day. 
A. THE ATF PHOENIX FIELD DIVISION 
In October 2009, the Office of the Deputy 
Attorney General (ODAG) in Washington, 
D.C. promulgated a new strategy to combat 
gun trafficking along the Southwest Border. 
This new strategy directed federal law en-
forcement to shift its focus away from seiz-
ing firearms from criminals as soon as pos-
sible, and to focus instead on identifying 
members of trafficking networks. The Office 
of the Deputy Attorney General shared this 
strategy with the heads of many Department 
components, including ATF.8 
Members of the ATF Phoenix Field Divi-
sion, led by Special Agent in Charge Bill 
Newell, became familiar with this new strat-
egy and used it in creating Fast and Furious. 
witnesses and the production of such books, 
records, correspondence, memoranda, papers, 
and documents as it considers necessary.’’ 6 
The rule further provides that the ‘‘power to 
authorize and issue subpoenas’’ may be dele-
gated to the Committee chairman.7 The sub-
poenas discussed in this report were issued 
pursuant to this authority. 
The Committee’s investigation into ac-
tions by senior officials in the U.S. Depart-
ment of Justice and the Bureau of Alcohol, 
Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) in 
designing, implementing, and supervising 
the execution of Operation Fast and Furious, 
and subsequently providing false denials to 
Congress, is being undertaken pursuant to 
the authority delegated to the Committee 
under House Rule X as described above. 
The oversight and legislative purposes of 
the investigations are (1) to examine and ex-
pose any possible malfeasance, abuse of au-
thority, or violation of existing law on the 
part of the executive branch with regard to 
the conception and implementation of Oper-
ation Fast and Furious, and (2) based on the 
results of the investigation, to assess wheth-
er the conduct uncovered may warrant addi-
tions or modifications to federal law and to 
make appropriate legislative recommenda-
tions. 
In particular, the Committee’s investiga-
tion has highlighted the need to obtain infor-
mation that will aid Congress in considering 
whether a revision of the statutory provi-
sions governing the approval of federal wire-
tap applications may be necessary. The 
major breakdown in the process that oc-
curred with respect to the Fast and Furious 
wiretap applications necessitates careful ex-
amination of the facts before proposing a 
legislative 
remedy. 
Procedural 
improve-
ments may need to be codified in statute to 
mandate immediate action in the face of 
highly objectionable information relating to 
operational tactics and details contained in 
future applications. 
The Committee’s investigation has called 
into question the ability of ATF to carry out 
its statutory mission and the ability of the 
Department of Justice to adequately super-
vise it. The information sought is needed to 
consider legislative remedies to restructure 
ATF as needed. 
III. BACKGROUND ON THE COMMITTEE’S 
INVESTIGATION 
In February 2011, the Oversight and Gov-
ernment Reform Committee joined Senator 
Charles E. Grassley, Ranking Member of the 
Senate Committee on the Judiciary, in in-
vestigating Operation Fast and Furious, a 
program conducted by ATF. On March 16, 
2011, Chairman Darrell Issa wrote to then- 
Acting ATF Director Kenneth E. Melson re-
questing documents and information regard-
ing Fast and Furious. Responding for Melson 
and ATF, the Department of Justice did not 
provide any documents or information to the 
Committee by the March 30, 2011, deadline. 
The Committee issued a subpoena to Melson 
the next day. The Department produced zero 
pages of non-public documents pursuant to 
that subpoena until June 10, 2011, on the eve 
of the Committee’s first Fast and Furious 
hearing. 
On June 13, 2011, the Committee held a 
hearing entitled ‘‘Obstruction of Justice: 
Does the Justice Department Have to Re-
spond to a Lawfully Issued and Valid Con-
gressional Subpoena?’’ The Committee held 
a second hearing on June 15, 2011, entitled 
‘‘Operation Fast and Furious: Reckless Deci-
sions, Tragic Outcomes.’’ The Committee 
held a third hearing on July 26, 2011, entitled 
‘‘Operation Fast and Furious: The Other Side 
of the Border.’’

subpoena, but rather was obtained by a con-
fidential source. The briefing paper stated: 
Currently our strategy is to allow the 
transfer of firearms to continue to take 
place, albeit at a much slower pace, in order 
to further the investigation and allow for the 
identification of additional co-conspirators 
who would continue to operate and illegally 
traffic firearms to Mexican DTOs which are 
perpetrating 
armed 
violence 
along 
the 
Southwest Border.13 
1. COORDINATION WITH ATF 
In early September 2009, according to De-
partment e-mails, ATF and the Department 
of Justice’s Criminal Division began discus-
sions ‘‘to talk about ways CRM [Criminal Di-
vision] and ATF can coordinate on gun traf-
ficking 
and 
gang-related 
initiatives.’’ 27 
Early on in these discussions, Lanny Breuer, 
Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal 
Division, sent an attorney to help the U.S. 
Attorney’s Office in Arizona prosecute ATF 
cases. The first case chosen for prosecution 
was Operation Wide Receiver, a year-long 
ATF Phoenix Field Division investigation 
initiated in 2006, which involved several hun-
dred guns being walked. The U.S. Attorney’s 
Office in Arizona, objecting to the tactics 
used in Wide Receiver, had previously re-
fused to prosecute the case. 
According to James Trusty, a senior offi-
cial in the Criminal Division’s Gang Unit, in 
September 2009 Assistant Attorney General 
Breuer was ‘‘VERY interested in the Arizona 
gun trafficking case [Wide Receiver], and he 
is traveling out [to Arizona] around 9/21. 
Consequently, he asked us for a ‘briefing’ on 
that case before the 21st rolls around.’’ 28 The 
next day, according to Trusty, Breuer’s chief 
of staff ‘‘mentioned the case again, so there 
is clearly great attention/interest from the 
front office.’’ 29 
When the Criminal Division prosecutor ar-
rived in Arizona, she gave Trusty her impres-
sions of the case. Her e-mail stated: 
Case involves 300 to 500 guns. . . . It is my 
understanding that a lot of these guns 
‘‘walked’’. Whether some or all of that was 
intentional is not known.30 
Discussions between ATF and the Criminal 
Division regarding inter-departmental co-
ordination continued over the next few 
months. On December 3, 2009, the Acting 
ATF Director e-mailed Breuer about this co-
operation. He stated: 
Lanny: We have decided to take a little dif-
ferent approach with regard to seizures of 
multiple weapons in Mexico. Assuming the 
guns are traced, instead of working each 
trace almost independently of the other 
traces from the seizure, I want to coordinate 
and monitor the work on all of them collec-
tively as if the seizure was one case.31 
Breuer responded: 
We think this is a terrific idea and a great 
way to approach the investigations of these 
seizures. Our Gang Unit will be assigning an 
attorney to help you coordinate this effort.32 
The next day, December 9, 2009, the Acting 
ATF Director first learned about Fast and 
Furious and the large recovery of weapons 
that had already occurred.17 The following 
week, OSII briefed senior ATF officials about 
another large cache of Fast and Furious 
weapons that had been recovered in Mexico.18 
On January 5, 2010, OSII presented senior 
ATF officials with a summary of all of the 
weapons that could be linked to known straw 
purchasers in Fast and Furious. In just two 
months, these straw purchasers bought a 
total of 685 guns. This number raised the ire 
of several individuals in the room, who ex-
pressed concerns about the growing oper-
ation.19 
On March 5, 2010, ATF headquarters hosted 
a larger, more detailed briefing on Operation 
Fast and Furious. David Voth, the Group Su-
pervisor overseeing Fast and Furious, trav-
eled from Phoenix to give the presentation. 
He gave an extremely detailed synopsis of 
the status of the investigation, including the 
number of guns purchased, weapons seizures 
to date, money spent by straw purchasers, 
and organizational charts of the relation-
ships among straw purchasers and to mem-
bers of the Sinaloa drug cartel. At that 
point, the straw purchasers had bought 1,026 
weapons, costing nearly $650,000.20 
NATF’s Phoenix Field Division informed 
ATF headquarters of large weapons recov-
eries tracing back to Fast and Furious. The 
Phoenix Field Division had frequently for-
warded these updates directly to Deputy 
ATF Director Billy Hoover and Acting ATF 
Director Ken Melson.21 When Hoover learned 
about how large Fast and Furious had grown 
in March 2010, he finally ordered the develop-
ment of an exit strategy.22 This exit strat-
egy, something Hoover had never before re-
quested in any other case, was a timeline for 
ATF to wind down the case.23 
Though Hoover commissioned the exit 
strategy in March, he did not receive it until 
early May. The three-page document out-
lined a 30-, 60-, and 90-day strategy for wind-
ing down Fast and Furious and handing it 
over to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for pros-
ecution.24 
In July 2010, Acting Director Melson ex-
pressed concern about the number of weap-
ons flowing to Mexico,25 and in October 2010 
the Assistant Director for Field Operations, 
the number three official in ATF, expressed 
concern that ATF had not yet halted the 
straw purchasing activity in Fast and Furi-
ous.26 Despite these concerns, however, the 
U.S. Attorney’s Office continued to delay the 
indictments, and no one at ATF head-
quarters ordered the Phoenix Field Division 
to simply arrest the straw purchasers in 
order to take them off the street. The mem-
bers of the firearms trafficking ring were not 
arrested until two weapons from Fast and 
Furious were found at the murder scene of 
Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry. 
Kevin Carwile, Chief of the Gang Unit, as-
signed an attorney, Joe Cooley, to assist 
ATF, and Operation Fast and Furious was se-
lected as a recipient of this assistance. 
Shortly after his assignment, Cooley had to 
rearrange his holiday plans to attend a sig-
nificant briefing on Fast and Furious.33 
Cooley was assigned to Fast and Furious 
for the next three months. He advised the 
lead federal prosecutor, Emory Hurley, and 
received detailed briefings on operational de-
tails. Cooley, though, was not the only 
Criminal Division attorney involved with 
Fast and Furious was approved as an 
OCDETF case, and this designation resulted 
in new operational funding. Additionally, 
Fast and Furious became a prosecutor-led 
OCDETF Strike Force case, meaning that 
ATF would join with the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation, Drug Enforcement Adminis-
tration, Internal Revenue Service, and Im-
migrations and Customs Enforcement under 
the leadership of the U.S. Attorney’s Office 
for the District of Arizona. 
B. THE UNITED STATES ATTORNEY’S OFFICE 
FOR THE DISTRICT OF ARIZONA 
The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District 
of Arizona led the Fast and Furious OCDETF 
Strike Force. Although ATF was the lead 
law enforcement agency for Fast and Furi-
ous, its agents took direction from prosecu-
tors in the U.S. Attorney’s Office. The lead 
federal prosecutor for Fast and Furious was 
Assistant U.S. Attorney Emory Hurley, who 
played an integral role in the day-to-day, 
tactical management of the case.14 
Many ATF agents working on Operation 
Fast and Furious came to believe that some 
of the most basic law enforcement tech-
niques used to interdict weapons required 
the explicit approval of the U.S. Attorney’s 
Office, and specifically from Hurley. On nu-
merous occasions, Hurley and other federal 
prosecutors withheld this approval, to the 
mounting frustration of ATF agents.15 The 
U.S. Attorney’s Office chose not to use other 
available investigative tools common in gun 
trafficking cases, such as civil forfeitures 
and seizure warrants, during the seminal pe-
riods of Fast and Furious. 
The U.S. Attorney’s Office advised ATF 
that agents needed to meet unnecessarily 
strict evidentiary standards in order to 
speak with suspects, temporarily detain 
them, or interdict weapons. ATF’s reliance 
on this advice from the U.S. Attorney’s Of-
fice during Fast and Furious resulted in 
many lost opportunities to interdict weap-
ons. 
In addition to leading the Fast and Furious 
OCDETF task force, the U.S. Attorney’s Of-
fice was instrumental in preparing the wire-
tap applications that were submitted to the 
Justice 
Department’s 
Criminal 
Division. 
Federal prosecutors in Arizona filed at least 
six of these applications, each containing 
immense detail about operational tactics 
and specific information about straw pur-
chasers, in federal court after Department 
headquarters authorized them. 
C. ATF HEADQUARTERS 
Fast and Furious first came to the atten-
tion of ATF Headquarters on December 8, 
2009, just weeks after the case was officially 
opened in Phoenix. ATF’s Office of Strategic 
Information and Intelligence (OSII) briefed 
senior ATF personnel about the case on De-
cember 8, 2009, discussing in detail a large re-
covery of Fast and Furious weapons in Naco, 
Sonora, Mexico.16

H4180 
June 28, 2012 
Two Fast and Furious weapons were recov-
ered at the scene of his murder. Two days 
later, Associate Deputy Attorney General 
Brad Smith sent Grindler and four ODAG of-
ficials an e-mail detailing the circumstances 
of Terry’s murder and its connection to Fast 
and Furious.49 Smith attached a four-page 
summary of the Fast and Furious investiga-
tion. 
V. THE COMMITTEE’S OCTOBER 12, 2011, 
SUBPOENA 
TO 
ATTORNEY 
GENERAL 
HOLDER 
On October 12, 2011, the Committee issued 
a subpoena to Attorney General Eric Holder, 
demanding documents related to the Depart-
ment of Justice’s involvement with Oper-
ation Fast and Furious. The subpoena was 
issued following six months of constant re-
fusals by the Justice Department to cooper-
ate with the Committee’s investigation into 
Operation Fast and Furious. 
A. EVENTS LEADING UP TO THE SUBPOENA 
Fast and Furious during this time period. 
The head of the division, Lanny Breuer, met 
with ATF officials about the case, including 
Deputy Director Billy Hoover and Assistant 
Director for Field Operations Mark Chait.34 
Given the initial involvement of the Crimi-
nal Division with Fast and Furious in the 
early stages of the investigation, senior offi-
cials in Criminal Division should have been 
greatly alarmed about what they learned 
about the case. These officials should have 
halted the program, especially given their 
prior knowledge of gunwalking in Wide Re-
ceiver, which was run by the same leadership 
in the same ATF field division. 
On March 5, 2010, Cooley attended a brief-
ing about Fast and Furious. The detailed 
briefing highlighted the large number of 
weapons the gun trafficking ring had pur-
chased and discussed recoveries of those 
weapons in Mexico. According to Steve Mar-
tin, Deputy Assistant Director in ATF’s Of-
fice of Strategic Intelligence and Informa-
tion, everyone in the room knew the weap-
ons from Fast and Furious were being linked 
to a Mexican cartel.35 Two weeks later, in 
mid-March 2010, Carwile pulled Cooley off 
Fast and Furious, when the U.S. Attorney’s 
Office informed him that it had the case 
under control.36 
On March 16, 2011, Chairman Issa sent a 
letter to then-ATF Acting Director Ken 
Melson asking for information and docu-
ments pertaining to Operation Fast and Fu-
rious.50 Late in the afternoon of March 30, 
2011, the Department, on behalf of ATF and 
Melson, informed the Committee that it 
would not provide any documents pursuant 
to the letter. The Committee informed the 
Department it planned to issue a subpoena. 
On March 31, 2011, the Committee issued a 
subpoena to Ken Melson for the documents. 
On May 2, 2011, Committee staff reviewed 
documents the Department made available 
for in camera review at Department head-
quarters. Many of these documents con-
tained partial or full redactions. Following 
this review, Chairman Issa wrote to the De-
partment on May 5, 2011, asking the Depart-
ment to produce all documents responsive to 
the Committee’s subpoena forthwith.51 That 
same day, senior Department officials met 
with Committee staff and acknowledged 
‘‘there’s a there, there’’ regarding the legit-
imacy of the congressional inquiry into Fast 
and Furious. 
In spite of Chairman Issa’s May 5, 2011, let-
ter, during the two months following the 
issuance of the subpoena, the Department 
produced zero pages of non-public docu-
ments. On June 8, 2011, the Committee again 
wrote to the Department requesting com-
plete production of all documents by June 10, 
2011.52 The Department responded on June 10, 
2011, stating ‘‘complete production of all doc-
uments by June 10, 2011, . . . is not pos-
sible.’’ 53 At 7:49 p.m. that evening, just three 
days before a scheduled Committee hearing 
on the obligation of the Department of Jus-
tice to cooperate with congressional over-
sight, the Department finally produced its 
first non-public documents to the Com-
mittee, totaling 69 pages.54 
2. WIRETAPS 
At about the same time, senior lawyers in 
the Criminal Division authorized wiretap ap-
plications for Fast and Furious to be sub-
mitted to a federal judge. Fast and Furious 
involved the use of seven wiretaps between 
March and July of 2010. 
In a letter to Chairman Issa, the Deputy 
Attorney General acknowledged that the Of-
fice of Enforcement Operations (OEO), part 
of the Justice Department’s Criminal Divi-
sion, is ‘‘primarily responsible for the De-
partment’s 
statutory 
wiretap 
authoriza-
tions.’’ 37 According to the letter, lawyers in 
OEO review these wiretap packages to ensure 
that they ‘‘meet statutory requirements and 
DOJ policies.’’ 38 When OEO completes its re-
view of a wiretap package, federal law pro-
vides that the Attorney General or his des-
ignee—in practice, a Deputy Assistant Attor-
ney General in the Criminal Division—re-
views and authorizes it.39 Each wiretap pack-
age includes an affidavit which details the 
factual basis upon which the authorization is 
sought. Each application for Fast and Furi-
ous included a memorandum from Assistant 
Attorney General Breuer to Paul O’Brien, 
Director of OEO, authorizing the intercep-
tion application.40 
The Criminal Division’s approval of the 
wiretap applications in Fast and Furious vio-
lated Department of Justice policy. The core 
mission of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, 
Firearms, and Explosives is to ‘‘protect[ ] 
our communities from . . . the illegal use 
and trafficking of firearms.’’ 41 
The wiretap applications document the ex-
tensive involvement of the Criminal Division 
in Fast and Furious. These applications were 
Over the next six weeks, through July 21, 
2011, the Department produced an additional 
1,286 pages of documents. The Department 
produced no additional documents until Sep-
tember 1, 2011, when it produced 193 pages of 
constructed from raw data contained in hun-
dreds of Reports of Investigation (ROI); the 
Department of Justice failed to produce any 
of these ROI in response to the Committee’s 
subpoena. The Criminal Division authorized 
Fast and Furious wiretap applications on 
March 10, 2010; April 15, 2010; May 6, 2010; 
May 14, 2010; June 1, 2010; and July 1, 2010. 
Deputy Assistant Attorney General Jason 
Weinstein, Deputy Assistant Attorney Gen-
eral Kenneth Blanco, and Deputy Assistant 
Attorney General John Keeney signed these 
applications on behalf of Assistant Attorney 
General Lanny Breuer. 
E. THE OFFICE OF THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY 
GENERAL 
The Office of the Deputy Attorney General 
(ODAG) maintained close involvement in Op-
eration Fast and Furious. In the Justice De-
partment, ATF reports to the Deputy Attor-
ney General (DAG).42 In practice, an official 
in the Office of the Deputy Attorney General 
is responsible for managing the ATF port-
folio. This official monitors the operations of 
ATF, and raises potential ATF issues to the 
attention of the DAG.43 During the pendency 
of Fast and Furious, this official was Asso-
ciate 
Deputy 
Attorney 
General 
Edward 
Siskel. 
Officials in ODAG became familiar with 
Fast and Furious as early as March 2010. On 
March 12, 2010, Siskel and then-Acting DAG 
Gary Grindler received an extensive briefing 
on Fast and Furious during a monthly meet-
ing with the ATF’s Acting Director and Dep-
uty 
Director. 
This 
briefing 
presented 
Grindler with overwhelming evidence of ille-
gal straw purchasing during Fast and Furi-
ous. The presentation included a chart of the 
names of the straw purchasers, 31 in all, and 
the number of weapons they had acquired to 
date, 1,026.44 Three of these straw purchasers 
had already purchased over 100 weapons 
each, with one straw purchaser having al-
ready acquired over 300 weapons. During this 
briefing, Grindler learned that buyers had 
paid cash for every single gun.45 
A map of Mexico detailed locations of re-
coveries of weapons purchased through Fast 
and 
Furious, 
including 
some 
at 
crime 
scenes.46 The briefing also covered the use of 
stash houses where weapons bought during 
Fast and Furious were stored before being 
transported to Mexico. Grindler learned of 
some of the unique investigative techniques 
ATF was using during Fast and Furious.47 
Despite receiving all of this information, 
then-Deputy 
Attorney 
General 
Gary 
Grindler did not order Fast and Furious to be 
shut down, nor did he follow-up with ATF or 
his staff about the investigation. 
Throughout the summer of 2010, ATF offi-
cials remained in close contact with their 
ODAG supervisors regarding Fast and Furi-
ous. Fast and Furious was a topic in each of 
the monthly meetings between ATF and the 
DAG. ATF apprised Ed Siskel of significant 
recoveries of Fast and Furious weapons, as 
well as of notable progress in the investiga-
tion, and Siskel indicated to ATF that he 
was monitoring it.48 In mid-December 2010, 
after Fast and Furious had been ongoing for 
over a year, Grindler received more details 
about the program. On December 15, 2010, 
Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry was killed.

among 
Department 
compo-
nents, the Department’s cooperation with 
Congress, and FBI documents requested in 
the July 11, 2011, letter to FBI Director 
Mueller.65 To date, the Department has not 
responded to this letter. 
The Department wrote to Chairman Issa 
on October 11, 2011, stating it had ‘‘substan-
tially concluded [its] efforts to respond to 
the Committee requests set forth in the sub-
poena and the letter of June 8th.’’ 66 The let-
ter further stated: 
[O]ther documents have not been produced 
or made available for these same reasons be-
cause neither redacting them nor making 
them available for review (as opposed to pro-
duction) was sufficient to address our con-
cerns. Our disclosure of the vast majority of 
the withheld material is prohibited by stat-
ute. These records pertain to matters occur-
ring before a grand jury, as well as investiga-
tive activities under seal or the disclosure of 
which is prohibited by law . . . we also have 
not disclosed certain confidential investiga-
tive and prosecutorial documents, the disclo-
sure of which would, in our judgment, com-
promise the pending criminal investigations 
and prosecution. These include core inves-
tigative and prosecutorial material, such as 
Reports of Investigation and drafts of court 
filings. 
Finally . . . we have also withheld internal 
communications that were generated in the 
course of the Department’s effort to respond 
to congressional and media inquiries about 
Operation Fast and Furious. These records 
were created in 2011, well after the comple-
tion of the investigative portion of Operation 
Fast and Furious that the Committee has 
been reviewing and after the charging deci-
sions reflected in the January 25, 2011, in-
dictments. Thus, they were not part of the 
communications regarding the development 
and implementation of the strategy deci-
sions that have not been the focus of the 
Committee’s inquiry . . . Disclosure would 
have a chilling effect on agency officials’ de-
liberations about how to respond to inquiries 
from Congress or the media. Such a chill on 
internal communications would interfere 
with our ability to respond as effectively and 
efficiently as possible to congressional over-
sight requests.67 
documents.55 On September 30, 2011, the De-
partment produced 97 pages of documents.56 
On October 11, 2011, the Department pro-
duced 56 pages of documents.57 
Early in the investigation, the Committee 
received hundreds of pertinent documents 
from whistleblowers. Many of the documents 
the whistleblowers provided were not among 
the 2,050 pages that the Department had pro-
duced by October 11, 2011, demonstrating 
that the Department was withholding mate-
rials responsive to the subpoena. 
The Committee requested additional docu-
ments from the Department as the investiga-
tion proceeded during the summer of 2011. On 
July 11, 2011, Chairman Issa and Senator 
Grassley wrote to the Attorney General re-
questing documents from twelve people in 
Justice Department headquarters pertaining 
to Fast and Furious.58 The Justice Depart-
ment first responded to this letter on Octo-
ber 31, 2011, nearly four months later.59 
On July 11, 2011, Chairman Issa and Sen-
ator Grassley sent a letter to the FBI re-
questing documents relating to the FBI’s 
role in the Fast and Furious OCDETF inves-
tigation.60 The letter requested information 
and documents pertaining to paid FBI in-
formants who were the target of the Fast 
and Furious investigation. The FBI never 
produced any of the documents requested in 
this letter. 
On July 15, 2011, Chairman Issa and Sen-
ator Grassley sent a letter to the DEA re-
questing documents pertaining to another 
target of the Fast and Furious investiga-
tion.61 The DEA was aware of this target be-
fore Fast and Furious became an OCDETF 
case, a fact that raises serious questions 
about the lack of information-sharing among 
Department components. Though DEA re-
sponded to the letter on July 22, 2011, it, too, 
did not provide any of the requested docu-
ments.62 
On September 1, 2011, Chairman Issa and 
Senator Grassley wrote to the Acting U.S. 
Attorney in Arizona requesting documents 
and communications pertaining to Fast and 
Furious.63 As the office responsible for lead-
ing Fast and Furious, the Arizona U.S. At-
torney’s Office possesses a large volume of 
documents relevant to the Committee’s in-
vestigation. The Department of Justice, on 
behalf of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the 
District of Arizona, did not respond to this 
letter until December 6, 2011, the eve of the 
Attorney General’s testimony before the 
House Judiciary Committee.64 
On September 27, 2011, Chairman Issa and 
Senator Grassley sent a letter to the Attor-
ney General raising questions about informa-
The following day, on October 12, 2011, 
after the Department announced its inten-
tion to cease producing documents respon-
sive to the Committee’s March 31, 2011, sub-
poena to Melson, the Committee issued a 
subpoena to Attorney General Eric Holder 
demanding documents relating to Fast and 
Furious. 
B. SUBPOENA SCHEDULE REQUESTS 
In the weeks following the issuance of the 
subpoena, Committee staff worked closely 
with Department lawyers to provide clari-
fications about subpoena categories, and to 
assist the Department in prioritizing docu-
ments for production. Committee and De-
partment staff engaged in discussions span-
ning several weeks to enable the Department 
to better understand what the Committee 
was specifically seeking. During these con-
versations, the Committee clearly articu-
lated its investigative priorities as reflected 
in the subpoena schedule. The Department 
memorialized these priorities with speci-
ficity in an October 31, 2011, e-mail from the 
Office of Legislative Affairs.68 
Despite the Department’s acknowledge-
ment that it understands what the Com-
mittee was seeking, it has yet to provide a 
single document for 11 out of the 22 cat-
egories contained in the subpoena schedule. 
The Department has not adequately com-
plied with the Committee’s subpoena, and it 
has unequivocally stated its refusal to com-
ply with entire categories of the subpoena al-
together. In a letter to Chairman Issa on 
May 15, 2012, the Department stated that it 
had delivered or made available for review 
documents responsive to 13 of the 22 cat-
egories of the subpoena.69 
A review of each of the 22 schedule cat-
egories in the subpoena reflects the Depart-
ment’s clear understanding of the documents 
sought by the Committee for each category. 
Below is a listing of each category of the 
subpoena schedule, followed by what the De-
partment has explained is its understanding 
of what the Committee is seeking for each 
category. 
1. All communications referring or relating 
to Operation Fast and Furious, the Jacob 
Chambers case, or any Organized Crime Drug 
Enforcement Task Force (OCDETF) firearms 
trafficking case based in Phoenix, Arizona,

Case Unit, Criminal Division; 
o. Joseph Cooley, Criminal Fraud Section,

Department Response: In late October 2011, 
the Department acknowledged that it had 
‘‘already begun searches of some of the 
custodians listed here relating to Fast and 
Furious, such as in response to the Chair-
man’s letter of 7/11/11.’’ 70 Still, it has pro-
duced no documents since the issuance of the 
subpoena pursuant to subpoena categories 
1(a), 1(b), 1(g), 1(i), and 1(k), only two docu-
ments pursuant to subpoena category 1(d), 
and very few documents pursuant to sub-
poena category 1(j) and 1(l).

knowledged that the Committee identified

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4182 
June 28, 2012 
news article stated that ‘‘[n]obody was more 
astonished to learn of the case than Zapata’s 
parents, who didn’t know that [the defend-
ant] had been arrested or linked to their 
son’s murder.’’ 77 Press accounts alleged that 
the defendant had been ‘‘under ATF surveil-
lance for at least six months before a rifle he 
trafficked was used in Zapata’s murder’’—a 
situation similar to what took place during 
Fast and Furious.78 Despite this revelation, 
the Department failed to produce any docu-
ments responsive to this subpoena category. 
7. All communications to or from William 
Newell, former Special Agent-in-Charge for 
ATF’s Phoenix Field Division, between: 
a. December 14, 2010 to January 25, 2011; 
and, 
b. March 16, 2009 to March 19, 2009. 
Department Response: The Department has 
not produced any documents responsive to 
subpoena category 7(b), despite its under-
standing that the Committee sought docu-
ments pertaining ‘‘to communications with 
[Executive Office of the President] staff re-
garding gun control policy’’ within a specific 
and narrow timeframe.79
The Department 
has not informed the Committee that no doc-
uments exist responsive to this schedule 
number. 
8. All Reports of Investigation (ROIs) re-
lated to Operation Fast and Furious or ATF 
Case Number 785115–10–0004. 
Department 
Response: 
Department 
rep-
resentatives contended that this subpoena 
category ‘‘presents some significant issues 
for’’ the Department due to current and po-
tential future indictments.80
The Depart-
ment has not produced any documents re-
sponsive to this subpoena category. The De-
partment has not informed the Committee 
that no documents exist responsive to this 
schedule number. 
9. All communications between and among 
Matt Axelrod, Kenneth Melson, and William 
Hoover referring or relating to ROIs identi-
fied pursuant to Paragraph 8. 
Department Response: The Department ac-
knowledged its understanding that this re-
quest specifically pertained to ‘‘emails Ken 
sent to Matt and Billy, expressing concerns, 
perhaps in March 2011, [that] are core to [the 
Committee’s] 
work, 
and 
we’ll 
look 
at 
those.’’ 81 Still, it has produced no documents 
pursuant to this subpoena category. The De-
partment has not informed the Committee 
that no documents exist responsive to this 
schedule number. 
10. All documents and communications be-
tween and among former U.S. Attorney Den-
nis Burke, Attorney General Eric Holder, 
Jr., former Acting Deputy Attorney General 
Gary Grindler, Deputy Attorney General 
James Cole, Assistant Attorney General 
Lanny Breuer, and Deputy Assistant Attor-
ney General Jason Weinstein referring or re-
lating to Operation Fast and Furious or any 
OCDETF case originating in Arizona. 
Department Response: The Department has 
produced some documents responsive to this 
subpoena category. 
A complete production of these documents 
is crucial to allow Congress to understand 
how senior Department officials came to 
know that the February 4, 2011, letter to 
Senator Grassley was false, why it took so 
long for the Department to withdraw the let-
ter despite months of congressional pressure 
to do so, and why the Department obstructed 
these documents.71 Though the Department 
has stated it has produced documents pursu-
ant to this subpoena category, the Com-
mittee has not found any documents pro-
duced by the Department responsive to this 
subpoena category.72 
3. All communications between DOJ em-
ployees and Executive Office of the President 
employees referring or relating to the Presi-
dent’s March 22, 2011, interview with Jorge 
Ramos of Univision. 
Department Response: The Department rep-
resented that it would ‘‘check on commu-
nications with WH Press Office in the time 
period preceding the President’s 3/22/11 inter-
view,’’ and that it had identified the most 
likely 
custodians 
of 
those 
documents.73 
Nonetheless, it has produced no documents 
responsive to this subpoena category. The 
Department has not informed the Committee 
that no documents exist responsive to this 
schedule number. 
4. All documents and communications re-
ferring or relating to any instances prior to 
February 4, 2011, where the Bureau of Alco-
hol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) 
failed to interdict weapons that had been il-
legally purchased or transferred. 
Department Response: The Department has 
produced some documents responsive to this 
subpoena category. 
5. All documents and communications re-
ferring or relating to any instances prior to 
February 4, 2011, where ATF broke off sur-
veillance of weapons and subsequently be-
came aware that those weapons entered Mex-
ico. 
Department Response: The Department has 
produced documents responsive to this sub-
poena category. 
Most of the responsive documents the De-
partment has produced pursuant to the sub-
poena pertain to categories 4 and 5 and re-
late to earlier cases the Department has de-
scribed as involving gunwalking. The De-
partment produced these documents strate-
gically, advancing its own narrative about 
why Fast and Furious was neither an iso-
lated nor a unique program. It has attempted 
to accomplish this objective by simulta-
neously producing documents to the media 
and the Committee. 
6. All documents and communications re-
ferring or relating to the murder of Immigra-
tions and Customs Enforcement Agent Jaime 
Zapata, including, but not limited to, docu-
ments 
and 
communications 
regarding 
Zapata’s mission when he was murdered, 
Form for Reporting Information That May 
Become Testimony (FD–302), photographs of 
the crime scene, and investigative reports 
prepared by the FBI. 
Department 
Response: 
The 
Department 
‘‘understand[s] that the Zapata family has 
complained that they’ve been ‘kept in the 
dark’ about this matter’’ which necessitated 
this subpoena category.74 The Department 
‘‘conferred with the U.S. Attorney’s Office 
. . . which we hope will be helpful to them 
and perhaps address the concerns that are 
the basis of this item.’’ 75 Though the Depart-
ment has stated it has produced documents 
pursuant to this subpoena category, the 
Committee has not found any documents 
produced by the Department responsive to 
this subpoena category.76 
In late February 2012, press accounts re-
vealed that prosecutors had recently sen-
tenced a second individual in relation to the 
murder of Immigration and Customs En-
forcement (ICE) Agent Jaime Zapata. One 
the congressional investigation for nearly a 
year. These documents will show the reac-
tions of top officials when confronted with 
evidence about gunwalking in Fast and Furi-
ous. The documents will also show whether 
these officials knew about, or were surprised 
to learn of, the gunwalking. Additionally, 
these documents will reveal the identities of 
Department officials who orchestrated var-
ious forms of retaliation against the whistle-
blowers. 
11. All communications sent or received be-
tween: 
a. December 16, 2009 and December 18, 2009; 
and, 
b. March 9, 2011, and March 14, 2011, to or 
from the following individuals: 
i. Emory Hurley, Assistant U.S. Attorney, 
Office of the U.S. Attorney for the District of 
Arizona; 
ii. Michael Morrissey, Assistant U.S. At-
torney, Office of the U.S. Attorney for the 
District of Arizona; 
iii. Patrick Cunningham, Chief, Criminal 
Division, Office of the U.S. Attorney for the 
District of Arizona; 
iv. David Voth, Group Supervisor, ATF; 
and, 
v. Hope MacAllister, Special Agent, ATF. 
Department Response: The Department ac-
knowledged that it ‘‘will first search these 
custodians for records re a) the Howard 
meeting in 12/09; and b) the ROI or memo 
that was written during this time period re-
lating to the Howard mtng in 12/09.’’ 82 Al-
though the Department has produced docu-
ments that are purportedly responsive to 
this category, these documents do not per-
tain to the subject matter that the Depart-
ment understands that the Committee is 
seeking. 
12. All communications sent or received be-
tween December 15, 2010, and December 17, 
2010, to or from the following individuals in 
the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of 
Arizona: 
a. Dennis Burke, former United States At-
torney; 
b. Emory Hurley, Assistant United States 
Attorney; 
c. Michael Morrissey, Assistant United 
States Attorney; and, 
d. Patrick Cunningham, Chief of the Crimi-
nal Division. 
Department Response: The Department un-
derstood that the Committee’s ‘‘primary in-
terest here is in the communications during 
this time period that relate to the Terry 
death and, per our conversation, we will 
start with those.’’ 83 Although the Depart-
ment has produced some documents respon-
sive to this subpoena category, it has not 
represented that it has produced all respon-
sive documents in this category. 
13. All communications sent or received be-
tween August 7, 2009, and March 19, 2011, be-
tween and among former Ambassador to 
Mexico Carlos Pascual; Assistant Attorney 
General Lanny Breuer; and Deputy Assistant 
Attorney General Bruce Swartz. 
Department Response: The Department ac-
knowledged that it ‘‘understand[s] the Com-
mittee’s focus here is Firearms Trafficking 
issues along the SW Border, not limited to 
Fast & Furious.’’ 84 The Department has pro-
duced some documents responsive to this 
subpoena category. 
14. All communications sent or received be-
tween August 7, 2009, and March 19, 2011, be-
tween and among former Ambassador to 
Mexico Carlos Pascual and any Department 
of Justice employee based in Mexico City re-
ferring or relating to firearms trafficking

June 28, 2012 
ecutive Branch agency. Unfortunately, the 
Department’s actions have not matched its 
rhetoric. Instead, it has chosen to prolong 
the investigation and impugn the motives of 
the Committee. A statement the Attorney 
General made at the February 2, 2012, hear-
ing was emblematic of the Department’s pos-
ture with respect to the investigation: 
But I also think that if we are going to 
really get ahead here, if we are really going 
to make some progress, we need to put aside 
the political gotcha games in an election 
year and focus on matters that are ex-
tremely serious.95 
This attitude with respect to a legitimate 
congressional inquiry has permeated the De-
partment’s ranks. Had the Department dem-
onstrated a willingness to cooperate with 
this investigation from the outset—instead 
of attempting to cover up its own internal 
mismanagement—this investigation likely 
would have concluded well before the elec-
tion year even began. The Department has 
intentionally 
withheld 
documents 
for 
months, only to release a selected few on the 
eve of the testimony of Department offi-
cials.96
The Department has impeded the 
ability of a co-equal branch of government to 
perform its constitutional duty to conduct 
Executive Branch oversight. By any meas-
ure, it has obstructed and slowed the Com-
mittee’s work. 
The Committee has been unfailingly pa-
tient in working with Department represent-
atives to obtain information the Committee 
requires to complete its investigation. The 
Department’s progress has been unaccept-
ably slow in responding to the October 12, 
2011, subpoena issued to the Attorney Gen-
eral. Complying with the Committee’s sub-
poena is not optional. Indeed, the failure to 
produce documents pursuant to a congres-
sional subpoena is a violation of federal 
law.97 Because the Department has not cited 
any legal authority as the basis for with-
holding documents pursuant to the subpoena 
its efforts to accommodate the Committee’s 
constitutional obligation to conduct over-
sight of the Executive Branch are incom-
plete. 
1. IN CAMERA REVIEWS 
In an attempt to accommodate the Justice 
Department’s interests, Committee staff has 
viewed documents responsive to the sub-
poena that the Department has identified as 
sensitive in camera at Department head-
quarters. Committee staff has visited the De-
partment on April 12, May 4, June 17, Octo-
ber 12, and November 3, 2011, as well as on 
January 30 and February 27, 2012 to view 
these documents. Many of the documents 
made available for in camera review, how-
ever, have been repetitive in nature. Many 
other documents seemingly do not contain 
any sensitive parts that require them to be 
viewed in camera. Other documents are alto-
gether non-responsive to the subpoena. 
Committee staff has spent dozens of hours 
at Department headquarters reviewing these 
category. The Department has not informed 
the Committee that no documents exist re-
sponsive to this schedule number. 
19. All documents and communications be-
tween and among FBI employees in Arizona 
and the FBI Laboratory, including but not 
limited to employees in the Firearms/ 
Toolmark Unit, referring or relating to the 
firearms recovered during the course of the 
investigation of Brian Terry’s death. 
Department Response: The Department’s un-
derstanding was that ‘‘[the Committee’s] 
focus here is how evidence was tagged at the 
scene of Agent Terry’s murder, how evidence 
was processed, how the FBI ballistics report 
was prepared and what it means.’’ 90 Despite 
this clear understanding, the Department 
has produced no documents responsive to 
this subpoena category. The Department has 
not informed the Committee that no docu-
ments exist responsive to this schedule num-
ber. 
20. All agendas, meeting notes, meeting 
minutes, and follow-up reports for the Attor-
ney General’s Advisory Committee of U.S. 
Attorneys between March 1, 2009, and July 
31, 2011, referring or relating to Operation 
Fast and Furious. 
Department Response: This category asks 
for documents from the Attorney General’s 
Advisory Committee within a clearly speci-
fied date range. Despite the fact that the De-
partment has acknowledged this category 
‘‘is clear,’’ the Department has produced no 
documents responsive to this subpoena cat-
egory.91 The Department has not informed 
the Committee that no documents exist re-
sponsive to this schedule number. 
21. All weekly reports and memoranda for 
the Attorney General, either directly or 
through the Deputy Attorney General, from 
any employee in the Criminal Division, ATF, 
DEA, FBI, or the National Drug Intelligence 
Center created between November 1, 2009 and 
September 30, 2011. 
Department Response: This category asks 
for weekly reports and memoranda to the 
Attorney General from five different Depart-
ment components ‘‘regarding ATF cases re 
firearms trafficking.’’ 92 The Department has 
produced some documents responsive to this 
subpoena category. 
22. All surveillance tapes recorded by pole 
cameras inside the Lone Wolf Trading Co. 
store between 12:00 a.m. on October 3, 2010, 
and 12:00 a.m. on October 7, 2010. 
Department Response: This category asks 
for all ATF surveillance tapes from Lone 
Wolf Trading Company between two speci-
fied dates in October 2010. Both the Com-
mittee and the Department ‘‘understand a 
break-in occurred’’ at that time.93 The De-
partment has produced no documents respon-
sive to this subpoena category. The Depart-
ment has not informed the Committee that 
no documents exist responsive to this sched-
ule number. 
C. ATTEMPTS OF ACCOMMODATION BY THE COM-
MITTEE, LACK OF COMPLIANCE BY THE JUS-
TICE DEPARTMENT 
In public statements, the Department has 
maintained that it remains committed to 
‘‘work[ing] to accommodate the Committee’s 
legitimate oversight needs.’’ 94 The Depart-
ment, however, believes it is the sole arbiter 
of what is ‘‘legitimate.’’ In turn, the Com-
mittee has gone to great lengths to accom-
modate the Department’s interests as an Ex-
any firearms trafficking case based in Ari-
zona, or any visits by Assistant Attorney 
General Lanny Breuer to Mexico. 
Department Response: The Department has 
produced only a handful of pages responsive 
to this subpoena category, even though it 
‘‘understand[s] that [the Committee] wants 
[the Department] to approach this effort 
with efficiency.’’ 85 Despite the Committee’s 
request for an efficient effort, the Depart-
ment produced a key document regarding 
Attorney General Lanny Breuer three and a 
half months after the subpoena was issued, 
after several previous document productions, 
and long after Breuer testified before Con-
gress and could be questioned about the doc-
ument. Given the importance of the contents 
of the document and the request for an effi-
cient effort on the part of the Department in 
this subpoena category, it is inconceivable 
that the Department did not discover this 
document months prior to its production. 
The Department’s actions suggest that it 
kept this document hidden for strategic and 
public relations reasons. 
15. Any FD–302 relating to targets, sus-
pects, defendants, or their associates, bosses, 
or financiers in the Fast and Furious inves-
tigation, including but not limited to any 
FD–302s 
ATF 
Special 
Agent 
Hope 
MacAllister provided to ATF leadership dur-
ing the calendar year 2011. 
Department 
Response: 
The 
Department 
‘‘understand[s] that [the Committee’s] pri-
mary focus here is the 5 FBI 302s that were 
provided to SA MacAllister, which she later 
gave to Messrs. Hoover and Melson.’’ 86 De-
spite the specificity of this document re-
quest, the Department has not produced any 
documents responsive to this schedule num-
ber. The Department has not informed the 
Committee that no documents exist respon-
sive to this schedule number. 
16. Any investigative reports prepared by 
the FBI or Drug Enforcement Administra-
tion (DEA) referring or relating to targets, 
suspects, or defendants in the Fast and Furi-
ous case. 
Department Response: The Department was 
‘‘uncertain about the volume here,’’ regard-
ing the amount of documents, and pledged to 
‘‘work[ ] on this [with] DEA and FBI.’’ 87 De-
spite this pledge, it has produced no docu-
ments responsive to this subpoena category. 
The Department has not informed the Com-
mittee that no documents exist responsive to 
this schedule number. 
17. Any investigative reports prepared by 
the FBI or DEA relating to the individuals 
described to Committee staff at the October 
5, 2011, briefing at Justice Department head-
quarters as Target Number 1 and Target 
Number 2. 
Department Response: The Department ac-
knowledged that it ‘‘think[s] we understand 
this item.’’ 88 Despite this understanding, it 
has produced no documents responsive to 
this subpoena category. The Department has 
not informed the Committee that no docu-
ments exist responsive to this schedule num-
ber. 
18. All documents and communications in 
the possession, custody or control of the 
DEA referring or relating to Manuel Fabian 
Celis-Acosta. 
Department 
Response: 
The 
Department 
agreed to ‘‘start with records regarding in-
formation that DEA shared with ATF about 
Acosta, which we understand to be the focus 
of your interest in this item.’’ 89 Despite this 
understanding, the Department has produced 
no documents responsive to this subpoena

(Statement of Hon. Eric H. Holder, Jr., Att’y Gen. of 
the U.S.). 
95 Id. 
96 On Friday January 27, 2012, just days before the 
Attorney General testified before Congress, docu-
ments were delivered to the Senate Judiciary Com-
mittee so late in the evening that a disc of files had 
to be slipped under the door. This is not only an ex-
treme inconvenience for congressional staff but also 
deprives staff of the ability to review the materials 
in a timely manner.

Every person who having been summoned as a wit-
ness by the authority of either House of Congress to 
give testimony or to produce papers upon any mat-

26, 2011, report entitled The Department of 
Justice’s Operation Fast and Furious: Fueling 
Cartel Violence, and gave the Department an 
opportunity to suggest its own redactions 
before 
the 
documents 
became 
public.101 
These actions are consistent with the Com-
mittee’s willingness to accommodate the De-
partment’s interests. 
documents. In addition, the Department has 
identified hundreds of other sensitive docu-
ments responsive to the subpoena, which it 
refuses to make available even for in camera 
review, instead withholding them from the 
Committee altogether. The Committee has 
made these accommodations to the Depart-
ment at the expense of not being able to 
make these documents available for review 
by Committee Members. 
3. PRIVILEGE LOG 
Mindful of the Justice Department’s pre-
rogatives as an Executive Branch agency, 
the Committee has offered the opportunity 
for the Department to prepare a privilege log 
of documents responsive to the subpoena but 
withheld from production. A privilege log 
would outline the documents withheld and 
the specific grounds for withholding. Such a 
log would serve as the basis for negotiation 
between the Committee and the Department 
about prioritizing the documents for poten-
tial production. 
On January 31, 2012, Chairman Issa wrote 
to the Attorney General. He said: 
Should you choose to continue to withhold 
documents pursuant to the subpoena, you 
must create a detailed privilege log explain-
ing why the Department is refusing to 
produce each document. If the Department 
continues to obstruct the congressional in-
quiry by not providing documents and infor-
mation, this Committee will have no alter-
native but to move forward with proceedings 
to hold you in contempt of Congress.102 
stances in which the Justice Department has 
openly acknowledged it would not comply 
with the Committee’s requests. These pro-
nouncements began with the March 31, 2011, 
subpoena to the former Acting ATF Direc-
tor, continued through the Committee’s Oc-
tober 12, 2011, subpoena to the Attorney Gen-
eral, and persist to this day. 
(a) March 31, 2011, Subpoena 
On March 16, 2011, Chairman Issa sent a 
letter to the then-Acting ATF Director re-
questing documents about Fast and Furi-
ous.104 As part of this request, Chairman Issa 
asked for a ‘‘list of individuals responsible 
for authorizing the decision to ‘walk’ guns to 
Mexico in order to follow them and capture 
a ‘bigger fish.’ ’’ 105
On the afternoon of 
March 30, 2011, the deadline given in Chair-
man Issa’s letter, Department staff partici-
pated in a conference call with Committee 
staff. During that call, Department staff ex-
pressed a lack of understanding over the 
meaning of the word ‘‘list.’’ 106 Department 
officials further informed Committee staff 
that the Department would not produce doc-
uments by the deadline and were uncertain 
when they would produce documents in the 
future. Committee staff understood this re-
sponse to mean the Department did not in-
tend to cooperate with the Committee’s in-
vestigation. 
The next day Chairman Issa authorized a 
subpoena for the Acting ATF Director. The 
following day, the Department wrote to 
Chairman Issa. Assistant Attorney General 
Ronald Weich wrote: 
On February 14, 2012, Chairman Issa again 
wrote to the Attorney General. He said: 
As you know, the Department has been 
working with the Committee to provide doc-
uments responsive to its March 16 request to 
the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms 
and Explosives. Yesterday, we informed 
Committee staff that we intended to produce 
a number of responsive documents within 
the next week. As we explained, there are 
some documents that we would be unable to 
provide without compromising the Depart-
ment’s ongoing criminal investigation into 
the death of Agent Brian Terry as well as 
other investigations and prosecutions, but 
we would seek to work productively with the 
Committee to find other ways to be respon-
sive to its needs.107 
We cannot wait any longer for the Depart-
ment’s cooperation. As such please specify a 
date by which you expected the Department 
to produce all documents responsive to the 
subpoena. In addition, please specify a De-
partment representative who will interface 
with the Committee for production purposes 
. . . This person’s primary responsibility 
should be to identify for the Committee all 
documents the Department has determined 
to be responsive to the subpoena but is refus-
ing to produce, and should provide a privi-
lege log of the documents delineating why 
each one is being withheld from Congress. 
Please direct this individual to produce this 
log 
to 
the 
Committee 
without 
further 
delay.103 
Despite the Department’s stated intention 
to produce documents within the next week, 
it produced no documents for over two 
months, until June 10, 2011. In the interim, 
the Department made little effort to work 
with the Committee to define the scope of 
the documents required by the subpoena. 
On April 8, 2011, the Department wrote to 
Chairman Issa to inform the Committee that 
it had located documents responsive to the 
subpoena. Assistant Attorney General Weich 
wrote that the Department did not plan to 
share many of these materials with the Com-
mittee. His letter stated: 
On several occasions, Committee staff has 
asked the Department to provide such a 
privilege log, including a listing, category- 
by-category, of documents the Department 
has located pursuant to the subpoena and the 
reason the Department will not produce 
those documents. Despite these requests, 
however, the Department has neither pro-
duced a privilege log nor responded to this 
aspect of Chairman Issa’s letters of January 
31, 2012, and February 14, 2012. 
The Department has not informed the 
Committee that it has been unable to locate 
certain documents. This suggests that the 
Department is not producing responsive doc-
uments in its possession. Since the Depart-
ment will not produce a privilege log, it has 
failed to make a good faith effort to accom-
modate the Committee’s legitimate over-
sight interests. 
4. ASSERTIONS OF NON-COMPLIANCE 
The Committee’s investigation into Oper-
ation Fast and Furious is replete with in-
To date, our search has located several law 
enforcement sensitive documents responsive 
to the requests in your letter and the sub-
poena. We have substantial confidentiality 
interests in these documents because they 
contain information about ATF strategies 
and procedures that could be used by individ-
uals seeking to evade our law enforcement 
efforts. We are prepared to make these docu-
ments, with some redactions, available for 
review by Committee staff at the Depart-
ment. They will bear redactions to protect 
2. REDACTED DOCUMENTS 
The Department has redacted varying por-
tions of many of the documents it has pro-
duced. These redactions purportedly protect 
ongoing criminal investigations and prosecu-
tions, as well as other sensitive data. The 
Department has so heavily redacted some 
documents produced to Congress that they 
are unintelligible. There appears to be no ob-
jective, consistent criteria delineating why 
some documents were redacted, only pro-
vided in camera, or withheld entirely. 
On the evening of May 2, 2011, Department 
of Justice representatives notified the Com-
mittee that the Department was planning to 
make approximately 400 pages of documents 
available for an in camera review at its head-
quarters.98 Committee staff went to review 
those documents on May 4, 2011, only to dis-
cover they were partially, or in some cases 
almost completely, redacted. Since these 
documents were only made available pursu-
ant to Committee’s first subpoena and only 
on an in camera basis, redactions were inap-
propriate and unnecessary. 
On June 14, 2011, the Department produced 
65 pages of documents to the Committee in a 
production labeled ‘‘Batch 4.’’ 99 Of these 65 
pages, every single one was at least partially 
redacted, 44 were completely redacted, and 61 
had redactions covering more than half of 
the page. 
On July 18, 2011, after more than a month 
of discussions between Committee and De-
partment staff, the Department finally in-
cluded a redaction code that identifies the 
reason for each redaction within a docu-
ment.100 While the Department has used this 
redaction code in subsequent document pro-
ductions to the Committee, documents pro-
duced and redacted prior to July 18, 2011, do 
not have the benefit of associated redaction 
codes for each redaction. 
The Department has over-redacted certain 
documents. The Committee has obtained 
many of these documents through whistle-
blowers and has compared some of them with 
those produced by the Department. In some 
instances, the Department redacted more 
text than necessary, making it unnecessarily 
difficult and sometimes impossible for the 
Committee, absent the documents provided 
by whistleblowers, to investigate decisions 
made by Department officials. 
Further, any documents made available 
pursuant to the Committee’s subpoenas must 
not have any redactions. To fully and prop-
erly investigate the decisions made by De-
partment officials during Fast and Furious, 
the Committee requires access to documents 
in their entirety. The Department has not 
complied with this requirement. 
The Committee does recognize the impor-
tance of privacy interests and other legiti-
mate reasons the Department has for redact-
ing portions of documents produced to the 
Committee. The Committee has attempted 
to accommodate the Department’s stated 
concerns related to documents it believes are 
sensitive. The Committee intended to release 
230 pages of documents in support of its July 
98 Letter from Ass’t Att’y Gen. Ronald Weich to 
Chairman Darrell Issa (May 2, 2011).

tively and efficiently as possible to congres-
sional oversight requests.116 
you say touch on Operation Fast and Furi-
ous. Chairman Issa’s staff previously raised 
this issue with representatives of the Depart-
ment and it is my understanding that discus-
sions about whether and how to provide any 
such sensitive law enforcement information 
have been ongoing. . . .112 
On July 11, 2011, Chairman Issa and Sen-
ator Grassley wrote to the FBI requesting 
information on the issue of information 
sharing within the Department. The letter 
included a request for information relating 
to the murder of Immigrations and Customs 
Enforcement Agent Jaime Zapata.113 On Au-
gust 12, 2011, the FBI responded. It wrote: 
information about ongoing criminal inves-
tigations, investigative targets, internal de-
liberations about law enforcement options, 
and communications with foreign govern-
ment representatives. In addition, we noti-
fied Committee staff that we have identified 
certain publicly available documents that 
are responsive. While our efforts to identify 
responsive documents are continuing, many 
of your requests seek records relating to on-
going criminal investigations. Based upon 
the Department’s longstanding policy re-
garding the confidentiality of ongoing crimi-
nal investigations, we are not in a position 
to disclose such documents, nor can we con-
firm or deny the existence of records in our 
ongoing investigative files. This policy is 
based on our strong need to protect the inde-
pendence and effectiveness of our law en-
forcement efforts.108 
The letter cited prior Department policy in 
support of its position of non-compliance: 
We are dedicated to holding Agent Terry’s 
killer or killers responsible through the 
criminal justice process that is currently un-
derway, but we are not in a position to pro-
vide additional information at this time re-
garding this active criminal investigation 
for the reasons set forth above. . . .109 
Your letter also asks for specific informa-
tion related to the crime scene and events 
leading to the murder of ICE Agent Jaime 
Zapata in Mexico on February 15, 2011. As 
you know, crime scene evidence and the cir-
cumstances of a crime are generally not 
made public in an ongoing investigation. 
Furthermore, the investigative reports of an 
ongoing investigation are kept confidential 
during the investigation to preserve the in-
tegrity of the investigation and to ensure its 
successful conclusion. We regret that we can-
not provide more details about the investiga-
tion at this time, but we need to ensure all 
appropriate steps are taken to protect the 
integrity of the investigation.114 
On June 14, 2011, after the Department had 
produced 194 pages of non-public documents 
pursuant to the subpoena, the Department 
informed the Committee that it was delib-
erately withholding certain documents: 
The FBI did not provide any documents to 
the Committee regarding the information 
sharing issues raised, though it did offer to 
provide a briefing to staff. It delivered that 
briefing nearly two months later, on October 
5, 2011. 
On October 11, 2011, the Department wrote 
to Chairman Issa. The Department stated: 
We believe that we have now substantially 
concluded our efforts to respond to the Com-
mittee requests set forth in the subpoena 
and the letter of June 8th.115 
The Department was well aware that the 
Committee was struggling to understand 
how the Department created its February 4, 
2011, letter to Senator Grassley, which the 
Committee believed to contain false infor-
mation. To that end, the Department stated: 
As with previous oversight matters, we 
have not provided access to documents that 
contain detailed information about our in-
vestigative activities where their disclosure 
would harm our pending investigations and 
prosecutions. This includes information that 
would identify investigative subjects, sen-
sitive techniques, anticipated actions, and 
other details that would assist individuals in 
evading our law enforcement efforts. Our 
judgments begin with the premise that we 
will disclose as much as possible that is re-
sponsive to the Committee’s interests, con-
sistent with our responsibilities to bring to 
justice those who are responsible for the 
death of Agent Terry and those who violate 
federal firearms laws.110 
The next day, the Committee issued a sub-
poena to Attorney General Holder. 
(b) October 12, 2011, Subpoena 
On October 31, 2011, the Department pro-
duced its first batch of documents pursuant 
to the Committee’s October 12, 2011, sub-
poena.117 This production consisted of 652 
pages. Of these 652 pages, 116 were about the 
Kingery case, a case that the Department 
wanted to highlight in an attempt to dis-
credit some of the original Fast and Furious 
whistleblowers. 
Twenty-eight 
additional 
pages were about an operation from the prior 
administration, the Hernandez case, and 245 
pages were about another operation from the 
prior administration, Operation Wide Re-
ceiver. 
Although the subpoena covered documents 
from the Hernandez and Wide Receiver cases, 
their inclusion into the first production 
batch under the subpoena was indicative of 
the Department’s strategy in responding to 
the subpoena. The Department briefed the 
press on these documents at the same time 
as it produced them to the Committee. The 
Department seemed more interested in spin 
control than in complying with the congres-
sional subpoena. Sixty percent of the docu-
ments in this first production were related 
to either Kingery, Hernandez, or Wide Re-
ceiver, and therefore, unrelated to the grava-
men of the Committee’s investigation into 
Fast and Furious. 
On December 2, 2011, shortly before the At-
torney General’s testimony before the House 
Judiciary Committee, the Department pro-
duced 1,364 pages of documents pertaining to 
the creation of its February 4, 2011, letter.118 
Despite its statements in the October 11, 
2011, letter, the Department, through a letter 
from Deputy Attorney General James Cole, 
publicly admitted under pressure its obvious 
misstatements, formally acknowledging that 
the February 4, 2011, letter ‘‘contains inac-
curacies.’’ 119 
On December 13, 2011, on the eve of the 
Committee’s interview with Gary Grindler, 
Chief of Staff to the Attorney General, the 
Department produced 19 pages of responsive 
documents.120 
On January 5, 2012, the Department pro-
duced 482 pages of documents responsive to 
the subpoena.121 Of these 482 pages, 304 of 
them, or 63 percent, were related to the Wide 
Receiver case. This production brought the 
total number of pages produced pursuant to 
Wide Receiver to 549, nearly 100 more than 
the Department had produced at that time 
regarding Fast and Furious in three docu-
ment productions. 
On January 27, 2012, the Department pro-
duced 486 pages of documents pursuant to 
the October 12, 2011, subpoena.122 In its cover 
letter, the Department stated, ‘‘[t]he major-
ity of materials produced today are respon-
sive to items 7, 11 and 12 of your October 11 
subpoena.’’ There are no documents in the 
production, however, responsive to items 7(b) 
or 11(b)(i–v). The Department wrote in its 
January 27 cover letter: 
We are producing or making available for 
review materials that are responsive to these 
The June 14, 2011, letter arrived one day 
after the Committee held a hearing featuring 
constitutional experts discussing the legal 
obligations of the Department to comply 
with a congressional subpoena. The Depart-
ment’s letter did not address the views ex-
pressed at the hearing, instead reiterating 
its internal policy. The letter noted that the 
Department would not provide access to doc-
uments discussing its use of ‘‘sensitive tech-
niques’’—even though these techniques were 
central to the Committee’s investigation. 
On July 5, 2011, Chairman Issa and Senator 
Grassley wrote to the Department about se-
rious issues involving the lack of informa-
tion sharing among Department components, 
in particular, between the FBI and DEA.111 
These issues raised the possibility that the 
Department 
had 
been 
deliberately 
con-
cealing information about Fast and Furious 
from the Committee, including the roles of 
its component agencies. The next day, the 
Department responded. It wrote: 
As we have previously explained to Com-
mittee staff, we have also withheld internal 
communications that were generated in the 
course of the Department’s effort to respond 
to congressional and media inquiries about 
Operation Fast and Furious. These records 
were created in 2011, well after the comple-
tion of the investigative portion of Operation 
Fast and Furious that the Committee has 
been reviewing and after the charging deci-
sions reflected in the January 25, 2011, in-
dictments. Thus, they were not part of the 
communications regarding the development 
and implementation of the strategy deci-
sions that have been the focus of the Com-
mittee’s inquiry. It is longstanding Execu-
tive Branch practice not to disclose docu-
ments falling into this category because dis-
closure would implicate substantial Execu-
tive Branch confidentiality interests and 
separation of powers principles. Disclosure 
would have a chilling effect on agency offi-
cials’ deliberations about how to respond to 
inquiries from Congress or the media. Such a 
chill on internal communications would 
interfere with our ability to respond as effec-

memos—consistent with the way in which 
the Department of Justice has always con-
ducted itself in its interactions.131 
He again impressed this point upon Com-
mittee Members later in the hearing: 
Well, with the regard to provision of e- 
mails, I thought I’ve made it clear that after 
February the 4th it is not our intention to 
provide e-mail information consistent with 
the way in which the Justice Department 
has always conducted itself.132 
items, most of which pertain to the specific 
investigations that we have already identi-
fied to the Committee. We are not, however, 
providing materials pertaining to other mat-
ters, such as documents regarding ATF cases 
that do not appear to involve the inappro-
priate tactics under review by the Com-
mittee; non-ATF cases, except for certain in-
formation relating to the death of Customs 
and Border Protection Agent Brian Terry; 
administrative 
matters; 
and 
personal 
records.123 
The Department reiterated this position 
less than a week later in a December 14, 2011, 
transcribed interview of Gary Grindler, the 
Attorney General’s Chief of Staff. Depart-
ment counsel broadened the Department’s 
position with respect to sharing documents 
created after February 4, 2011, in refusing to 
allow Grindler to answer any questions re-
lating to conversations that he had with 
anyone in the Department regarding Fast 
and Furious after February 4, 2011. Grindler 
stated: 
What I am saying is that the Attorney 
General made it clear at his testimony last 
week that we are not providing information 
to the committee subsequent to the Feb-
ruary 4th letter.133 
The Department refused to produce docu-
ments pursuant to the subpoena regarding 
investigations that it had not previously 
specified to the Committee, or investigations 
that ‘‘do not appear’’ to involve inappro-
priate tactics. In doing so, the Department 
made itself the sole arbiter of the Commit-
tee’s investigative interests, as well as of the 
use of ‘‘inappropriate’’ tactics. The Depart-
ment has prevented Congress from executing 
its 
constitutionally 
mandated 
oversight 
function, preferring instead to self-regulate. 
The October 12, 2011, subpoena, however, 
covers all investigations in which ATF failed 
to interdict weapons that had been illegally 
purchased or transferred—not just those 
cases previously identified by the Depart-
ment. The subpoena does not give the De-
partment the authority to define which tac-
tics are inappropriate. Rather, the language 
in sections 4 and 5 of the subpoena schedule 
is clear. The Department’s refusal to cooper-
ate on this front and only produce docu-
ments about investigations that it had pre-
viously identified—documents that support 
the Department’s press strategy—is in viola-
tion of its obligation to cooperate with con-
gressional oversight. 
On January 31, 2012, Chairman Issa again 
wrote to the Attorney General, this time 
asking that the Department produce all doc-
uments pursuant to the subpoena by Feb-
ruary 9, 2012.124 The following day, the De-
partment responded. It stated: 
Your most recent letter asks that we com-
plete the production process under the Octo-
ber 11, 2011, subpoena by February 9, 2012. 
The broad scope of the Committee’s requests 
and the volume or material to be collected, 
processed and reviewed in response make it 
impossible to meet that deadline, despite our 
good faith efforts. We will continue in good 
faith to produce materials, but it simply will 
not be possible to finish the collection, proc-
essing and review of materials by the date 
sought in your most recent letter.125 
Department counsel expanded the position 
the Attorney General articulated regarding 
documentary evidence at the House Judici-
ary Committee hearing to include testi-
monial evidence as well.134 Given the initial 
response by the Department to the congres-
sional inquiry into Fast and Furious, the 
comments by Department counsel created a 
barrier preventing Congress from obtaining 
vital information about Fast and Furious. 
The Department has maintained this posi-
tion during additional transcribed inter-
views. In an interview with Deputy Assistant 
Attorney General Jason Weinstein on Janu-
ary 10, 2012, Department counsel prohibited 
him from responding to an entire line of 
questioning about his interactions with the 
Arizona U.S. Attorney’s Office because it 
‘‘implicates 
the 
post-February 
4th 
pe-
riod.’’ 135 
Understanding the post-February 4th pe-
riod is critical to the Committee’s investiga-
tion. Furthermore, documents from this pe-
riod are responsive to the October 12, 2011, 
subpoena. For example, following the Feb-
ruary 4, 2011, letter, Jason Weinstein, at the 
behest of Assistant Attorney General Breuer, 
prepared an analytical review of Fast and 
Furious.136
Weinstein interviewed Emory 
Hurley and Patrick Cunningham of the Ari-
zona U.S. Attorney’s office as part of this re-
view.137 The document that resulted from 
Weinstein’s analysis specifically discussed 
issues relevant to the Committee’s inquiry. 
To date, the Department has not produced 
documents related to Weinstein’s review to 
the Committee. 
Chairman Issa has sent several letters urg-
ing the Department to produce documents 
pertaining to the Fast and Furious from the 
post-indictment period, and raising the pos-
sibility of contempt if the Attorney General 
chose not to comply. Initially, the Depart-
ment refused to produce any documents cre-
ated after January 25, 2011, the date that the 
poena.127 These eight pages, given to the 
Committee by a whistleblower ten months 
earlier, were produced only because a tran-
scribed interview with a former Associate 
Deputy Attorney General was to take place 
the next day. 
On March 2, 2012, the Department produced 
26 pages of documents pursuant to the Octo-
ber 12, 2011, subpoena.128 Five of these docu-
ments were about the Kingery case. Four-
teen documents—over half of the produc-
tion—related to Wide Receiver. Seven pages 
were duplicate copies of a press release al-
ready produced to the Committee. 
On March 16, 2012, the Department pro-
duced 357 pages of documents pursuant to 
the subpoena. Three hundred seven of these 
pages, or 86 percent, related to the Her-
nandez and Medrano cases from the prior Ad-
ministration. Twenty other pages had been 
previously produced by the Department, and 
seven pages were publicly available on the 
Justice Department’s website. 
On April 3, 2012, the Department produced 
116 pages of documents pursuant to the sub-
poena. Forty four of these pages, or 38 per-
cent, related to cases other than Fast and 
Furious. On April 19, 2012, the Department 
produced 188 pages of documents pursuant to 
the subpoena. 
On May 15, 2012, the Department produced 
29 pages of documents pursuant to the sub-
poena. Ten of these pages, or 36 percent, re-
lated to cases other than Fast and Furious. 
The Department has produced a total of 
6,988 pages to the Committee to date.129 
Though the Department recently stated that 
it has ‘‘provided documents to the Com-
mittee at least twice every month since late 
last year,’’ the Department has not produced 
any documents to the Committee in over 30 
days.130 
(c) Post-February 4, 2011, Documents 
Many of the documents the October 12, 
2011, subpoena requires were created or pro-
duced after February 4, 2011. The Depart-
ment first responded to Congress about Fast 
and Furious on this date. The Department 
has steadfastly refused to make any docu-
ments created after February 4, 2011, avail-
able to the Committee. 
The Department’s actions following the 
February 4, 2011, letter to Senator Grassley 
are crucial in determining how it responded 
to the serious allegations raised by the whis-
tleblowers. The October 12, 2011, subpoena 
covers documents that would help Congress 
understand 
what 
the 
Department 
knew 
about Fast and Furious, including when and 
how it discovered its February 4 letter was 
false, and the Department’s efforts to con-
ceal that information from Congress and the 
public. Such documents would include those 
relating to actions the Department took to 
silence or retaliate against Fast and Furious 
whistleblowers and to find out what had hap-
pened, and how the Department assessed the 
culpability of those involved in the program. 
The Attorney General first expressed the 
Department’s position regarding documents 
created after February 4, 2011, in his testi-
mony before the House Judiciary Committee 
on December 8, 2011. In no uncertain terms, 
he stated: 
Yet, as discussed in Section V.B above, the 
Department was acutely aware in October 
2011, approximately three months earlier, ex-
actly what categories of documents the Com-
mittee was seeking. In response to the sub-
poena, the Department had, up to February 
1, 2012, produced more documents relating to 
a single operation years before Fast and Fu-
rious even began than it had relating to Op-
eration Fast and Furious itself. 
On February 16, 2012, the Department pro-
duced 304 pages of documents pursuant to 
the subpoena.126
The production included 
nearly 60 pages of publicly available and pre-
viously produced information, as well as 
other documents previously produced to the 
Committee. 
On February 27, 2012, the Department pro-
duced eight pages pursuant to the sub-

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4187 
June 28, 2012 
case was unsealed. On November 9, 2011, 
Chairman Issa wrote to the Department: 
here to this rolling production schedule until 
we have completed the process of producing 
all responsive documents to which the Com-
mittee is entitled, consistent with the long-
standing policies of the Executive Branch 
across administrations of both parties. More-
over, we intend to send a letter soon memo-
rializing our discussions with your staff 
about the status of our production of docu-
ments within the various categories of the 
subpoena. 
Our efforts to cooperate with the Com-
mittee have been a significant undertaking, 
involving a great deal of hard work by a 
large number of Department employees. The 
Department has been committed to pro-
viding the documents and information nec-
essary to allow the Committee to satisfy its 
core oversight interests regarding the use of 
inappropriate tactics in Fast and Furious. 
to congressional and media inquiries about 
Operation Fast and Furious. These records 
were created in 2011, well after the comple-
tion of the investigative portion of Operation 
Fast and Furious that the Committee has 
been reviewing and after the charging deci-
sions reflected in the January 25, 2011, in-
dictments. Thus, they were not part of the 
communications regarding the development 
and implementation of the strategy deci-
sions that have been the focus of the Com-
mittee’s inquiry. It is longstanding Execu-
tive Branch practice not to disclose docu-
ments falling into this category because dis-
closure would implicate substantial Execu-
tive Branch confidentiality interests and 
separation of powers principles. Disclosure 
would have a chilling effect on agency offi-
cials’ deliberations about how to respond to 
inquiries from Congress or the media. Such a 
chill on internal communications would 
interfere with our ability to respond as effec-
tively and efficiently as possible to congres-
sional oversight requests.142 
Over the past six months, Senator Grassley 
and I have asked for this information on 
many occasions, and each time we have been 
told it would not be produced. This informa-
tion is covered by the subpoena served on the 
Attorney General on October 12, 2011, and I 
expect it to be produced no later than 
Wednesday, November 16, at 5:00 p.m. Failure 
to comply with this request will leave me 
with no other alternative than the use of 
compulsory process to obtain your testi-
mony under oath.

Understanding the Department’s actions 
after Congress started asking questions 
about Fast and Furious is crucial. As you 
know, substantial effort was expended to 
hide the actions of the Department from 
Congress . . . I expect nothing less than full 
compliance with all aspects of the subpoena, 
including complete production of documents 
created after the indictments were unsealed 
on January 25, 2011.138 
On February 14, 2012, Chairman Issa again 
wrote to the Department regarding post-Feb-
ruary 4, 2011, documents, and again raised 
the possibility of contempt: 
On December 2, 2011, the Department pro-
duced documents pertaining to its February 
4, 2011, response to Senator Grassley. When 
the Attorney General testified before Con-
gress on December 8, 2011, he created a new 
cutoff date of February 4, 2011, after which 
no documents would be produced to Con-
gress, despite the fact that such documents 
were covered by the October 12, 2011, sub-
poena. In support of this position regarding 
post-February 4, 2011, documents, in tran-
scribed interviews, Department representa-
tives have asserted a ‘‘separation of powers’’ 
privilege without further explanation or ci-
tation to legal authority.139 The Department 
has not cited any legal authority to support 
this new, extremely broad assertion of privi-
lege. 
On January 31, 2012, Chairman Issa wrote 
to the Attorney General about this new, ar-
bitrary date created by the Department, and 
raised the possibility of contempt: 
In short, the Committee requires full com-
pliance with all aspects of the subpoena, in-
cluding complete production of documents 
created after the Department’s February 4, 
2011, letter. . . . If the Department continues 
to obstruct the congressional inquiry by not 
providing documents and information, this 
Committee will have no alternative but to 
move forward with proceedings to hold you 
in contempt of Congress.140 
The Department responded the following 
day. It said: 
Complying with the Committee’s subpoena 
is not optional. Indeed, the failure to 
produce documents pursuant to a congres-
sional subpoena is a violation of federal law. 
The Department’s letter suggests that its 
failure to produce, among other things, ‘‘de-
liberative documents and other internal 
communications generated in response to 
congressional oversight requests’’ is based on 
the premise that ‘‘disclosure would com-
promise substantial separation of powers 
principles and Executive Branch confiden-
tiality interests.’’ Your February 4, 2011, cut- 
off date of providing documents to the Com-
mittee is entirely arbitrary, and comes from 
a ‘‘separation of powers’’ privilege that does 
not actually exist. 
You cite no legal authority to support your 
new, extremely broad assertion. To the con-
trary, as you know, Congress possesses the 
‘‘power 
of 
inquiry.’’ 
Furthermore, 
‘‘the 
issuance of a subpoena pursuant to an au-
thorized investigation is . . . an indispen-
sable ingredient of lawmaking.’’ Because the 
Department has not cited any legal author-
ity as the basis for withholding documents, 
or provided the Committee with a privilege 
log with respect to documents withheld, its 
efforts to accommodate the Committee’s 
constitutional obligation to conduct over-
sight of the Executive Branch are incom-
plete.143 
* 
* 
* 
* 
*

* 
Please specify a date by which you expect 
the Department to produce all documents re-
sponsive to the subpoena. In addition, please 
specify a Department representative who 
will interface with the Committee for pro-
duction purposes. This individual should also 
serve as the conduit for dealing with possible 
contempt proceedings, should the Depart-
ment continue to ignore the Committee’s 
subpoena.144 
The Department, however, has yet to 
produce any documents pursuant to the sub-
poena created after February 4, 2011. Despite 
warnings by Chairman Issa that the Com-
mittee would initiate contempt if the De-
partment failed to comply with the sub-
poena, 
the 
Department 
has 
refused 
to 
produce documents. 
(d) Interview Requests 
In addition to the October 12, 2011, sub-
poena, the Committee has requested to inter-
view key individuals in Operation Fast and 
Furious and related programs. The Com-
mittee accommodated the Department’s re-
quest to delay an interview with Hope 
MacAllister, the lead case agent for Oper-
ation Fast and Furious, despite her vast 
knowledge of the program. The Committee 
agreed to this accommodation due to the De-
partment’s expressed concern about inter-
viewing a key witness prior to trial. 
Throughout the investigation, the Depart-
ment has had an evolving policy with regard 
to witnesses that excluded ever-broader cat-
egories of witnesses from participating in 
volunteer interviews. The Department first 
refused to allow line attorneys to testify in 
transcribed interviews, and then it prevented 
first-line supervisors from testifying. Next, 
the Department refused to make Senate-con-
firmed Department officials available for 
transcribed interviews. One such Senate-con-
firmed official, Assistant Attorney General 
Lanny Breuer, is a central focus in the Com-
mittee’s investigation. On February 16, 2012, 
the Department retreated somewhat from its 
position, noting in a letter to the Committee 
that it was ‘‘prepared to work with [the 
Committee] to find a mutually agreeable 
date for [Breuer] to appear and answer the 
Committee’s questions, whether or not that 
appearance is public.’’ 145
The Department 
has urged the Committee to reconsider this 
interview request. 
While the Department has facilitated a 
dozen interviews to avoid compulsory deposi-
tions, there have been several instances in 
which the Department has refused to cooper-
ate with the Committee in scheduling inter-
views. The Department has stated that it 
would not make available certain individuals 
that the Committee has requested to inter-
view. On December 6, 2011, the Department 
wrote: 
To the extent responsive materials exist 
that post-date congressional review of this 
matter and were not generated in that con-
text or to respond to media inquiries, and 
likewise do not implicate other recognized 
Department interests in confidentiality (for 
example, matters occurring before a grand 
jury, investigative activities under seal or 
the disclosure of which is prohibited by law, 
core investigative information, or matters 
reflecting 
internal 
Department 
delibera-
tions), we intend to provide them.141 
The Department quoted from its October 
11, 2011, letter, stating: 
On February 16, 2012, the Department re-
sponded. The response did not address the 
post-February 4, 2011, documents, nor did it 
address the possibility of contempt. The De-
partment’s letter stated: 
[A]s we have previously explained to Com-
mittee staff, we have also withheld internal 
communications that were generated in the 
course of the Department’s effort to respond 
We have produced documents to the Com-
mittee on a rolling basis; since late last year 
these productions have occurred approxi-
mately twice a month. It is our intent to ad-
We would like to defer any final decisions 
about the Committee’s request for Mr. 
Swartz’s interview until we have identified 
any responsive documents, some of which 
may implicate equities of another agency. 
The remaining employees you have asked to 
interview are all career employees who are 
either line prosecutors or first- or second- 
level supervisors. James Trusty and Michael 
Morrissey were first-level supervisors during

rious investigation, and Kevin Carwile was a 
second-level supervisor. The remaining three 
employees you have asked to interview— 
Emory Hurley, Serra Tsethlikai, and Joseph 
Cooley—are line prosecutors. We are not pre-
pared to make any of these attorneys avail-
able for interviews.146 
For months after the congressional inquiry 
began, the Department refused to acknowl-
edge that anything improper occurred during 
Fast and Furious. At a May 5, 2011, meeting 
with Committee staff, a Department rep-
resentative first acknowledged that ‘‘there’s 
a there, there.’’ The Attorney General ac-
knowledged publicly that Fast and Furious 
was ‘‘fundamentally flawed’’ on October 7, 
2011. On December 2, 2011, the Department fi-
nally admitted that its February 4, 2011, let-
ter to Senator Grassley contained false in-
formation—something Congress had been 
telling 
the 
Department 
for 
over 
seven 
months. 
Documents in this category include those 
that explain how the Department responded 
to the crisis in the wake of the death of U.S. 
Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry. These doc-
uments will reveal when the Department re-
alized it had a problem, and what actions it 
took to resolve that problem. These docu-
ments will also show whether senior Depart-
ment officials were surprised to learn that 
gunwalking occurred during Fast and Furi-
ous, or if they already knew that to be the 
case. These documents will also identify who 
at the Department was responsible for au-
thorizing retaliation against the whistle-
blowers. The documents may also show the 
Department’s assignment of responsibility to 
officials who knew about the reckless con-
duct or were negligent during Fast and Furi-
ous. 
(c) How the Inter-Agency Task Force Failed 
The Department did, however, make Pat-
rick Cunningham, Chief of the Criminal Di-
vision for the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Ari-
zona, available for an interview. The Com-
mittee had been requesting to interview 
Cunningham since summer 2011. The Depart-
ment finally allowed access to Cunningham 
for 
an 
interview 
in 
December 
2011. 
Cunningham chose to retain private counsel 
instead of Department counsel. On January 
17, 2012, Cunningham canceled his interview 
scheduled for the Committee on January 19, 
2012. 
Chairman 
Issa 
issued 
a 
subpoena 
to 
Cunningham to appear for a deposition on 
January 24, 2012. In a letter dated January 
19, 2012, Cunningham’s counsel informed the 
Committee that Cunningham would ‘‘assert 
his constitutional privilege not to be com-
pelled to be a witness against himself.’’ 147 On 
January 24, 2012, Chairman Issa wrote to the 
Attorney General to express that the ab-
sence of Cunningham’s testimony would 
make it ‘‘difficult to gauge the veracity of 
some of the Department’s claims’’ regarding 
Fast and Furious.148 
On January 27, 2012, Cunningham left the 
Department of Justice. After months of 
Committee requests, the Department finally 
made him available for an interview just be-
fore he left the Department. The actions of 
the Department in delaying the interview 
and Cunningham’s own assertion of the Fifth 
Amendment privilege delayed and denied the 
Committee the benefit of his testimony. 
The Organized Crime Drug Enforcement 
Task Force (OCDETF) program was created 
to coordinate inter-agency information shar-
ing. As early as December 2009, the DEA 
shared information with ATF that should 
have led to arrests and the identification of 
the gun trafficking network that Fast and 
Furious sought to uncover. The Committee 
has received information suggesting that, 
after arrests were made one year later, ATF 
discovered that two Mexican drug cartel as-
sociates at the top of the Fast and Furious 
network had been designated as national se-
curity assets by the FBI, and at times have 
been paid FBI informants. Because of this 
cooperation, these associates are considered 
by some to be unindictable. 
Documents in this category will reveal the 
extent of the lack of information-sharing 
among DEA, FBI, and ATF. Although the 
Deputy Attorney General is aware of this 
problem, he has expressed little interest in 
resolving it. 
VI. ADDITIONAL ACCOMMODATIONS BY 
THE COMMITTEE 
5. FAILURE TO TURN OVER DOCUMENTS 
The Department has failed to turn over 
any documents pertaining to three main cat-
egories contained in the October 12, 2011, 
subpoena. 
(a) Who at Justice Department Headquarters 
Should Have Known of the Reckless Tactics 
The Committee is seeking documents re-
lating to who had access to information 
about the objectionable tactics used in Oper-
ation Fast and Furious, who approved the 
use of these tactics, and what information 
was available to those individuals when they 
approved the tactics. Documents that whis-
tleblowers have provided to the Committee 
indicate that those officials were the senior 
officials in the Criminal Division, including 
Lanny Breuer and one of his top deputies, 
Jason Weinstein. 
Documents in this category include those 
relating to the preparation of the wiretap ap-
plications, as well as certain ATF, DEA, and 
FBI Reports of Investigation. Key decision 
makers at Justice Department headquarters 
relied on these and other documents to ap-
prove the investigation. 
(b) How the Department Concluded that Fast 
and Furious was ‘‘Fundamentally Flawed’’ 
The Committee requires documents from 
the Department relating to how officials 
learned about whistleblower allegations and 
what actions they took as a result. The Com-
mittee is investigating not just management 
of Operation Fast and Furious, but also the 
Department’s efforts to slow and otherwise 
interfere with the Committee’s investiga-
tion. 
order to avoid contempt proceedings. 149 Doc-
uments in category (c) are outside the scope 
of the narrowed request, and so the Depart-
ment no longer needed to produce them to 
avoid contempt proceedings, even though 
such documents are covered by the October 
12, 2011, subpoena. 
The Committee also obtained copies of 
wiretap applications authorized by senior 
Department officials during Operation Fast 
and Furious. These documents, given to the 
Committee by whistleblowers, shined light 
on category (a). Still, many subpoenaed doc-
uments under this category have been delib-
erately withheld by the Department. These 
documents are critical to understanding who 
is responsible for failing to promptly stop 
Fast and Furious. The Department has cited 
such documents as ‘‘core investigative’’ ma-
terials that pertain to ‘‘pending law enforce-
ment matters.’’ 150 To accommodate the De-
partment’s interest in successfully pros-
ecuting criminal defendants in this case, the 
Committee is willing to accept production of 
these documents after the current prosecu-
tions of the 20 straw purchasers indicted in 
January 2011, have concluded at the trial 
level. This deferment should in no way be in-
terpreted as the Committee ceding its legiti-
mate right to receive these documents, but 
instead solely as an accommodation meant 
to alleviate the Department’s concerns about 
preserving the integrity of the ongoing pros-
ecutions. 
In addition to deferring production of cat-
egory (a) documents, the Committee is also 
willing to view these documents in camera 
with limited redactions. These accommoda-
tions represent a significant commitment on 
the part of the Committee to negotiating in 
good faith to avoid contempt. 
Unlike documents in category (a), the De-
partment has no legitimate interest in lim-
iting the Committee’s access to documents 
in category (b). On February 4, 2011, the De-
partment wrote a letter to Congress cat-
egorically denying that gunwalking had oc-
curred. This letter was false. Still, it was not 
withdrawn until December 2011. The Com-
mittee has a right to know how the Depart-
ment learned that gunwalking did in fact 
occur, and how it handled the fallout inter-
nally. The deliberative process privilege is 
not recognized by Congress as a matter of 
law and precedent. By sending a letter that 
contained false and misleading statements, 
the Department forfeited any reasonable ex-
pectation that the Committee would accom-
modate its interest in withholding delibera-
tive process documents. 
On June 20, 2012, minutes before the start 
of the Committee’s meeting to consider a 
resolution holding the Attorney General in 
contempt, the Committee received a letter 
from Deputy Attorney General James Cole 
claiming that the President asserted execu-
tive privilege over certain documents cov-
ered by the subpoena. The Committee has a 
number of concerns about the validity of this 
assertion: 
1. The assertion was transparently not a 
valid claim of privilege given its last minute 
nature; 
2. The assertion was obstructive given that 
it could have and should have been asserted 
months ago, but was not until literally the 
day of the contempt mark-up; 
3. The assertion is eight months late. It 
should have been made by October 25, 2011, 
the subpoena return date; 
4. To this moment, the President himself 
has not indicated that he is asserting execu-
tive privilege; 
5. The assertion is transparently invalid in 
that it is not credible that every document 
As discussed above in Section V.C.5, the 
Department has failed to turn over any docu-
ments responsive to three main categories 
covered by the October 12, 2011, subpoena: 
(a) Who at Justice Department Head-
quarters Should Have Known of the Reckless 
Tactics; 
(b) How the Department Concluded that 
Fast 
and 
Furious 
was 
‘‘Fundamentally 
Flawed’’; and, 
(c) How the Inter-Agency Task Force 
Failed. 
The Committee notified the Justice De-
partment on multiple occasions that its fail-
ure to produce any documents responsive to 
these three categories would force the Com-
mittee 
to 
begin 
contempt 
proceedings 
against the Attorney General. 
On May 18, 2012, Chairman Issa, along with 
Speaker John Boehner, Majority Leader Eric 
Cantor, and Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy, 
wrote a letter to the Attorney General. As 
an accommodation to the Department, the 
letter offered to narrow the scope of docu-
ments the Department needed to provide in

withheld involves a ‘‘communication[ ] au-
thored or solicited and received by those 
members of an immediate White House ad-
viser’s staff who have broad and significant 
responsibility for investigating and formu-
lating the advice to be given the President 
on the particular matter to which the com-
munications relate,’’; 151 
6. The assertion is transparently invalid 
where the Justice Department has provided 
no details by which the Committee might 
evaluate the applicability of the privilege, 
such as the senders and recipients of the doc-
uments; 
7. Even if the privilege were valid as an ini-
tial matter, which it is not, it certainly has 
been overcome here, as: (i) the Committee 
has demonstrated a sufficient need for the 
documents as they are likely to contain evi-
dence important to the Committee’s inquiry 
and (ii) the documents sought cannot be ob-
tained any other way. The Committee has 
spent 16 months investigating, talking to 
dozens of individuals, and collecting docu-
ments from many sources. The remaining 
documents are ones uniquely in the posses-
sion of the Justice Department; and, 
8. Without these documents, the Commit-
tee’s important legislative work will con-
tinue to be stymied. The documents are nec-
essary to evaluate what government reform 
is necessary within the Justice Department 
to avoid the problems uncovered by the in-
vestigation in the future. 
ment Randall was ‘‘ordered [ ] to be brought 
to the bar, reprimanded by the Speaker, and 
held in custody until further resolution of 
the House.’’ 156 Randall was detained until 
January 13, 1796, when the House passed a 
resolution discharging him. 157 In contrast, 
Whitney ‘‘was absolved of any wrongdoing,’’ 
since his actions were against a ‘‘member- 
elect’’ and occurred ‘‘away from the seat of 
government.’’ 158 
Congressional records do not demonstrate 
any question or hesitation regarding wheth-
er Congress possesses the power to hold indi-
viduals in contempt.159 Moreover, there was 
no question that Congress could punish a 
non-Member for contempt.160 Since the first 
contempt proceeding, numerous congres-
sional committees have pursued contempt 
against obstinate administration officials as 
well as private citizens who failed to cooper-
ate 
with 
congressional 
investigations.161 
Since the first proceeding against Randall 
and Whitney, House committees, whether 
standing or select, have served as the vehicle 
used to lay the foundation for contempt pro-
ceedings in the House.162 
On August 3, 1983, the House passed a privi-
leged resolution citing Environmental Pro-
tection Agency Administrator Anne Gorsuch 
Burford with contempt of Congress for fail-
ing to produce documents to a House sub-
committee pursuant to a subpoena.163 This 
was the first occasion the House cited a cabi-
net-level executive branch member for con-
tempt of Congress.164 A subsequent agree-
ment between the House and the Adminis-
trator, as well as prosecutorial discretion, 
was the base for not enforcing the contempt 
citation against Burford.165 
Within the past fifteen years the Com-
mittee on Oversight and Government Reform 
has undertaken or prepared for contempt 
proceedings on multiple occasions. In 1998, 
Chairman Dan Burton held a vote recom-
mending contempt for Attorney General 
Janet Reno based on her failure to comply 
with a subpoena issued in connection with 
the Committee’s investigation into cam-
paign finance law violations.166 On August 7, 
1998, the Committee held Attorney General 
Reno in contempt by a vote of 24 to 18.167 
During 
the 
110th 
Congress, 
Chairman 
Henry Waxman threatened and scheduled 
contempt proceedings against several Ad-
ministration officials.168
Contempt reports 
were drafted against Attorney General Mi-
chael B. Mukasey, Stephen L. Johnson, Ad-
ministrator of the U.S. Environmental Pro-
tection Agency, and Susan E. Dudley, Ad-
ministrator of the Office of Information and 
Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) in the White 
House Office of Management and Budget. 
Business meetings to consider these drafts 
were scheduled.169 Former Attorney General 
Mukasey’s draft contempt report charged 
him with failing to produce documents in 
connection to the Committee’s investigation 
of the release of classified information. Ac-
cording to their draft contempt reports, Ad-
ministrators Johnson and Dudley failed to 
cooperate with the Committee’s lengthy in-
vestigation into California’s petition for a 
waiver to regulate greenhouse gas emissions 
from motor vehicles and the revision of the 
national ambient air quality standards for 
ozone. 
Most recently, the House Judiciary Com-
mittee pursued contempt against former 
White House Counsel Harriet Miers and 
White House Chief of Staff Joshua Bolten.170 
On June 13, 2007, the Committee served sub-
poenas on Miers and Bolten.171
After at-
tempts at accommodations from both sides, 
the Committee determined that Miers and 
Bolten did not satisfactorily comply with 
the subpoenas. On July 25, 2007, the Com-
mittee voted, 22–17, to hold Miers and Bolten 
in contempt of Congress. 
On February 14, 2008, the full House, with 
most Republicans abstaining, voted to hold 
Miers and Bolten in criminal contempt of 
Congress by a margin of 223–42.172 One hun-
dred seventy-three Members of Congress did 
not cast a vote either in favor or against the 
resolution.173 All but nine Members who ab-
stained were Republican.174 Only three Re-
publicans supported the contempt resolution 
for Miers and Bolten.175 This marked the 
first contempt vote by Congress with respect 
to the Executive Branch since the Reagan 
Administration.176 The resolutions passed by 
the House allowed Congress to exercise all 
available remedies in the pursuit of con-
tempt.177 The House Judiciary Committee’s 
action against Miers marked the first time 
that a former administration official had 
ever been held in contempt.178 
B. DOCUMENT PRODUCTIONS 
The Department has refused to produce 
thousands of documents pursuant to the Oc-
tober 12, 2011, subpoena because it claims 
certain documents are Law Enforcement 
Sensitive, others pertain to ongoing criminal 
investigations, and others relate to internal 
deliberative process. 
During the past ten years, the Committee 
on Oversight and Government Reform has 
undertaken a number of investigations that 
resulted in strong opposition from the Exec-
utive Branch regarding document produc-
tions. These investigations include regu-
latory decisions of the Environmental Pro-
tection Agency (EPA), the leak of CIA opera-
tive Valerie Plame’s identity, and the frat-
ricide of Army Corporal Patrick Tillman. In 
all cases during the 110th Congress, the Ad-
ministration 
produced 
an 
overwhelming 
amount of documents, sheltering a narrow 
few by asserting executive privilege. 
In 2008, the Committee received or re-
viewed in camera all agency-level documents 
related to the EPA’s decision regarding Cali-
fornia’s request for a rule waiver, numbering 
approximately 27,000 pages in total.179 Ac-
cording to a Committee Report, the EPA 
The President has now asserted executive 
privilege. This assertion, however, does not 
change the fact that Attorney General Eric 
Holder Jr. is in contempt of Congress today 
for failing to turn over lawfully subpoenaed 
documents explaining the Department’s role 
in withdrawing the false letter it sent to 
Congress. 
VII. HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVES ON 
CONTEMPT 
Contempt proceedings in Congress date 
back over 215 years. These proceedings pro-
vide Congress a valuable mechanism for ad-
judicating its interests. Congressional his-
tory is replete with examples of the pursuit 
of contempt proceedings by House commit-
tees when faced with strident resistance to 
their constitutional authority to exercise in-
vestigative power. 
A. PAST INSTANCES OF CONTEMPT 
Congress first exercised its contempt au-
thority in 1795 when three Members of the 
House charged two businessmen, Robert 
Randall and Charles Whitney, with offering 
bribes in exchange for the passage of legisla-
tion granting Randall and his business part-
ners several million acres bordering Lake 
Erie. 152 This first contempt proceeding began 
with a resolution by the House deeming the 
allegations were adequate ‘‘evidence of an 
attempt to corrupt,’’ and the House reported 
a corresponding resolution that was referred 
to a special committee. 153 The special com-
mittee reported a resolution recommending 
formal proceedings against Randall and 
Whitney ‘‘at the bar of the House.’’ 154 
The House adopted the committee resolu-
tion which laid out the procedure for the 
contempt proceeding. Interrogatories were 
exchanged, testimony was received, Randall 
and Whitney were provided counsel, and at 
the conclusion, on January 4, 1796, the House 
voted 78–17 to adopt a resolution finding 
Randall guilty of contempt. 155 As punish-

ligence, and eight other White House or Of-
fice of the Vice President officials.188 
The only documents the Justice Depart-
ment declined to produce were the FBI 302s 
with respect to the interviews of the Presi-
dent and the Vice President.189 Ultimately, 
the Committee relented in its pursuit of the 
President’s 302.190 The Committee, however, 
persisted in its request for the Vice Presi-
dent’s 302. As a result, the President asserted 
executive privilege over that particular doc-
ument.191 
The Committee specifically included 302s 
in its October 12, 2011, subpoena to the Attor-
ney General regarding Fast and Furious. 
These subpoenaed 302s do not include FBI 
interviews with White House personnel, or 
even any other Executive Branch employee. 
Still, in spite of past precedent, the Depart-
ment has refused to produce those docu-
ments to the Committee or to allow staff an 
in camera review. 
In the 110th Congress, the Committee in-
vestigated the fratricide of Army Corporal 
Patrick Tillman and the veracity of the ac-
count of the capture and rescue of Army Pri-
vate Jessica Lynch.192 The Committee em-
ployed a multitude of investigative tools, in-
cluding hearings, transcribed interviews, and 
non-transcribed interviews. The Administra-
tion produced thousands of documents.193 
The Committee requested the following: 
[T]he White House produce all documents 
received or generated by any official in the 
Executive Office of the President from April 
22 until July 1, 2004, that related to Corporal 
Tillman. The Committee reviewed approxi-
mately 1,500 pages produced in response to 
this request. The documents produced to the 
Committee included e-mail communications 
between senior White House officials holding 
the title of ‘‘Assistant to the President.’’ Ac-
cording to the White House, the White House 
withheld from the Committee only prelimi-
nary drafts of the speech President Bush de-
livered at the White House Correspondents’ 
Dinner on May 1, 2004.194 
withheld only 32 documents related to the 
California waiver decision based on execu-
tive privilege. These included notes of tele-
phone calls or meetings in the White House 
‘‘involving at least one high-ranking EPA of-
ficial and at least one high-ranking White 
House official.’’ 180 The White House Counsel 
informed the Committee that these docu-
ments represented ‘‘deliberations at the very 
highest level of government.’’ 181 
During the Committee’s 2008 investigation 
into the Administration’s promulgation of 
ozone standards, the EPA produced or al-
lowed in camera review of over 35,000 pages of 
documents. The President asserted executive 
privilege over a narrow set of documents, en-
compassing approximately 35 pages. One 
such document included ‘‘talking points for 
the EPA Administrator to use in a meeting 
with [the President].’’ 182 
In furtherance of the Committee’s ozone 
regulation investigation, OIRA produced or 
allowed in camera review of 7,500 docu-
ments.183 Documents produced by EPA and 
OIRA represented pre-decisional opinions of 
career 
scientists 
and 
agency 
counsel.184 
These documents were sensitive because 
some, if not all, related to ongoing litiga-
tion.185 The OIRA Administrator withheld a 
certain number of documents that were com-
munications between OIRA and certain 
White House officials, and the President ulti-
mately ‘‘claimed executive privilege over 
these documents.’’ 186 
Also during the 110th Congress, the Com-
mittee investigated the revelation of CIA op-
erative Valerie Plame’s identity in the news 
media. The Committee’s investigation was 
contemporaneous with the Department of 
Justice’s criminal investigation into the 
leak of this classified information—a situa-
tion nearly identical to the Committee’s cur-
rent investigation into Operation Fast and 
Furious. 
Pursuant to the Committee’s investiga-
tion, the Justice Department produced FBI 
reports of witness interviews, commonly re-
ferred to as ‘‘302s.’’ Specifically, documents 
reviewed by the Committee staff during the 
Valerie Plame investigation included the fol-
lowing: 
FBI interviews of federal officials who did 
not work in the White House, as well as 
interviews of relevant private individuals 
. . . total of 224 pages of records of FBI inter-
view reports with 31 individuals, including 
materials related to a former Secretary, 
Deputy Secretary, Undersecretary [sic], and 
two Assistant Secretaries of State, and other 
former or current CIA and State Department 
officials, including the Vice President’s CIA 
briefer.187 
To accommodate the Committee, the De-
partment permitted in camera review of the 
following: 
[D]ocuments include[ing] redacted reports 
of the FBI interview with Mr. Libby, Andrew 
Card, Karl Rove, Condoleezza Rice, Stephen 
Hadley, Dan Bartlett, and Scott McClellan 
and another 104 pages of additional interview 
reports of the Director of Central Intel-
The Department of Defense produced over 
31,000 responsive documents, and the Com-
mittee received an unprecedented level of ac-
cess to documents and personnel.195 
The Oversight and Government Reform 
Committee’s investigations over the past 
five years demonstrate ample precedent for 
the production of a wide array of documents 
from the Executive Branch. In these inves-
tigations, 
the 
Committee 
received 
pre- 
decisional 
deliberative 
regulatory 
docu-
ments, documents pertaining to ongoing in-
vestigations, and communications between 
and among senior advisors to the President. 
The Committee’s October 12, 2011, subpoena 
calls for many of these same materials, in-
cluding 302s and deliberative documents. 
Still, the Justice Department refuses to 
comply. 
Further, the number of documents the De-
partment has produced during the Commit-
tee’s Fast and Furious investigation pales in 
comparison to those produced in conjunction 
with the Committee’s prior investigations. 
In separate EPA investigations, the Com-
mittee received 27,000 documents and 35,000 
documents respectively. In the Patrick Till-
man investigation, the Committee received 
31,000 documents. Moreover, in the Valerie 
Plame investigation, the Committee re-
ceived access to highly sensitive materials 
despite the fact that the Justice Department 
was conducting a parallel criminal investiga-
tion. 
As of May 15, 2012, in the Fast and Furious 
investigation, in the light most favorable to 
the Department of Justice, it has ‘‘provided 
the Committee over 7,600 pages of docu-
ments’’—a small fraction of what has been 
produced to the Committee in prior inves-
tigations and of what the Department has 
produced to the Inspector General in this 
matter.196 This small number reflects the De-
partment’s lack of cooperation since the 
Committee sent its first letter to the Depart-
ment about Fast and Furious on March 16, 
2011. 
VIII. RULES REQUIREMENTS 
EXPLANATION OF AMENDMENTS

H4303 
June 28, 2012 
Each application for an order authorizing 
or approving the interception of a wire, oral, 
or electronic communication under this 
chapter shall be made in writing upon oath 
or affirmation to a judge of competent juris-
diction. Applications made and orders grant-
ed under this chapter shall be sealed by the 
judge.17 
Similarly, in 1940, Congress passed a stat-
ute giving the Supreme Court the power to 
prescribe rules of pleading, practice, and pro-
cedure in criminal cases.18 In 1946, the mod-
ern grand jury secrecy rule was codified as 
Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal 
Procedure, which provides for criminal pen-
alties for disclosing grand jury informa-
tion.19 
The Department has explained this to the 
Committee repeatedly, including in a letter 
on May 15, 2012: 
Our disclosure to this oversight Committee 
of some material sought by the October 11 
subpoena, such as records covered by grand 
jury secrecy rules and federal wiretap appli-
cations and related information, is prohib-
ited by law or court orders.20 
Despite promising that he would be ‘‘inves-
tigating a president of my own party because 
many of the issues we’re working on began 
on [sic] President Bush,’’ the Chairman also 
refused multiple requests for former Attor-
ney General Michael Mukasey to testify be-
fore the Committee or to meet with Com-
mittee Members informally to discuss the 
origination and evolution of gunwalking op-
erations since 2006.4
Documents obtained 
during the investigation indicate that Mr. 
Mukasey was briefed personally on botched 
efforts to coordinate firearm interdictions 
with Mexican law enforcement officials in 
2007 and was informed directly that such ef-
forts would be expanded during his tenure.5 
The Committee also failed to conduct 
interviews of other key figures. For example, 
the Committee did not respond to a request 
to interview Alice Fisher, who served as As-
sistant Attorney General in charge of the 
Criminal Division from 2005 to 2008, about 
her role in authorizing wiretaps in Operation 
Wide Receiver, or to a request to interview 
Deputy Assistant Attorney General Kenneth 
Blanco, who also authorized wiretaps in Op-
eration Fast and Furious and still works at 
the Department, but who was placed in his 
position under the Bush Administration in 
April 2008.6 No explanation for these refusals 
has been given. 
During the Committee business meeting on 
June 20, 2012, every Democratic amendment 
to correct the Contempt Citation by noting 
these facts was defeated on strictly party- 
line votes. 
II. HOLDING THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IN 
CONTEMPT WOULD BE UNPRECEDENTED 
The House of Representatives has never in 
its history held an Attorney General in con-
tempt of Congress. The only precedent ref-
erenced in the Contempt Citation for holding 
a sitting Attorney General in contempt for 
refusing to provide documents is this Com-
mittee’s vote in 1998 to hold then-Attorney 
General Janet Reno in contempt during the 
campaign finance investigation conducted by 
then-Chairman Dan Burton.7 
Chairman Burton’s investigation was wide-
ly discredited, and the decision to hold the 
Attorney General in contempt was criticized 
by editorial boards across the country as ‘‘a 
gross abuse of his powers as chairman of the 
committee,’’ 8
a 
‘‘fishing 
expedition,’’ 9 
‘‘laced with palpable political motives,’’ 10 
and ‘‘showboating.’’ 11 That action was so 
partisan and so widely discredited that Newt 
Gingrich, who was then Speaker, did not 
bring it to the House Floor for a vote.12 
Similarly, numerous commentators and 
editorial boards have criticized Chairman 
Issa’s recent actions as ‘‘a monstrous witch 
hunt,’’ 13 ‘‘a pointless partisan fight,’’ 14 and 
‘‘dysfunctional Washington as usual.’’ 15 
III. THE COMMITTEE HAS HELD THE ATTORNEY 
GENERAL TO AN IMPOSSIBLE STANDARD 
For more than a year, the Committee has 
held the Attorney General to an impossible 
standard by demanding documents he is pro-
hibited by law from producing. 
One of the key sets of documents de-
manded during this investigation has been 
federal wiretap applications submitted by 
law enforcement agents in order to obtain a 
federal court’s approval to secretly monitor 
the telephone calls of individuals suspected 
of gun trafficking. 
The federal wiretapping statute, which was 
passed by Congress and signed by President 
Lyndon B. Johnson on June 19, 1968, provides 
for a penalty of up to five years in prison for 
the unauthorized disclosure of wiretap com-
munications and prohibits the unauthorized 
disclosure of wiretap applications approved 
by federal judges, who must seal them to 
protect against their disclosure.16 The stat-
ute states: 
Despite these legal prohibitions, the Chair-
man continued to threaten to hold the At-
torney General in contempt for protecting 
these documents. He also publicly accused 
the Attorney General of a ‘‘cover-up,’’ 21 
claimed he was ‘‘obstructing’’ the Commit-
tee’s investigation,22 asserted that he is will-
ing to ‘‘deceive the public,’’ 23 and stated on 
national television that he ‘‘lied.’’ 24 
IV. THE DOCUMENTS
AT ISSUE
IN
THE CON-
TEMPT
CITATION
ARE
NOT
ABOUT 
GUNWALKING 
The documents at issue in the Contempt 
Citation are not related to the Committee’s 
investigation into how gunwalking was initi-
ated and utilized in Operation Fast and Furi-
ous. 
Over the past year, the Department of Jus-
tice has produced thousands of pages of docu-
ments, the Committee has interviewed two 
dozen officials, and the Attorney General has 
testified before Congress nine times. 
In January, Ranking Member Cummings 
issued a comprehensive 95-page staff report 
documenting that Operation Fast and Furi-
ous was in fact the fourth in a series of 
gunwalking operations run by ATF’s Phoe-
nix field division over a span of five years be-
ginning in 2006. Three prior operations—Op-
eration Wide Receiver (2006–2007), the Her-
nandez case (2007), and the Medrano case 
(2008)—occurred during the Bush Administra-
tion. All four operations were overseen by 
the same ATF Special Agent in Charge in 
Phoenix.25 
The Committee has obtained no evidence 
that the Attorney General was aware that 
gunwalking was being used. To the contrary, 
as soon as he learned of its use, the Attorney 
General halted it, ordered an Inspector Gen-
eral investigation, and implemented signifi-
cant internal reform measures.26 
After finding no evidence of wrongdoing by 
the Attorney General, the Committee’s in-
vestigation shifted to focusing on a single 
letter sent by the Department’s Office of 
Legislative Affairs to Senator Charles Grass-
ley on February 4, 2011. This letter initially 
denied allegations that ATF ‘‘knowingly al-
lowed the sale of assault weapons to a straw 
purchaser who then transported them into 
Mexico’’ and stated that ‘‘ATF makes every 
effort to interdict weapons that have been 
purchased illegally and prevent their trans-
portation to Mexico.’’ 27 
The Department has acknowledged that its 
letter was inaccurate and has formally with-
drawn it. On December 2, 2011, the Depart-
ment wrote that ‘‘facts have come to light 
during the course of this investigation that 
MINORITY VIEWS 
Report of the Committee on Oversight and 
Government Reform 
Resolution Recommending that the House of 
Representatives Find Eric H. Holder, Jr., 
Attorney General, U.S. Department of Jus-
tice, in Contempt of Congress for Refusal to 
Comply with a Subpoena Duly Issued by 
the Committee on Oversight and Govern-
ment Reform 
On June 20, 2012, the Committee adopted 
on a strictly party-line vote a report and res-
olution (hereinafter ‘‘Contempt Citation’’) 
concluding that Attorney General Eric H. 
Holder, Jr., the chief law enforcement officer 
of the United States, should be held in con-
tempt of Congress for declining to produce 
certain documents pursuant to the Commit-
tee’s investigation of ‘‘gunwalking’’ during 
Operation Fast and Furious and previous op-
erations. 
Committee Democrats were unanimous in 
their opposition to the Contempt Citation. 
These dissenting views conclude that Con-
gress has a Constitutional responsibility to 
conduct vigorous oversight of the executive 
branch, but that holding the Attorney Gen-
eral in contempt would be an extreme, un-
precedented action based on partisan elec-
tion-year politics rather than the facts un-
covered during the investigation. 
These views find that the Committee failed 
to honor its Constitutional responsibility to 
avoid unnecessary conflict with the execu-
tive branch by seeking reasonable accom-
modations when possible. The Committee 
flatly rejected a fair and reasonable offer 
made by the Attorney General to provide ad-
ditional 
internal 
deliberative 
documents 
sought by the Committee in exchange for a 
good faith commitment toward resolving the 
contempt dispute. Instead, the Committee 
has repeatedly shifted the goalposts in this 
investigation after failing to find evidence to 
support its unsubstantiated allegations. 
The Contempt Citation adopted by the 
Committee contains serious and significant 
errors, omissions, and misrepresentations. 
To address these inaccuracies, these views 
hereby incorporate and attach the 95-page 
staff report issued by Ranking Member Eli-
jah Cummings in January 2012, which pro-
vides a comprehensive analysis of the evi-
dence obtained during the Committee’s in-
vestigation. 
I. THE COMMITTEE’S ACTIONS HAVE BEEN 
HIGHLY PARTISAN 
The Committee’s contempt vote on June 
20, 2012, was the culmination of one of the 
most highly politicized congressional inves-
tigations in decades. It was based on numer-
ous unsubstantiated allegations that tar-
geted the Obama Administration for polit-
ical purposes, and it ignored documented evi-
dence of gunwalking operations during the 
previous administration. 
During the Committee’s 16-month inves-
tigation, the Committee refused all Demo-
cratic requests for witnesses and hearings. In 
one of the most significant flaws of the in-
vestigation, the Chairman refused multiple 
requests to hold a public hearing with Ken-
neth Melson, the former head of ATF, the 
agency responsible for conducting these op-
erations.1 The Chairman’s refusal came after 
Mr. Melson told Committee investigators 
privately in July 2011 that he never informed 
senior officials at the Justice Department 
about gunwalking during Operation Fast and 
Furious because he was unaware of it him-
self.2 Mr. Melson’s statements directly con-
tradict the claim in the Contempt Citation 
that senior Justice Department officials 
were aware of gunwalking because Mr. 
Melson briefed Gary Grindler, then-Acting 
Deputy Attorney General, in March 2010.3

June 28, 2012 
tempt proceedings in order to conduct a seri-
ous and careful review of presidential asser-
tions of executive privilege, Chairman Issa 
stated that ‘‘I claim not to be a constitu-
tional scholar’’ and proceeded with the con-
tempt vote.41 
In contrast, former Committee Chairman 
Henry Waxman put off a contempt vote after 
President George W. Bush asserted executive 
privilege in the investigation into the leak 
of the covert status of CIA operative Valerie 
Plame.42 He took the same course of action 
after President Bush asserted executive 
privilege over documents relating to the En-
vironmental Protection Agency’s ozone regu-
lation on the same day as a scheduled con-
tempt vote. At the time, he stated: 
I want to talk with my colleagues on both 
sides of the aisle about this new develop-
ment. I want to learn more about the asser-
tion and the basis for this assertion of the 
executive privilege.43 
The accommodation required is not simply 
an exchange of concessions or a test of polit-
ical strength. It is an obligation of each 
branch to make a principled effort to ac-
knowledge, and if possible to meet, the le-
gitimate needs of the other branch.34 
VI. THE
COMMITTEE’S
DECISION
TO
PRESS 
FORWARD WITH CONTEMPT LED TO THE AD-
MINISTRATION’S
ASSERTION
OF
EXECUTIVE 
PRIVILEGE 
After the Chairman refused the Attorney 
General’s good faith offer—and it became 
clear that a Committee contempt vote was 
inevitable—the President asserted executive 
privilege over the narrow category of docu-
ments still at issue. The Administration 
made clear that it was still willing to nego-
tiate on Congress’ access to the documents if 
contempt could be resolved. 
On June 20, 2012, Deputy Attorney General 
James Cole wrote to the Chairman to inform 
the Committee that ‘‘the President, in light 
of the Committee’s decision to hold the con-
tempt vote, has asserted executive privilege 
over the relevant post-February 4 docu-
ments.’’ 35 An accompanying letter from At-
torney General Holder described the docu-
ments covered by the privilege as limited to 
‘‘internal Department ‘documents from after 
February 4, 2011, related to the Department’s 
response to Congress.’ ’’ 36 
Claims by House Speaker John Boehner 
and others that the Administration’s asser-
tion of executive privilege raises questions 
about the President’s personal knowledge of 
gunwalking reflect a misunderstanding of 
the scope of the privilege asserted.37 Regard-
ing the narrow subset of documents covered 
by the assertion, the letter from Attorney 
General explained: 
indicate that the February 4 letter contains 
inaccuracies.’’ 28 
Acknowledging these inaccuracies, the De-
partment also provided the Committee with 
1,300 pages of internal deliberative docu-
ments relating to how the letter to Senator 
Grassley was drafted. These documents dem-
onstrate that officials in the Office of Legis-
lative Affairs who were responsible for draft-
ing the letter did not intentionally mislead 
Congress, but instead relied on inaccurate 
assertions and strong denials from officials 
‘‘in the best position to know the relevant 
facts: ATF and the U.S. Attorney’s Office in 
Arizona, both of which had responsibility for 
Operation Fast and Furious.’’ 29 
Despite receiving these documents explain-
ing how the letter to Senator Grassley was 
drafted, the Committee moved the goalposts 
and demanded additional internal documents 
created after February 4, 2011, the date the 
letter to Senator Grassley was sent. It is un-
clear why the Committee needs these docu-
ments. This narrow subset of additional doc-
uments—which have nothing to do with how 
gunwalking was initiated in Operation Fast 
and Furious—is now the sole basis cited in 
the Contempt Citation for holding the Attor-
ney General in contempt.30 
V. THE COMMITTEE REFUSED A GOOD FAITH 
OFFER BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL FOR AD-
DITIONAL DOCUMENTS 
The Committee failed to honor its Con-
stitutional responsibility to avoid unneces-
sary conflict with the Executive Branch by 
seeking reasonable accommodations when 
possible. On the evening before the Commit-
tee’s contempt vote, the Attorney General 
met with Chairman Issa, Ranking Member 
Cummings, Senator Grassley, and Senator 
Patrick Leahy. The Attorney General offered 
to take the following steps in response to the 
Committee’s demands for additional docu-
ments. Specifically, the Attorney General: 
They were not generated in the course of 
the conduct of Fast and Furious. Instead, 
they were created after the investigative 
tactics at issue in that operation had termi-
nated and in the course of the Department’s 
deliberative process concerning how to re-
spond to congressional and related media in-
quiries into that operation.38 
(1) offered to provide additional internal 
deliberative Department documents, created 
even after February 4, 2011; 
(2) offered a substantive briefing on the De-
partment’s actions relating to how they de-
termined the letter contained inaccuracies; 
(3) agreed to Senator Grassley’s request 
during the meeting to provide a description 
of the categories of documents that would be 
produced and withheld; and 
(4) agreed to answer additional substantive 
requests for information from the Com-
mittee. 
The Attorney General’s letter also ex-
plained the Administration’s legal rationale 
for invoking executive privilege over inter-
nal deliberative Justice Department docu-
ments, citing opinions from former Attor-
neys General Michael B. Mukasey, John 
Ashcroft, William French Smith, and Janet 
Reno, as well as former Solicitor General 
and Acting Attorney General Paul D. Clem-
ent.39 The letter also quoted the Supreme 
Court in United States v. Nixon, writing: 
Although the Committee ultimately dis-
agreed with the validity of President Bush’s 
assertions of executive privilege, in neither 
case did the Committee go forward with con-
tempt 
proceedings 
against 
the 
officials 
named in the contempt citations. 
Similarly, Rep. John Dingell, as Chairman 
of the Energy and Commerce Committee 
during that Committee’s 1981 investigation 
into the Department of Interior, received an 
assertion of executive privilege from the 
Reagan Administration regarding documents 
pertaining to the administration of the Min-
eral Lands Leasing Act.44 Before proceeding 
to contempt, the Committee held two sepa-
rate hearings on the executive privilege as-
sertion, and the Committee invited the At-
torney General to testify regarding his legal 
opinion supporting the claim of executive 
privilege.45 
VIII. THE INVESTIGATION HAS BEEN 
CHARACTERIZED BY UNSUBSTANTIATED CLAIMS 
The Committee’s investigation of ATF 
gunwalking operations has been character-
ized by a series of unfortunate and unsub-
stantiated allegations against the Obama 
Administration that turned out to be inac-
curate. 
For example, during an interview on na-
tional television on October 16, 2011, the 
Chairman accused the Federal Bureau of In-
vestigation (FBI) of concealing evidence of 
the murder of Agent Brian Terry by hiding a 
‘‘third gun’’ found at the murder scene.46 The 
FBI demonstrated quickly that this claim 
was unsubstantiated.47 Although the Chair-
man admitted during a subsequent hearing 
that ‘‘we do go down blind alleys regularly,’’ 
no apology was issued to the law enforce-
ment agents that were accused of a cover- 
up.48 
At the same time, the Chairman has de-
fended the previous Administration’s oper-
ations as ‘‘coordinated.’’ 49 In response to a 
question about gunwalking during the Bush 
Administration, the Chairman stated: 
We know that under the Bush Administra-
tion there were similar operations, but they 
were coordinated with Mexico. They made 
every effort to keep their eyes on the weap-
ons the whole time.50 
The Attorney General noted that his offer 
included documents and information that 
went even beyond those demanded in the 
Committee’s subpoena. In exchange, the At-
torney General asked the Chairman for a 
good faith commitment to work towards a 
final resolution of the contempt issue.31 
Chairman Issa did not make any sub-
stantive changes to his position. Instead, he 
declined to commit to a good faith effort to 
work towards resolving the contempt issue 
and flatly refused the Attorney General’s 
offer. 
There is no question that the Constitution 
authorizes Congress to conduct rigorous in-
vestigations in support of its legislative 
functions.32 The Constitution also requires 
Congress and the executive branch to seek to 
accommodate each other’s interests and to 
avoid unnecessary conflict. As the D.C. Cir-
cuit has held: 
[E]ach branch should take cognizance of an 
implicit constitutional mandate to seek op-
timal accommodation through a realistic 
evaluation of the needs of the conflicting 
branches in the particular fact situation.33 
Similarly, then-Attorney General William 
French Smith, who served under President 
Ronald Reagan, observed: 
To the contrary, the staff report issued by 
Ranking Member Cummings on January 31, 
2012, documents at least three operations 
during the previous Administration in which 
coordination efforts were either non-existent 
or severely deficient.51 
In addition, the Chairman has stated re-
peatedly that senior Justice Department of-
ficials were ‘‘fully aware’’ of gunwalking in 
Operation Fast and Furious.52
After con-
ducting two dozen transcribed interviews, 
none of the officials and agents involved said 
The threat of compelled disclosure of con-
fidential Executive Branch deliberative ma-
terial can discourage robust and candid de-
liberations, for ‘‘[h]uman experience teaches 
that those who expect public dissemination 
of their remarks may well temper candor 
with a concern for appearances and for their 
own interests to the detriment of the deci-
sionmaking process.’’ . . . Thus, Presidents 
have repeatedly asserted executive privilege 
to protect confidential Executive Branch de-
liberative materials from congressional sub-
poena.40 
VII. THE COMMITTEE FAILED TO RESPONSIBLY 
CONSIDER THE EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE ASSER-
TION 
Despite requests from several Committee 
Members, the Committee did not delay or 
postpone the business meeting in order to re-
sponsibly examine the Administration’s as-
sertion of executive privilege and determine 
whether it would be appropriate to continue 
contempt proceedings against the Attorney 
General. 
Instead of following the example of pre-
vious Committee Chairmen who put off con-

June 28, 2012 
they informed the Attorney General or other 
senior 
Department 
officials 
about 
gunwalking in Operation Fast and Furious. 
Instead, the heads of the agencies respon-
sible for the operation—ATF and the U.S. 
Attorney’s Office—told Committee inves-
tigators just the opposite, that they never 
informed senior Department officials about 
gunwalking in Operation Fast and Furious 
because they were unaware of it.53 
Finally, the Chairman has promoted an ex-
treme conspiracy theory that the Obama Ad-
ministration intentionally designed Oper-
ation 
Fast 
and 
Furious 
to 
promote 
gunwalking. He stated in December 2011 that 
the Administration ‘‘made a crisis and they 
are using this crisis to somehow take away 
or 
limit 
people’s 
second 
amendment 
rights.’’ 54 This offensive claim has also been 
made by Rush Limbaugh and other conserv-
ative media personalities during the course 
of the investigation. For example, on June 
20, 2011, Mr. Limbaugh stated: 
The real reason for Operation Gunrunner 
or Fast and Furious, whatever they want to 
call it now, the purpose of this was so that 
Obama and the rest of the Democrats can 
scream bloody murder about the lack of gun 
control in the U.S., which is causing all the 
murders in Mexico. This was a setup from 
the get-go.55 
Another conservative commentator stated 
that ‘‘their political agenda behind this en-
tire thing was to blame American gun shops 
for cartel violence in America in order to 
push an anti-Second Amendment, more regu-
lations on these gun shops.’’ 56 Yet another 
one stated: 
This was purely a political operation. You 
send the guns down to Mexico, therefore you 
support the political narrative that the 
Obama administration wanted supported. 
That all these American guns are flooding 
Mexico, they’re the cause of the violence in 
Mexico, and therefore we need draconian gun 
control laws here in America.57 
As recently as this month, Committee 
Member John Mica repeated this claim on 
Fox News. On June 15, 2012, he stated: 
People forget how all this started. This ad-
ministration is a gun control administra-
tion. They tried to put the violence in Mex-
ico on the blame of the United States. So 
they concocted this scheme and actually 
sending our federal agents, sending guns 
down there, and trying to cook some little 
deal to say that we have got to get more 
guns under control.58 
There is no evidence to support this con-
spiracy theory. To the contrary, the docu-
ments obtained and interviews conducted by 
the 
Committee 
demonstrate 
that 
gunwalking began in 2006, was used in three 
operations during the Bush Administration, 
and was a misguided tactic utilized by the 
ATF field division in Phoenix.59

ant to House Resolution 708, the resolu-

The SPEAKER pro tempore. After 
debate on the resolution, it shall be in 
order to consider a motion to refer if 
offered by the gentleman from Michi-
gan (Mr. DINGELL) or his designee 
which shall be debatable for 10 minutes 
equally divided and controlled by the 
proponent and an opponent. 
The gentleman from California (Mr. 
ISSA) and the gentleman from Mary-
land (Mr. CUMMINGS) each will control 
25 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
Brian Terry, I always believed that, in 
time, we would reach an accommoda-
tion sufficient to get the information 
needed for the American people while 
at the same time preserving the ongo-
ing criminal investigations. 
I am proud to say that our com-
mittee has maintained the ability for 
the Justice Department to continue 
their ongoing prosecutions. Neither the 
majority nor the minority has allowed 
any material to become public to com-
promise that. However, the facts re-
main—in Fast and Furious, the Depart-
ment of Justice permitted the sale of 
more than 2,000 weapons that fell into 
the hands of the Mexican drug cartels, 
which was both reckless and inexcus-
able. And it clearly was known by peo-
ple, both career professionals and polit-
ical 
appointees, 
from 
the 
lowliest 
members on the ground in Phoenix to 
high-ranking officials in the Depart-
ment of Justice. But that’s not what 
we’re here for today. 
Today we are here on a very narrow 
contempt, one that the Speaker of the 
House, in his wisdom and assistance, 
has helped us to fashion. Let it be 
clear: we still have unanswered ques-
tions on a myriad of areas related to 
Operation Fast and Furious. But today 
we are only here to determine how, 
over the 10 months from the time in 
which the American people and the 
Congress of the United States were lied 
to, given false—literally the reverse 
statement, that ‘‘no guns were allowed 
to walk’’ during those 10 months before 
the Justice Department finally owned 
up and recognized that they had to 
come clean that, in fact, Fast and Furi-
ous was all about gunwalking. 
The Department of Justice main-
tained a series of documents. Many of 
these documents are believed to be 
communications between and with the 
very individuals at the heart of the de-
cision to go forward with Fast and Fu-
rious. Therefore, we have focused our 
limited contempt on those documents. 
If our committee is able to receive the 
documents in totality that show who 
brought about the dishonest statement 
to Congress and who covered it up for 
10 months, we believe that will allow 
us to backtrack to the individuals who 
ultimately believed in Fast and Furi-
ous, facilitated Fast and Furious, and 
ultimately made it responsible for 
Brian Terry’s death. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. ISSA. I yield myself an addi-
tional 15 seconds. 
I won’t read everything that’s in my 
opening statement. But I will read just 
one more thing. 
These words were said on the House 
floor in 2008 when Speaker PELOSI sup-
ported contempt. She said: 
Congress has the responsibility of over-
sight of the executive branch. I know that 
Members on both sides of the aisle take that 
responsibility very seriously. Oversight is an 
institutional obligation to ensure against 
abuse of power. Subpoena authority is a vital 
tool for that oversight. 
Speaker PELOSI, 2008. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, I ask unani-
mous consent that all Members may 
have 5 legislative days within which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
sert extraneous materials into the 
RECORD for both resolutions made in 
order under the rule. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 
2 minutes. 
I never thought that we would be 
here today. I never thought this point 
would come. Throughout 18 months of 
investigation, through countless areas 
of negotiations in order to get the min-
imum material necessary to find out 
the facts behind Fast and Furious and 
the murder of Border Patrol Agent 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Today, Mr. Speaker, is a historic day 
in many ways. On the one hand, in a 
landmark decision by Chief Justice 
John 
Roberts, 
the 
Supreme 
Court 
upheld the health care bill, ensuring 
that millions of American families will 
finally have access to effective and af-
fordable health care. 
On the other hand, Republican lead-
ers of the House of Representatives are 
about to plunge into the history books 
as some of the most extreme and par-
tisan ever. Rather than working to-
gether in a bipartisan way to create 
jobs and help our Nation’s economic re-
covery, they’re rushing to the floor 
under emergency procedures with a 
contempt resolution that is riddled 
with errors and is motivated by par-
tisan politics. 
When I first heard about the allega-
tions of gunwalking at ATF, I was out-
raged. I fully supported our commit-
tee’s goals of finding out how it start-
ed, how it was used, and how it may 
have contributed to the death of Bor-
der Patrol Agent Brian Terry. I made a 
personal commitment, which I will 
keep, to the Terry family to conduct a 
responsible and thorough inquiry. 
But today’s contempt vote is a cul-
mination of one of the most highly po-
liticized and reckless congressional in-
vestigations in decades. After receiving 
thousands of pages of documents from 
the Justice Department, conducting 
two dozen transcribed interviews, and 
hearing testimony from the Attorney 
General nine times, here are the facts: 
First, the committee has obtained no 
evidence that the Attorney General au-
thorized, condoned, or knew about 
gunwalking. Chairman ISSA admitted 
this just yesterday before the Rules 
Committee. We’ve seen no evidence 
that the Attorney General lied to Con-
gress or engaged in a coverup. We’ve 
seen no evidence that the White House 
had 
anything 
to 
do 
with 
the 
gunwalking operations—Chairman ISSA 
admitted this on FOX News Sunday 
this past weekend. 
Democrats wanted a real investiga-
tion. But Chairman ISSA refused 10 dif-
ferent requests to hold a hearing with 
the director of ATF, the agency that 
ran these misguided operations. Let me 
say that again. During this entire in-
vestigation, no Member of the House 
has been able to pose a single question 
to the head of ATF at a public hearing. 
How could you have a credible inves-
tigation of gunwalking at ATF and 
never hold a single hearing with the 
leadership of the agency in charge? The 
answer is, you can’t. 
Based on the documents, we now 
know that gunwalking, in fact, started 
in 2006. Yesterday, Chairman ISSA said 
this about the misguided operations 
during the Bush administration: ‘‘They 
were all flops. They were all failures.’’ 
The committee has obtained docu-
mentary evidence that former Attor-
ney General Mukasey was personally

briefed on these botched interdiction 
efforts during his tenure and that he 
was told they would be expanded. 
Chairman ISSA
refused to call Mr. 
Mukasey for a hearing or even for a 
private meeting. During our commit-
tee’s year and a half investigation, the 
chairman refused every single Demo-
cratic request for a witness. 
Instead of taking any of these rea-
sonable steps as part of a credible and 
even-handed investigation to deter-
mine facts, House Republican leaders 
rushed this resolution to the floor only 
1 week after it was voted out of com-
mittee. In contrast, during the last 
Congress, House leaders continued to 
negotiate for 6 months to try to avoid 
contempt in the United States Attor-
neys investigation. 
Mr. Speaker, some of my colleagues 
on the other side seem almost giddy 
about today’s vote. After turning this 
investigation into an election year 
witch hunt, they have somehow con-
vinced the Speaker to take it to the 
floor. 
vote don’t want to have this conversa-
tion, and they aren’t serious about 
stopping gun trafficking. They simply 
want to embarrass the administration, 
even though the committee’s 16-month 
investigation found no evidence the At-
torney 
General 
knew 
about 
gunwalking, even though there was no 
evidence of White House involvement 
in gunwalking, all of which Chairman 
ISSA
admitted on national TV last 
week. 
So if we’re going to talk about gun 
trafficking, let’s be clear: this is about 
politics, not safety. 
Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, the minority 
knows that, in fact, this contempt is 
all about the Attorney General’s re-
fusal to turn over documents, not 
whether or not it was his lieutenants 
or he that personally was involved in 
Fast and Furious. 
With that, I yield 2 minutes to the 
distinguished former chairman of the 
Judiciary Committee, the gentleman 
from Wisconsin (Mr. SENSENBRENNER). 
Mr. SENSENBRENNER. Mr. Speak-
er, this isn’t about politics. This is 
about the Constitution, and it’s about 
Congress’s mandate to do oversight 
over both the executive and judicial 
branches of government. 
The President is asserting executive 
privilege to attempt to shield these 
documents, and he is relying on a type 
of privilege called the deliberative 
process privilege. However, that privi-
lege disappears when Congress is inves-
tigating evidence of wrongdoing. 
In 1997, the U.S. Court of Appeals for 
the District of Columbia Circuit wrote, 
in part: 
Moreover, the privilege disappears alto-
gether when there is any reason to believe 
government misconduct occurred. 
In another case that was decided by 
the First Circuit in 1995, it says that 
the grounds that shielding internal 
government deliberations in this con-
text does not serve ‘‘the public’s inter-
est in honest, effective government.’’ 
There’s been misconduct that’s al-
ready a matter of public record in two 
instances. 
The 
Justice 
Department 
wrote Senator GRASSLEY in January of 
2011 saying that the ATF-sanctioned 
gunwalking across the border was 
false, and it took them 9 months to re-
tract that letter. So they misled Con-
gress, and then 9 months later they 
said, Oops, maybe we did mislead Con-
gress and we’ll withdraw the letter. 
And in May 2011, the Attorney General 
testified before the Judiciary Com-
mittee that he first heard of Operation 
Fast and Furious a few weeks before 
the hearing. Over 6 months later, he 
conceded that he should have said ‘‘a 
few months.’’ 
Now, this very clearly shows that 
Congress has got the obligation to get 
to the bottom of this and that the as-
sertion of executive privilege by the 
President and the Attorney General is 
not based in law. We ought to go ahead 
and do our job and do our oversight. 
It’s too bad that the Justice Depart-
ment has decided to try to obstruct 
Congress’ ability to do it. 
b 1440 
And they are finally about to get the 
prize they have been seeking for more 
than a year: holding the Attorney Gen-
eral of the United States of America in 
contempt. 
They may view today’s vote as a suc-
cess, but in reality, it is a sad failure— 
a failure of House leadership, a failure 
of our constitutional obligations, and a 
failure of our responsibilities to the 
American people. 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. ISSA. I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentleman from Pennsylvania, the dis-
tinguished Congressman MEEHAN, a 
former U.S. attorney in that district. 
Mr. MEEHAN. Thank you, Mr. Chair-
man. 
Mr. Speaker, this is not about poli-
tics, though there are some who want 
to suggest that it is because if they 
yell loud enough and long enough, it 
will deflect the truth of the matter. 
Frankly, it’s not about ‘‘gotcha.’’ As a 
former prosecutor myself, the Attorney 
General personifies the pursuit of jus-
tice, and I want to see him do well. But 
it is about accountability. 
Agent Brian Terry is dead, protecting 
our border, and 563 days later, the 
Terry family still does not know why it 
occurred. What they do know is that 
the very agency that initiated Fast and 
Furious, the Department of Justice 
under Attorney General Eric Holder, 
called the operation ‘‘fatally flawed.’’ 
And then the wagons got circled. 
It’s about the separation of powers. 
As uncomfortable as it may be, at 
times it’s a fundamental tenet and a 
strength of our democracy that Con-
gress is given not just the power, but 
the responsibility, to exercise its duty 
of oversight over the Executive, espe-
cially when, by their own admission, 
things have gone glaringly wrong. 
Because the Justice Department has 
stubbornly resisted the legitimate in-
quiries of Congress over Operation Fast 
and Furious, there’s so much we do not 
know. 
But 
because 
whistleblowers 
within the Department of Justice were 
outraged 
at 
mischaracterizations, 
there’s a great deal that we do know. 
What we do know is that we have 
been dealing with a systematic effort 
to deflect attention away from the de-
cisions and the determinations that 
were made at the highest levels of the 
Department of Justice, where informa-
tion was brought directly to individ-
uals at the highest levels of the De-
partment of Justice, information that 
was contained in wiretap affidavits 
that lay out in explicit detail the mat-
ters related to Fast and Furious. 
Mr. Speaker, there is a famous 
quotation in the Department of Justice 
about the responsibility of the Attor-
ney General not being to win cases, but 
to assure that justice is pursued and 
retained. 
Mr. Speaker, it is incumbent and a 
responsibility on this House to do what 
is required to do in this circumstance 
and to support the request that we be 
given the documents to obtain the 
facts that will allow us to draw the 
conclusions which I believe will allow 
us to get to the bottom of this level. 
Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the distinguished gen-
tleman from Illinois (Mr. QUIGLEY). 
Mr. QUIGLEY. Those bringing this 
contempt vote say they want to talk 
about gunwalking and how to stop it. 
Okay, let’s have that conversation. 
They say they want to stop gun traf-
ficking and keep our ATF agents safe. 
Well, then let’s properly fund the ATF, 
which has the same number of agents 
since 1970. 
They say they want to stop gun traf-
ficking. Well, then appoint a perma-
nent ATF Director, which the agency 
hasn’t had in 6 years. 
They say they want to stop gun traf-
ficking. Well, then let’s pass some laws 
which actually deter straw purchasers. 
Straw purchasers can currently buy 
thousands of AK–47s, lie on their paper-
work, and the penalty is equivalent to 
a moving violation. 
They say they want to stop gun traf-
ficking. Well, then let’s give the agents 
in the field what they’ve been asking 
for: the ability to track multiple pur-
chases of long guns. These long guns 
include AK–47s, variant assault weap-
ons, and .50 caliber semiautomatic 
sniper rifles, the weapons of choice for 
international drug cartels. 
They say they want to stop gun traf-
ficking. Well, then let’s close the gun 
show loophole which currently allows 
anyone to purchase any gun they want 
without background check. Felons, do-
mestic violence abusers, those with se-
vere mental illness, even those on the 
terrorist watch list can currently walk 
into a gun show and purchase any gun 
they want. 
Yes, 2,000 guns were allowed to walk 
to Mexico, but the truth is tens of 
thousands of guns flow across our bor-
der every year because of those lax gun 
laws. But those bringing this contempt

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4404 
June 28, 2012 
Pass the resolution. 
Mr. CUMMINGS. I yield 2 minutes to 
a member of the committee, the gen-
tleman from Virginia (Mr. CONNOLLY). 
Mr. CONNOLLY of Virginia. Mr. 
Speaker, the 112th Congress is on the 
verge of becoming the first in the his-
tory of the country to hold a sitting 
Cabinet member in contempt, cement-
ing its legacy as the most partisan 
House of Representatives perhaps of all 
time. When they say it’s not about pol-
itics, you can be sure it’s about poli-
tics. 
The majority’s irresponsible and un-
precedented contempt vote brings dis-
honor to this House, which has become 
so clouded in judgment, so besotted 
with rancor and partisanship, that it’s 
incapable of addressing a fundamental 
separation of powers conflict in a seri-
ous and fair fashion. 
In refusing to engage in good-faith 
negotiations with the Department of 
Justice and the Attorney General, the 
majority has exposed this contempt ci-
tation for what it really is: an extraor-
dinarily shameful political witch hunt 
aimed at trashing an honorable man. 
b 1450 
It is unacceptable that we are rush-
ing to the floor this unprecedented con-
tempt resolution. Yesterday, Ranking 
Member CUMMINGS sent a letter to the 
Speaker highlighting 100 errors, omis-
sions, and mischaracterizations of fact 
contained in the contempt citation 
itself, rushed out of our committee last 
week on a party-line vote. 
Although some of the contempt cita-
tion’s flaws are simply misleading, oth-
ers are significant legal deficiencies 
and may contain factual errors that 
call into question the very validity of 
the contempt citation itself. 
For example, on pages 4 and 5, the 
contempt citation charges that senior 
officials at the Department of Justice 
headquarters ‘‘ultimately approved and 
authorized’’ Operation Fast and Furi-
ous. However, the contempt citation 
fails to mention that the committee 
has uncovered no evidence that DOJ of-
ficials, including the Attorney General, 
ever 
approved 
or 
authorized 
gunwalking in Operation Fast and Fu-
rious. In fact, the authorization origi-
nated at the ATF office in Phoenix, Ar-
izona, not at DOJ headquarters in 
Washington. 
On pages 16, 17, 19, 20, 21, 22, 25, 26, 
and 27, the contempt citation charges 
DOJ with not producing a series of doc-
uments that the chairman only re-
cently acknowledged the Department 
is prohibited by law from providing due 
to the potential impact on ongoing 
prosecutions. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. CUMMINGS. I yield the gen-
tleman an additional 15 seconds. 
Mr. CONNOLLY of Virginia. In fact, 
he had to amend his own subpoenas to 
delete documents in this very category. 
But his contempt citation has not 
caught up with his most recent version 
of his subpoena. 
tration’s catastrophic Fast and Furi-
ous. The American people deserve to 
know those answers, and the family of 
Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry do as 
well. 
Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. 
CLAY) 2 minutes, a member of the com-
mittee. 
Mr. CLAY. Mr. Speaker, as a member 
of the Oversight Committee, I know 
that the gunwalking operations con-
ducted by the ATF under both the pre-
vious and current administrations were 
absolutely wrong. But the leadership of 
this House is focused on shameful elec-
tion-year political posturing instead of 
the real issue. 
The Justice Department, long ago, 
ended the practice of allowing these 
guns to ‘‘walk’’ across the border, put-
ting communities in Mexico at great 
risk. But the same people who have re-
lentlessly pursued a baseless, partisan 
attack on Attorney General Holder and 
the President have ignored the des-
perate pleas of the Mexican Govern-
ment—to strengthen American gun 
laws and curb the gun trafficking that 
gave rise to the strategy in the first 
place. 
But focusing on the real issue would 
take time away from their playing pol-
itics with their oversight authority. 
Those on the other side of the aisle 
claim to be concerned about powerful 
assault weapons crossing the border 
into Mexico illegally, but how can they 
be completely fine with those same 
powerful assault weapons being sold 
right here in this country legally, put-
ting our communities at even greater 
risk? 
This is nothing more than a political 
witch hunt. The disgraceful posturing 
that I witnessed at last week’s markup 
has been continued on the floor today. 
I agree that it never should have come 
to this, but we are here debating this 
resolution solely because of the major-
ity. They created the scandal and pro-
duced a showdown during an election 
season just to smear an honorable, 
dedicated public servant and to embar-
rass his boss. 
I urge my colleagues to reject this 
nakedly partisan abuse of power. 
Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, it is now my 
honor to yield 1 minute to the distin-
guished Speaker of the House, the gen-
tleman from Ohio (Mr. BOEHNER). 
Mr. BOEHNER. I thank my colleague 
for yielding. 
It’s important for the American peo-
ple to know how we got here and to 
know the facts of this case. 
The Congress asked the Justice De-
partment for the facts related to Fast 
and Furious and the events that led to 
the death of U.S. Border Patrol Agent 
Brian Terry. The Justice Department 
did not provide the facts and the infor-
mation that we’ve requested. Instead, 
the information came from people out-
side the Department, people who want-
ed to do the right thing. 
Clearly, the majority has not taken 
the necessary time to properly weigh 
this very serious charge. Regrettably, 
this deeply flawed and shoddy con-
tempt citation is emblematic of the 
majority’s reckless rush to judgment 
throughout this political prosecution. 
I have been deeply troubled by the 
tone and tenor of some of the very hos-
tile questioning and the utter and com-
plete contempt and lack of respect 
given to the Attorney General of the 
United States. 
When this chapter of congressional 
history is written, it will not be a 
brave, shining moment. It will be seen 
for what it is: a craven, crass, partisan 
move that brings dishonor to this body. 
Mr. ISSA. I now yield 1 minute to the 
very distinguished and always partici-
pating member of the committee, the 
gentlewoman from New York (Ms. 
BUERKLE). 
Ms. BUERKLE. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the chairman for his steadfast work on 
behalf of truth in trying to get to the 
bottom of Fast and Furious. 
Mr. Speaker, Syracuse, New York, in 
the heart of my district, is roughly 
2,500 miles from Rio Rico, Arizona, 
where U.S. Border Patrol Agent Brian 
Terry was tragically shot and killed by 
an AK–47 assault rifle that the United 
States knowingly allowed into the 
hands of a suspected gun trafficker, yet 
every time I’m home, it is the issue 
first and foremost on the minds of my 
constituents. I listen to their calls, to 
their emails, and at our town halls. 
They want to know what happened, 
who knew what, and when did they 
know it. They ask me, they ask Wash-
ington, they ask the Department of 
Justice: How could the United States 
Government, the pillar of hope and 
freedom, have allowed for this, for one 
of their own representatives, one of 
their own good guys, to be so helplessly 
gunned down by a suspected criminal? 
Mr. Speaker, I’m embarrassed to say 
that after 562 days, I still don’t have an 
answer for them. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. ISSA. I yield the gentlelady an 
additional 10 seconds. 
Ms. BUERKLE. Mr. Speaker, I ask: Is 
this the hope that Americans are sup-
posed to believe in out of the sup-
posedly most-transparent government 
in the history of our Nation? 
It is my hope, Mr. Speaker, that the 
district court judge will see through 
the Attorney General’s contempt of 
Congress after it is passed in the House 
today. However, we must not be mis-
taken, even if the Attorney General is 
prosecuted, the case is not closed. We 
must not forget that guns leaked 
through this program claimed lives. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. ISSA. I yield the gentlelady an 
additional 10 seconds. 
Ms. BUERKLE. Mr. Speaker, after 
today’s vote, we must continue our ef-
forts to find more answers than there 
are questions relating to this adminis-

June 28, 2012 
In addition to not providing the in-
formation, the administration admit-
ted misleading Congress, actually re-
tracting a letter it had sent 10 months 
earlier. 
I think all Members understand this 
is a very serious matter. The Terry 
family wants to know how this hap-
pened, and they have every right to 
have their answers. And the House 
needs to know how this happened, and 
it’s our constitutional duty to find out. 
So the House Oversight and Govern-
ment Reform Committee issued a law-
ful and narrowly tailored subpoena. 
We’ve been patient, giving the Justice 
Department every opportunity to com-
ply so we can get to the bottom of this 
for the Terry family. We showed more 
than enough good faith, but the White 
House has chosen to invoke executive 
privilege. That leaves us no other op-
tions. The only recourse left to the 
House is to continue seeking the truth 
and to hold the Attorney General in 
contempt of Congress. 
Now, I don’t take this matter lightly. 
I, frankly, hoped it would never come 
to this. The House’s focus is on jobs 
and on the economy. But no Justice 
Department is above the law, and no 
Justice Department is above the Con-
stitution, which each of us has sworn 
an oath to uphold. 
So I ask the Members of this body to 
come together and to support this reso-
lution so we can seek the answers that 
the Terry family and the American 
people deserve. 
Mr. CUMMINGS. I yield myself 1 
minute. 
I want to say in response to the 
Speaker, we, too, are all saddened by 
the tragic death of Border Patrol 
Agent Brian Terry who gave his life in 
service to his country on December 15, 
2010. 
lege, an action the President de-
nounced as lacking transparency when 
he was campaigning. The Department 
has stood in open defiance of Congress’ 
moral and constitutional obligation to 
conduct oversight of this affair. 
The family of Agent Terry deserves 
to know who approved Fast and Furi-
ous. They have the right to know who 
had the power to stop this program be-
fore he was murdered, and they need an 
explanation as to why the Department 
of Justice took 9 months to withdraw 
their false denial that they had ever let 
guns walk into Mexico. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. ISSA. I yield the gentleman an 
additional 15 seconds. 
Mr. WALBERG. To some on the other 
side of the aisle, it seems fine that the 
people who authorized this operation 
still work within the Department of 
Justice. I don’t agree. They’d rather 
play politics than uphold Congress’ 
right to investigate. 
Today’s vote is about accountability. 
It’s about making sure another 2,000 
firearms don’t end up in the hands of 
Mexican drug cartels. And it’s about 
bringing closure to the Terry family. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
resolution and honor the memory of 
Brian Terry. 
Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
4 minutes to the distinguished gen-
tleman from Maryland (Mr. HOYER). 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, this is a 
sad day for the House of Representa-
tives. It is an irresponsible day for the 
House of Representatives. It is a day in 
which the majority party asked us to 
take an action that has never been 
taken in the history of America—never 
once—holding a Cabinet officer in con-
tempt of the Congress. 
Now, there have been previous con-
tempt citations—some promoted by 
Democratic committees and some pro-
moted by Republican committees. The 
average time between committee ac-
tion and consideration on the floor of 
this House is 87 days; time to reflect on 
an extraordinarily important action 
with consequences beyond the knowl-
edge of anybody sitting here today. 
Now, I want to tell the chairman, 
with all due respect, I think this inves-
tigation has been extraordinarily su-
perficial. I think the chairman has 
failed to call witnesses that could in 
fact give relevant, cogent testimony on 
the issues to bear. That ought to be 
done. That is why I will strongly sup-
port the motion of the gentleman from 
Michigan 
(Mr. 
DINGELL), 
who 
has 
served here longer than any of the rest 
of us and who is one of the strongest 
gun control rights supporters in this 
Congress. 
What his motion says is: let us re-
flect. Let us bring thoughtful judg-
ment. Let us not, every time that there 
is the opportunity, choose confronta-
tion over cooperation and consensus. 
That has been the history of this Con-
gress, confrontation over consensus 
every time, and America is suffering 
because of it. 
b 1500 
But, Mr. Speaker, despite what my 
colleagues have claimed, this contempt 
vote is not about getting documents 
that show how gunwalking was initi-
ated and utilized in Operation Fast and 
Furious. 
Now, the only documents in dispute 
are the documents created after Fast 
and Furious ended and after Brian Ter-
ry’s death, but we pledge to continue 
to find all the answers with regard to 
the death of Brian Terry. 
With that, I yield 2 minutes to the 
distinguished gentleman from Massa-
chusetts (Mr. LYNCH), a member of the 
committee. 
Mr. LYNCH. Mr. Speaker, I would 
add that we have 31 Democrats that 
signed a letter to the Department of 
Justice and to the White House in the 
aftermath of Agent Terry’s death to 
fully cooperate in this investigation. 
However, I rise in strong opposition to 
this contempt resolution. 
While criticism of the Department of 
Justice for oversight of the so-called 
‘‘gunwalking’’ 
operations—conducted 
during both the Bush administration 
and the current administration—may 
be warranted, a finding of contempt 
against the sitting Attorney General of 
the United States is most certainly 
not. 
In determining whether this House 
should hold our highest-ranking na-
tional law enforcement officer in con-
tempt of Congress, let us remember 
that up until last week the majority of 
our committee had been demanding the 
production of documents that our At-
torney General is legally prohibited 
from disclosing and that has caused 
much of the delay here. In other words, 
Mr. Holder would have broken the law 
and likely compromised existing crimi-
nal prosecutions if he adhered to the 
majority’s unreasonable request for 
materials 
that 
related 
to 
ongoing 
criminal investigations, Federal wire-
tap 
communications 
under 
judicial 
seal, and documents also subject to 
grand jury secrecy rules. 
Let us also be mindful that we are 
considering the extent of cooperation, 
or noncooperation, of an Attorney Gen-
eral who has appeared before Congress 
on nine separate occasions, whose Jus-
tice Department has produced over 
7,600 pages of documents to oversight 
investigators and who continues to 
offer significant accommodations in re-
sponse to extraordinary and ever- 
changing requests for information. 
Meanwhile, the majority continues 
to deny any and all Democratic re-
quests to publicly question, under 
oath, law enforcement officials, includ-
ing former Director of the ATF, Ken 
Melson, the head of the very Agency 
that ran the gunwalking operations 
such as Fast and Furious. 
Accordingly, it’s become quite clear 
that what began as a legitimate and 
compelling oversight committee inves-
tigation into Operation Fast and Furi-
ous has deteriorated into an unfortu-
nate example of politics and partisan-
ship at their worst. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. CUMMINGS. I yield the gen-
tleman another 15 seconds. 
Mr. LYNCH. In closing, I urge my 
colleagues on both sides of the aisle to 
oppose this contempt resolution. 
Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, I now yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Michi-
gan (Mr. WALBERG). 
Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, there is 
no joy in today’s action; but the fact 
remains, 18 months after U.S. Border 
Patrol Agent Brian Terry was mur-
dered, the Justice Department has 
failed to hold anybody accountable for 
the mistakes of Operation Fast and Fu-
rious. 
As a member of the Oversight and 
Government Reform Committee, I have 
witnessed firsthand the stonewalling 
by the Department of Justice and At-
torney General Holder. At every ques-
tion, the Justice Department has re-
fused to acknowledge what they know 
about the gunwalking tactics that led 
to Agent Terry’s death. Most recently, 
they have hid behind the President’s 
erroneous claims of executive privi-

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4406 
June 28, 2012 
I ask my friends on the Republican 
side of the aisle—who know me to be a 
bipartisan Member of this body who be-
lieves in this institution and who cares 
about its actions and the precedent 
that they will set—don’t do this. Vote 
for this motion to refer. Give the chair-
man the opportunity he should have 
taken before to have a full hearing, 
calling 
former 
Attorney 
General 
Mukasey, calling the former head of 
the ATF, calling agents who were per-
sonally involved in this proceeding. 
I venture to say that there are very 
few Members who will vote on this 
issue who have read the committee 
proceedings, very few Members who 
have read the minority report or the 
majority report. Yet they’re about to 
take a historic vote to do what has 
never been done by any Congress—111 
Congresses. Do not take this action. 
This is not about Republicans or 
Democrats. This is about our Constitu-
tion, our country, our respect for a Na-
tion of laws, not of men. That’s what 
this vote is about. We ought not to be 
voting as Republicans and Democrats; 
we ought to be voting as Americans, 
Americans committed to justice and 
fair process. 
nothing, and he seeks for nothing. 
Never in my life have I met a man 
more unconcerned with the search for 
the truth. 
I’ve since become even more dis-
turbed by the depth to which Mr. Hold-
er and his allies will sink to stonewall 
justice. 
Yes, this is an unprecedented day, I 
agree with you. But not until now have 
we had an Attorney General have to re-
tract so many statements made to the 
Congress of the United States, the duly 
elected Representatives of the people 
of the United States. 
Let us vote to support this motion 
for contempt. 
Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, may I 
inquire as to how much time both sides 
have. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Maryland has 61⁄4 minutes 
remaining. The gentleman from Cali-
fornia has 111⁄4 minutes remaining. 
Mr. CUMMINGS. I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. 
MALONEY). 
Mrs. MALONEY. Mr. Speaker, the 
family of Brian Terry deserves our re-
spect, our condolences and our best ef-
forts to finish the mission, to put an 
end to gun violence on the southern 
border. But instead of going after gun 
violence, this investigation has gone 
after the man that tried to stop the 
gun violence, the Attorney General. 
Chairman ISSA
has acknowledged 
that Attorney General Holder did not 
know about the gunwalking operation. 
He has acknowledged that the Presi-
dent and the White House did not know 
about the gunwalking operation. Both 
the White House and the Attorney Gen-
eral 
have 
acknowledged 
that 
the 
gunwalking operation was a tragic mis-
take, that it was badly executed, and 
that it originated under the Bush ad-
ministration. 
It was Attorney General Holder that 
terminated the program and requested 
an extensive investigation of the oper-
ation and how it was conducted. And 
the documents that they’re now re-
questing in this ‘‘vast and spurious’’ 
investigation have absolutely nothing 
to do with gunwalking. 
If they were really interested in dis-
covering the truth, the committee 
would have called Kenneth Melson, 
head of the ATF, as a witness. The 
chairman refused 10 different requests 
for a hearing with Mr. Melson—10 re-
quests. 
Republicans have not granted one 
single Democratic witness request in 16 
months. Not one. 
This is not about discovering the 
truth. This is about politics. This has 
become an obsessive political vendetta, 
pursuing a political agenda in a season 
of unusually ugly politics. 
If they were serious about ending gun 
violence, they would do what many 
ATF agents have suggested and put 
some teeth in the law; and that is why 
I authored, with my colleagues, a bill 
to make gun trafficking a Federal of-
fense and strengthen penalties for 
straw purchases. 
nans and all Americans; 115 Members of 
Congress agree that Americans lack 
confidence in Mr. Holder and his De-
partment. Every Member of Congress 
should do their constitutional duty and 
hold the Attorney General to be in con-
tempt today. 
The people of Arizona, California, 
New Mexico, and Texas, who deal with 
the unsecured borders and violent 
Mexican cartels on a regular basis, now 
must also live in fear of these firearms. 
Some have said that these charges 
against Attorney General Eric Holder 
are racially motivated, and I couldn’t 
disagree more. The violent cartels 
armed by our government have no re-
gard for party ID or race. Throughout 
our Nation and, specifically, in Ari-
zona, folks from all political parties 
and all races are now living in danger 
of this lethal violence due to the ac-
tions of this administration. 
Make no mistakes about it, today’s 
vote is to deliver justice and account-
ability for the Brian Terry family and 
the over 300 Mexicans who have died as 
a result of Fast and Furious. Time’s 
up. 
Mr. CUMMINGS. I yield 30 seconds to 
the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. 
HOYER). 
Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman 
for yielding. 
On November 1, 2009, our Speaker 
stood on this floor, outraged about the 
process. We, too, are outraged about 
this process, and let me quote the 
Speaker: 
We will not stand for this. And I would ask 
my House Republican colleagues and those 
who believe that we should be here pro-
tecting the American people, protecting our 
Constitution, not vote on this bill. Let’s just 
get up and leave. 
My colleagues may well follow that 
advice. 
Mr. ISSA. I yield myself 10 seconds, 
and have no doubt that the gentleman 
will walk off the floor. But his motion 
is asking us also to delay, into an elec-
tion, getting an answer for the Terry 
family. I know that is not the wise 
course, and I strongly support that we 
do this today. 
With that, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman from Idaho (Mr. LABRADOR). 
Mr. LABRADOR. Mr. Speaker, I 
stand with a heavy heart in support of 
today’s contempt resolution. It puts us 
another step closer to holding the At-
torney General accountable for this se-
verely flawed operation and his failure 
to cooperate with Congress. 
The Attorney General has not only 
failed to produce all the relevant docu-
ments; he has misled this Congress and 
thereby prevented us from uncovering 
the truth. So how can the Members of 
the minority say that an investigation 
is superficial when we don’t even have 
all the documents? 
When the Attorney General was be-
fore the Committee on Oversight last 
year, I brought to light his historical 
pattern of willful ignorance. I high-
lighted his lack of knowledge when 
under oath. He knows nothing, he says 
b 1510 
I regret that I do not believe this 
committee has followed that. I believe 
that the political motivations behind 
this resolution are clear and pose a 
clear and present danger to this Na-
tion. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. CUMMINGS. I yield the gen-
tleman an additional 30 seconds. 
Mr. HOYER. I want to thank the gen-
tleman from Maryland, my colleague 
and my friend, for his leadership on 
this effort. 
When we vote on this referral, let us 
vote as Americans, as I said, not as a 
partisan issue. You may have the At-
torney General in the future. It’s not 
the question of the party of the Attor-
ney General. It is the question of 
whether or not this Congress is going 
to provide for equal treatment of all 
Attorney Generals and all Cabinet offi-
cers. 
Let us vote for this motion to refer 
and give the committee the oppor-
tunity it should take, and let us vote 
down this motion that should fail, and 
let us vote down these motions for con-
tempt, and let us thoughtfully consider 
the equities of this issue. 
Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, it is now my 
honor to yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from Arizona (Mr. GOSAR), an 
active participant, and from the dis-
trict from which this event sprung. 
Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Speaker, finding At-
torney General Eric Holder, Jr. in con-
tempt of Congress is long overdue, but 
welcome news for the American people, 
and especially for Arizonans. 
As I explained in my recent state-
ment, Mr. Holder has shown his con-
tempt and utter disdain for our con-
stitutional rights, our border, Arizo-

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4407 
June 28, 2012 
This unprecedented contempt cita-
tion is politics at its worst and why 
this body is held in such low esteem by 
the public now. 
Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, I place in the 
RECORD at this time the statement by 
the Terry family regarding Congress-
man JOHN DINGELL’s criticism of the 
contempt vote. 
All we have asked for is the docu-
ments. All we want are the facts, and 
we have been thwarted. Eric Holder, 
Attorney General of the United States, 
the highest judicial enforcement offi-
cer of the United States, has been in 
contempt, is in contempt, and is show-
ing contempt for the Congress and the 
responsibility under the Constitution 
of this important committee of Con-
gress. 
I urge adoption of the contempt reso-
lution against the Attorney General. 
TERRY
FAMILY
STATEMENT
WITH
REGARD
TO 
CONGRESSMAN JOHN DINGELL’S CRITICISM OF 
CONTEMPT VOTE 
On Wednesday, Representative John Din-
gell invoked the Terry family name while 
saying he would not back the contempt reso-
lutions but instead wants the Oversight and 
Government Reform Committee to conduct a 
more thorough investigation into Operation 
Fast and Furious. 
Congressman Dingell represents the dis-
trict in Michigan where Brian Terry was 
born and where his family still resides, but 
his views don’t represent those of the Terry 
family. Nor does he speak for the Terry fam-
ily. And he has never spoken to the Terry 
family. 
His office sent us a condolence letter when 
Brian was buried 18 months ago. That’s the 
last time we heard from him. 
A year ago, after the House Oversight and 
Reform Committee began looking into Oper-
ation Fast and Furious, one of Brian’s sisters 
called Rep. Dingell’s office seeking help and 
answers. No one from his office called back. 
Mr. Dingell is now calling for more inves-
tigation to be conducted before the Attorney 
General can be held in contempt of Congress. 
The Terry family has been waiting for over 
18 months for answers about Operation Fast 
and Furious and how it was related to 
Brian’s death. If Rep. Dingell truly wants to 
support the Terry family and honor Brian 
Terry, a son of Michigan, he and other mem-
bers of congress will call for the Attorney 
General to immediately provide the docu-
ments requested by the House Oversight and 
Government Reform Committee. 
Mr. ISSA. Mr. Chairman, I’m sure 
that the gentlelady from New York 
recognizes that the right of a minority 
hearing has not been exercised, and 
that would have answered the ques-
tions, as they are well aware, about 
bringing Kenneth Melson before the 
committee. That would be their right. 
They did not exercise their right. 
I yield 1 minute to the gentleman 
from Florida (Mr. MICA), the senior 
member of the committee. 
Mr. MICA. I thank the gentleman for 
yielding. 
When the Founding Fathers created 
our government and established the 
committees in Congress, they had au-
thorizing committees and they had ap-
propriating committees. In 1808, the 
predecessor of this committee was es-
tablished for a fundamental reason, 
and that’s to make certain that pro-
grams and funding were properly exe-
cuted and used by agencies created by 
Congress. 
Congress created the law that cre-
ated the Department of Justice. Con-
gress funded the programs that are 
under the Department of Justice. It’s 
our responsibility to investigate when 
things go wrong. And things went 
wrong. An agent of the United States 
was murdered with weapons which 
were funded by the agency that we cre-
ated. 
in court months or years from now and 
with the Department’s providing the 
same documents it’s offering to provide 
today. Let’s end this partisan exercise 
now. 
Mr. ISSA. I yield myself 15 seconds. 
I respect my colleague from Cali-
fornia, as we came in to Congress to-
gether some 12 years ago; but the fact 
is he talked about everything except 
the fact that Congress was lied to in a 
false letter and follow-up statement. 
Ten months went by. We’re only asking 
for the information related to the false 
statements made to Congress during 
that intervening period and nothing 
more. 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. CUMMINGS. I yield 1 minute to 
the gentlewoman from California, the 
minority leader, Ms. PELOSI. 
Ms. PELOSI. I thank the gentleman 
for yielding. 
I commend him for his extraordinary 
patriotism, for his commitment to up-
holding our oath of office to protect 
and defend the Constitution, and for 
recognizing full well the congressional 
role of oversight of all branches of gov-
ernment. I think we all share the view 
that Congress has a legitimate role to 
play in oversight; thus, your com-
mittee has so much jurisdiction, and I 
respect that. 
I think we also all agree—I think we 
all very, very much agree—that we are 
very sad and seek justice for the family 
of Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry. 
His loss is a tragedy for all who knew 
him, for all of us who care about him. 
We offer our condolences to his family. 
So sad. But that’s not what we are here 
to debate, what we agree upon. 
What we are here to debate is some-
thing very, very large because it is a 
major disagreement between the two 
sides of the aisle here—and I’m sorry to 
say that—about what our responsibil-
ities are to the Constitution of the 
United States. The Constitution re-
quires Congress and the executive 
branch to avoid unnecessary conflict 
and to seek accommodations that serve 
both their interests. That’s how the 
Constitution guides us. 
As Attorney General William French 
Smith, who served under President 
Ronald Reagan, said: 
The accommodation required is not simply 
an exchange of concessions or a test of polit-
ical strength. It is an obligation of each 
branch to make a principled effort to ac-
knowledge and, if possible, to meet the le-
gitimate needs of the other branch. 
Mr. Speaker, on the floor today, the 
Republicans in Congress are not mak-
ing a principled effort to acknowledge 
or to meet the legitimate needs of the 
other branch. What they are doing is 
exploiting a very unfortunate cir-
cumstance for reasons that I cannot 
even characterize, so I won’t; but I will 
say this without any fear of contradic-
tion: 
The basic premise that this debate is 
predicated on today is a false premise. 
It is factually not true. In how many 
more ways can I say that? So we have 
b 1520 
Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. SCHIFF). 
Mr. SCHIFF. I thank the gentleman 
for yielding. 
I rise in strong opposition to these 
contempt resolutions. 
I spent 6 years as an assistant U.S. 
attorney, and I have great admiration 
and respect for the hardworking men 
and women of the Department. I have 
great respect for our Attorney General, 
who I think has been a superb Attorney 
General and is a man of great integ-
rity. I, like most Americans, would 
like to know about the facts of Fast 
and Furious, about the problem of guns 
crossing our border, about the horren-
dous violence to the south of our bor-
der. But what we do today will shed no 
light on that. 
What we do today will not improve 
the situation in terms of gun violence 
that has claimed the lives of tens of 
thousands of Mexican citizens and that 
has claimed the lives of an increasing 
number of Americans. What we are 
doing today is simply a partisan abuse 
of the contempt power. Thirteen per-
cent of the American people think 
highly of Congress, and today those 13 
percent are wondering why. What we 
do will cause no injury to the Depart-
ment, but it will cause great injury to 
this House. 
The Justice Department, after pro-
viding 8,000 documents and extensive 
testimony, is now being required to 
turn over privileged materials; and like 
all administrations before it, it has re-
luctantly used executive privilege to 
respectfully refuse to provide materials 
it cannot provide. So now we are here, 
bringing a contempt motion against 
the Attorney General, who our com-
mittee chairman acknowledges was not 
aware of Fast and Furious. They don’t 
expect any documents to show he was 
aware of Fast and Furious. Yet we are 
going to hold this Cabinet official in 
contempt? 
That is an outrageous abuse of the 
contempt power. What will happen 
when this Congress actually needs to 
use the contempt power for a legiti-
mate purpose? Will anyone still recog-
nize it? 
I urge the Speaker to withdraw this 
motion as, indeed, Speaker Gingrich 
withdrew the motion in his day and let 
the parties work it out. We both know, 
Democrats and Republicans, how this 
will end. It will end with a settlement

a debate predicated on a false premise. 
What can that lead to that has any 
good outcome? It is a situation in 
which we have a contempt of Congress 
resolution against a sitting Cabinet 
member, which is the first time in the 
over-200-year history of our country 
that this has ever happened. Again, 
what is the motivation? 
Secondly—and that’s why I quoted 
the Constitution—this motion is not a 
principled effort to resolve the issue. If 
it were, we would not be able to meas-
ure in hours and days, not even weeks, 
the rush—the railroading—of a resolu-
tion of contempt of Congress that the 
Republicans passed last week and are 
bringing this week to the House floor. 
I say this because I took considerable 
heat myself when we brought contempt 
charges against two staff people at the 
White House—Josh Bolton and Harriet 
Miers—41⁄2 years ago. We were asking 
for some papers. We got nothing, as I 
said to my friends, not even a wrapper 
of 
a 
piece 
of 
gum. 
Nothing. 
Stonewalled. Nothing. Yet, at the time, 
our chairman of the Judiciary Com-
mittee, Mr. CONYERS, and our House 
leadership, Mr. HOYER and others, kept 
saying, Find a way. Exhaust every 
remedy so that we do not have to take 
this action of bringing a contempt 
charge to the floor of the House. 
For over 200 days, we tried, we tried, 
we tried to resolve the situation. When 
we could not, we brought it to the 
floor—two staff people at the White 
House—which is in stark contrast to 
the rush of one week to the next for an 
unsubstantiated—not 
even 
factual— 
charge against the Attorney General of 
the United States. 
It may just be a coincidence—I don’t 
know—that the Attorney General of 
the United States, the chief legal offi-
cer of our country, has a responsibility 
to fight voter suppression, which is 
going on in our country; has refused to 
defend the constitutionality of DOMA 
because he doesn’t believe it’s constitu-
tional; or has some major disagree-
ments on immigration, which fall 
under the enforcement of immigration 
law. 
almost unbelievable. Not that what 
they’re saying is believable, but unbe-
lievable that they would say it. 
I say to those who have a doubt 
about how they want to proceed, that 
instead of doing what I said before, 
which was just to come and treat this 
as a resolution before the Congress and 
express my ‘‘no,’’ after listening to the 
unconscionable presentation, I want to 
join my CBC colleagues in boycotting 
the vote when we have the walkout 
after we have the debate over Mr. DIN-
GELL’s motion. 
We all take our responsibilities seri-
ously here, and one of them first and 
foremost is to support, uphold, and de-
fend the Constitution of the United 
States. That Constitution requires the 
Congress and the executive branch—as 
I began—to avoid unnecessary conflict 
and seek accommodation to serve both 
interests, the executive branch and the 
legislative branch. We are not uphold-
ing that aspect of the Constitution 
here. 
I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no,’’ or 
a ‘‘no’’ vote, but to seriously reject. 
Let’s hope that this will not be re-
peated. But I’m telling you, it’s Eric 
Holder one day, and you don’t know 
who it is the next because of the frivo-
lousness with which they treat a seri-
ous responsibility of the House of Rep-
resentatives. It’s appalling. 
Mr. ISSA. As I know the former 
Speaker of the House knows, the Attor-
ney General is being held in contempt 
as the custodian of the records for re-
fusing to deliver them, and not because 
we got to choose how far up or not to 
go. 
With that, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman from Utah (Mr. CHAFFETZ). 
Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, Leader 
PELOSI seriously questioned our moti-
vations here. Let me be crystal clear 
what my motivation is. We have a dead 
United States agent. We have more 
than 200 dead people in Mexico. We 
have more than 2,000 weapons that 
were knowingly and willfully given to 
the drug cartels. More than 1,000 of 
those weapons are still missing. Most 
of them are AK–47s. We have a duly 
issued subpoena that has not been re-
sponded to. 
On February 4, 2011, on Department 
of Justice letterhead, they presented 
the United States Congress a letter 
that was a lie. It took them nearly 9 to 
10 months to provide that information 
and say, Whoops, sorry. That’s not 
good enough. 
This is not about Eric Holder. This is 
about the Department of Justice and 
justice in the United States of Amer-
ica. I would hearken back to the June 
3, 2011, letter that 31 brave Democrats 
sent to the White House. I will read 
part of this. And remember, this is 
about a year ago: 
It is equally troubling that the Depart-
ment of Justice has delayed action and with-
held information from congressional inquir-
ies. 
b 1420 
It may just be a coincidence that 
those are part of his responsibilities, or 
maybe it isn’t. But the fact is is that 
the chief legal officer of our country 
and his staff have to spend enormous 
psychic and intellectual energy and 
time dealing with this unprincipled ef-
fort on the part of the Republicans. 
Just when you think you have seen it 
all, just when you think they couldn’t 
possibly go any further over the edge, 
they come up with something like this. 
It’s stunning. It really is. I don’t mean 
that in meaning it’s beautiful. It’s 
stunning. It stops you in your tracks 
because you say: How far will they go? 
Have they no limits? Apparently, not. 
The temptation is to say: Let’s just 
ignore the whole thing, to not dignify 
what they’re doing by even being 
present on the floor when they do this 
heinous act, the first time in the his-
tory of our country, to bring contempt 
against a Cabinet officer. You would 
think they’d be more careful about 
what they say. But being careful about 
what they say is apparently not part of 
their agenda. 
I know in our caucus there is a mixed 
response to this. They’re acting politi-
cally; we should act politically. We 
shouldn’t vote on this; I want to vote 
‘‘no.’’ I think Members have to make 
their own decision about that. I’m very 
moved by the efforts of our Congres-
sional Black Caucus to say that they’re 
going to walk out on this. Perhaps 
that’s the best approach for us to take. 
How else can we impress upon the 
American 
people, 
without 
scaring 
them, about what is happening here? 
What is happening here? What is hap-
pening here is shameful. What is hap-
pening here is something that we all 
have 
an 
obligation 
to 
speak 
out 
against. Because I’m telling you it is 
Eric Holder today, and it’s anybody 
else tomorrow on any charge they can 
drum up. 
As has been said, the fact is that the 
papers that they have seen, they know 
are exculpatory. That means there is 
no blame on the Attorney General, and 
they know that. That’s why they don’t 
want to bring those responsible for this 
before their committee, and that’s why 
I commend Chairman DINGELL for his 
leadership in the motion that he will 
bring to the floor momentarily, a mo-
tion of referral, so that we can get to 
the bottom of this, so that we can see 
how this happened, so that we can offer 
some solace to Brian Terry’s family, 
and so that we can have some sense of 
decency about what should happen on 
the floor of the House. 
It seems to me the more baseless the 
charge, the higher up they want to go 
with the contempt. The less they have 
to say that is real, the higher up they 
want to bring the contempt charge. 
I have always tried to make it a 
habit of not questioning the motiva-
tion of people. They believe what they 
believe, we believe what we believe, 
and we act upon our beliefs. It always 
interested me that in this Congress 
somebody can bring something to the 
floor that is not true. But if I were to 
call someone a misrepresenter of that 
information, my words would be taken 
down. So I guess that gives them lib-
erty to say anything because it’s in the 
form of a motion. 
Let’s make sure that we all take re-
sponsibility for doing the right thing 
by not letting there be an abuse of 
power, an abuse of this floor of the 
House, an abuse of the time of the ex-
ecutive branch, an abuse of the time of 
a member of the Cabinet who has seri-
ous responsibilities to our country. 
I urge my colleagues to do what they 
want as far as walking off. I myself had 
said that I was coming to this floor to 
vote against this resolution. I thought 
it was so wrong that there was no ques-
tion to take the opportunity to vote 
‘‘no.’’ But listening to the debate, it is

the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets 
Act, and are sometimes referred to as ‘‘T– 
IIIs.’’ 
The use of federal wire intercepts requires 
a significant amount of case-related infor-
mation to be sent to senior Department offi-
cials for review and approval. All applica-
tions for federal wiretaps are authorized 
under the authority of the Assistant Attor-
ney General for the Criminal Division. In 
practice, a top deputy for the Assistant At-
torney General has final sign-off authority 
before the application is submitted to a fed-
eral judge for approval. This deputy must en-
sure that the wiretap application meets stat-
utory requirements and Justice Department 
policy. The approval process includes a cer-
tification that the wiretap is necessary be-
cause other investigative techniques have 
been insufficient. Therefore, making such a 
judgment requires a review of operational 
tactics. Since gunwalking was an investiga-
tive technique utilized in Fast and Furious, 
then either top deputies in the Criminal Di-
vision knew about the tactics employed as 
part of their effort to establish legal suffi-
ciency for the application, or they approved 
the wiretap applications in a manner incon-
sistent with Department policies. 
From the beginning, ATF was transparent 
about its strategy. An internal ATF briefing 
paper used in preparation for the OCDETF 
application process explained as much: 
Currently our strategy is to allow the 
transfer of firearms to continue to take 
place, albeit at a much slower pace, in order 
to further the investigation and allow for the 
identification of co-conspirators who would 
continue to operate and illegally traffic fire-
arms to Mexican DTOs which are perpe-
trating armed violence along the Southwest 
Border. 
* 
* 
* 
*

The ultimate goal is to secure a Federal T– 
III audio intercept to identify and prosecute 
all co-conspirators of the DTO. . . . 
Tracking 
the 
illegally-purchased 
guns 
after they left the premises of Federal Fire-
arms Licensees (FFLs) would allow ATF and 
federal prosecutors to build a bigger case, 
one aimed at dismantling what was believed 
to be a complex firearms trafficking net-
work. The task force failed, however, to 
track the firearms. Instead, according to the 
testimony of ATF agents, their supervisors 
ordered them to break off surveillance short-
ly after the guns left the gun stores or were 
transferred to unknown third parties. Many 
of the firearms purchased were next seen at 
crime scenes on both sides of the border.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. ISSA. I yield the gentleman an 
additional 30 seconds. 
Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Something 
is wrong. There’s just no question. 
Something is being hidden from the 
Congress and the American people. And 
no matter how much is being said here 
tonight, the fact of the matter is we 
aren’t getting the information. 
A Border Patrol agent has been 
killed, maybe two. Hundreds of people 
have been killed in Mexico with Amer-
ican guns that our government knew 
were going across that border. The At-
torney General has not been giving us 
the information. The Justice Depart-
ment has been hiding it from the Con-
gress and the American people, and the 
President has claimed executive privi-
lege. If that doesn’t tell you some-
thing, nothing will. 
Mr. CUMMINGS. I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, I would in-
quire of how much time is remaining. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from California has 61⁄2 minutes 
remaining. The gentleman from Mary-
land has 11⁄4 minutes remaining. 
Mr. ISSA. I thank the Speaker. 
I submit the following: 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
COMMITTEE ON OVERSIGHT 
AND GOVERNMENT REFORM, 
Washington, DC, May 24, 2012. 
Hon. ELIJAH E. CUMMINGS, 
Ranking Member, Committee on Oversight and 
Government Reform, House of Representa-
tives, Washington, DC. 
DEAR
RANKING
MEMBER
CUMMINGS: Last 
February, I joined Senator Grassley in inves-
tigating Operation Fast and Furious, the 
reckless and fundamentally flawed program 
conducted by the Phoenix Field Division of 
the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, 
and Explosives (ATF). As you know, during 
Fast and Furious, ATF agents let straw pur-
chasers illegally acquire hundreds of fire-
arms and walk away from Phoenix gun 
stores. The misguided goal of this operation 
was to allow the U.S.-based associates of a 
Mexican drug cartel to acquire firearms so 
they could be traced back to the associates 
once the firearms were recovered at crime 
scenes. On December 15, 2010, two guns from 
the Fast and Furious operation were the 
only ones found at the scene of U.S. Border 
Patrol Agent Brian Terry’s murder. 
THE FAST AND FURIOUS GUN TRAFFICKING 
NETWORK WAS NOT COMPLEX 
We now know the gun trafficking ring that 
Fast and Furious was designed to target was 
relatively straightforward. It involved ap-
proximately 40 straw purchasers; a money- 
man, Manuel Celis-Acosta (Acosta), and; two 
figures tied to Mexican cartels. Acosta and 
the cartel figures were the top criminals tar-
geted by ATF and the U.S. Attorney’s Office. 
On January 19, 2011, 20 suspects were in-
dicted, including Acosta and 19 of his straw 
buyers. In all, it is believed that the Fast 
and Furious network purchased approxi-
mately 2,000 firearms. An internal ATF docu-
ment dated March 29, 2011, shows that of the 
indicted defendants, only a select few pur-
chased the majority of the firearms, and 
nearly all of the purchases occurred after 
ATF knew that these defendants were straw 
purchasers working with Acosta. These four 
indicted defendants alone illegally purchased 
nearly 1,300 firearms: Uriel Patina (720), Sean 
Steward (290), Josh Moore (141), and Alfredo 
Celis (134). 
THE GOALS OF OUR INVESTIGATION 
A central aim of our investigation has been 
to find out why and how such a dangerous 
AN ORGANIZED CRIME DRUG ENFORCEMENT TASK 
FORCE (0CDETF) WIRETAP CASE 
Operation Fast and Furious got its name 
when it became an official Department of 
Justice Organized Crime Drug Enforcement 
Task Force (OCDETF) Strike Force case. 
The OCDETF designation resulted in funding 
for Fast and Furious from the Justice De-
partment’s headquarters in Washington, D.C. 
The Strike Force designation meant that it 
would not be run by ATF, but would instead 
create a multi-agency task force led by the 
U.S. Attorney’s Office. The designation also 
meant that sophisticated law enforcement 
techniques such as the use of federal wire 
intercepts, or wiretaps, would be employed. 
Federal wiretaps are governed by Title III of 
While the Department of Justice can and 
should continue its investigation, those ac-
tivities should not curtail the ability of Con-
gress to fulfill its oversight duty. We urge 
you to instruct the Department of Justice to 
promptly provide complete answers to all 
congressional inquiries. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. ISSA. I yield the gentleman an 
additional 15 seconds. 
Mr. CHAFFETZ. Nothing’s changed 
in over a year. But I will tell you this: 
Brian Terry doesn’t have answers. You 
don’t have answers. I don’t have an-
swers. I want all the facts. That’s what 
we’re asking for today, the facts, all of 
them. 
Mr. CUMMINGS. I will remind the 
gentleman that all of this started 
under President Bush. 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. ISSA. I would recognize myself 
for 10 seconds. 
The distinguished gentleman from 
Maryland can have an opinion, but he 
can’t have his facts. 
Fast and Furious was an OCDETF op-
eration that began under President 
Obama and Attorney General Holder. 
No ifs, no ands, no buts. And I would 
trust that the gentleman would no 
longer make statements that would be 
less than truthful. 
And I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. CUMMINGS. I yield myself 15 
seconds. 
Again, the gentleman puts out state-
ments in search of facts. 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. ISSA. With that, I yield 1 minute 
to the distinguished gentleman from 
Indiana 
(Mr. 
BURTON), 
the 
former 
chairman of the Oversight Committee. 
Mr. BURTON of Indiana. I thank the 
gentleman for yielding. 
There has been a lot of hyperbole and 
a lot of repetition, but a lot of the 
things that have been said haven’t 
really been factual. So let’s look at the 
facts: 
Brian Terry was murdered. Hundreds 
of people have been murdered in Mex-
ico with guns that went across the bor-
der. The Justice Department said in 
February of 2011 that they had no 
knowledge about this, and then 10 
months later, they admitted they lied. 
Now they said they didn’t know, and 
then they said they did. I don’t know 
what you call that, but to me, it’s a lie. 
Then Chairman ISSA tried again and 
again to get information so we could 
get to the bottom of this, like the 32 
Democrats wanted, and they refused. 
He sent subpoenas; they refused. They 
hid behind this being an ongoing inves-
tigation and they couldn’t give those 
documents. We got a fraction of the 
documents that should have been given 
to us, but they wouldn’t do that. 
ISSA met with the Attorney General’s 
people to try to come to some conclu-
sion, some kind of a resolution of this 
so we wouldn’t have to move the con-
tempt citation; nothing, absolutely 
nothing. 
And then finally, at the 11th hour, 
when we knew that we were going to

plan could have been conceived, approved, 
and implemented. Who in ATF and the Jus-
tice Department knew about the volume of 
guns being purchased? Who approved of the 
case at various stages as it unfolded? Under 
whose authority did this occur? Who could 
have—and should have—stopped it? By close-
ly examining this disastrous program, our 
Committee hopes to prevent similar reckless 
operations from using dangerous tactics like 
gunwalking ever again. Our investigation 
also aims to determine what legislative ac-
tions might be necessary to ensure that such 
a program will not happen again. 
tion a federal judge somewhere in the United 
States that we believe it is a credible re-
quest. But we cannot—those now 22 lawyers 
that I have who review this in Washington— 
and it used to only be seven—can not and 
should not replace their judgment, nor can 
they, with the thousands of prosecutors and 
agents all over the country. Theirs is a legal 
analysis; is there a sufficient basis to make 
this request. 
Assistant Attorney General Breuer failed 
to acknowledge that before a wiretap appli-
cation can be authorized, it must adhere to 
Justice Department policy. Yet, the oper-
ational tactics included in the enclosed wire-
tap application—including abandoning sur-
veillance and not interdicting firearms—vio-
late Department policy. According to Deputy 
Attorney General Cole, operations allowing 
guns to cross the border do indeed violate 
Department policy. In an e-mail he sent to 
southwest border U.S. Attorneys on March 9, 
2011, Deputy Attorney General Cole stated, 
‘‘I want to reiterate the Department’s pol-
icy: We should not design or conduct under-
cover operations which include guns crossing 
the border.’’ 
The Committee understands the limita-
tions of the Office of Enforcement Oper-
ations function. Nevertheless, when pre-
sented with alarming details such as those 
contained in this application, a sensible law-
yer—vested with the important responsi-
bility of recommending to the Assistant At-
torney General whether a wiretap should be 
authorized—must raise the alarm. Senior of-
ficials reviewing the application for legal 
sufficiency and/or whether Justice Depart-
ment policy was followed, however, failed to 
identify major problems that these manifold 
facts suggested. 
THE DEPARTMENT’S FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH 
THE COMMITTEE’S SUBPOENAS 
Our Committee is still entitled to thou-
sands of documents responsive to our sub-
poenas. These documents will undoubtedly 
shed more light on the misguided tactics 
used in Operation Fast and Furious. If the 
Justice Department changes course and com-
plies with the Committee’s subpoenas, some 
of these documents will cover the targets of 
an FBI investigation of the individuals who 
were the link between the drug cartels and 
the Fast and Furious firearms trafficking 
ring. Other documents will chronicle the De-
partment’s response to allegations of whis-
tleblowers following Agent Terry’s death and 
how it shifted its position from the outright 
denial that there was any misconduct to the 
Department’s formal withdrawal of its false 
statement in December 2011. 
Most importantly, as you are well aware, 
we are still waiting for documents relating 
to the individuals who approved the tactics 
employed in Fast and Furious. In his recent 
letter to me, Deputy Attorney General 
James Cole asserted that such documents 
‘‘will not answer the question’’ of what sen-
ior officials were in fact notified of the unac-
ceptable tactics used in Fast and Furious. 
This statement is deeply misleading. We are 
aware of specific documents that lay bare 
the fact that senior officials in the Depart-
ment’s Criminal Division who were respon-
sible for approving the applications in sup-
port of the Fast and Furious wiretap author-
ization requests were indeed made aware of 
these questionable tactics. Cole’s letter goes 
on to state that ‘‘Department leadership was 
unaware of the inappropriate tactics used in 
Fast and Furious until allegations about 
those tactics were made public in early 
2011.’’ That statement is even more mis-
leading and utterly false. The information 
provided to senior officials in the affidavits 
accompanying the wiretaps includes copious 
details of the reckless investigative tech-
niques involved. Senior department leaders 
were not only aware of these tactics. They 
approved them. 
MARCH 2010 WIRETAP APPLICATION STATES THE 
MAIN SUSPECT HAD INTENT TO ACQUIRE FIRE-
ARMS
FOR
THE
PURPOSE
OF
TRANSPORTING 
THEM TO MEXICO 
According to the wiretap application ob-
tained by the Committee, as early as Decem-
ber 2009, the task force had identified the 
main suspect in Fast and Furious (Target 1), 
a figure well-known to our investigation. 
The affidavit provides transcripts of entire 
conversations obtained through a prior DEA 
wire intercept. These conversations dem-
onstrate that key suspects in Operation Fast 
and Furious were running a firearms traf-
ficking ring. In one conversation that took 
place on December 11, 2009, Unknown Person 
1 asks, ‘‘Can you hold them [firearms] for me 
there for a little while there?’’ Target 1 re-
sponds, ‘‘Well it’s that I do not want to have 
them at home, dude, because there is a lot of 
. . . uh, it’s too much heat at my house.’’ 
Unknown Person 1 then asked where he 
could store the firearms and Target 1 re-
sponds, ‘‘[m]ake arrangements with that guy 
[Straw Purchaser X], call him back and 
make arrangements with him.’’ The affidavit 
acknowledges that while monitoring the 
DEA target telephone numbers, law enforce-
ment officers intercepted calls that dem-
onstrated that Target 1 was conspiring to 
purchase and transport firearms for the pur-
pose of trafficking the firearms from the 
United States to Mexico.

NEARLY 1,000 FIREARMS HAD ALREADY BEEN 
PURCHASED, AND
THAT

The Probable Cause section of the affidavit 
shows that ATF was aware that from Sep-
tember 2009 to March 15, 2010, Target I ac-
quired at least 852 firearms valued at ap-
proximately $500,000 through straw pur-
chasers. As of March 15, 2010, twenty-one 
straw purchasers had been identified. Be-
tween September 23, 2009, and January 27, 
2010, 139 firearms purchased by these straw 
WIRETAP APPLICATION OBTAINED BY THE 
COMMITTEE 
The Committee has obtained a copy of a 
Fast and Furious wiretap application, dated 
March 15, 2010. The application includes a 
memorandum dated March 10, 2010, from As-
sistant Attorney General of the Criminal Di-
vision Lanny A. Breuer to Paul M. O’Brien, 
Director, Office of Enforcement Operations, 
authorizing the wiretap application on be-
half of the Attorney General. The memo-
randum from Breuer was marked specifically 
for the attention of Emory Hurley, the lead 
federal prosecutor for Operation Fast and 
Furious. 
In response to your personal request, I am 
enclosing a copy of the wiretap application. 
Please take every precaution to treat it 
carefully and responsibly. I am hopeful that 
it will assist you in understanding the infor-
mation brought to the attention of senior of-
ficials in the Criminal Division charged with 
reviewing the contents of the applications to 
determine if they were legally sufficient and 
conformed to Justice Department policy. 
The information is as vast as it is specific. 
This wiretap application, signed by Deputy 
Assistant Attorney General Kenneth Blanco 
under the authority of his supervisor, Assist-
ant Attorney General Breuer, provides new 
insight into who knew—or should have 
known—what and when in Operation Fast 
and Furious. 
To assist you in better understanding the 
facts, I appreciate the opportunity to provide 
relevant and necessary context for some of 
the information in this wiretap application. 
Due to the sensitivity of the document, indi-
vidual targets and suspects will be referred 
to with anonymous designations. You will 
notice, however, that the individuals re-
ferred to in the wiretap application are well- 
known to our investigation. Although senior 
Department officials authorized this applica-
tion on March 15, 2010, a mere four months 
after the investigation began, it contains a 
breathtaking amount of detail. 
The detailed information about the oper-
ational tactics contained in the applications 
raises new questions about statements of 
senior Justice Department officials, includ-
ing the Attorney General himself. Before the 
Senate Judiciary Committee on November 8, 
2011, the Attorney General testified: 
I don’t think the wiretap applications—I’ve 
not seen—I’ve not seen them. But I don’t 
know—I don’t have any information that in-
dicates that those wiretap applications had 
anything in them that talked about the tac-
tics that have made this such a bone of con-
tention and have legitimately raised the 
concern of members of Congress, as well as 
those of us in the Justice Department. I—I’d 
be surprised if the tactics themselves about 
gun walking were actually contained in 
those—in those applications. I have not seen 
them, but I would be surprise[d] [if that] 
were the case. 
At a hearing before our Committee on Feb-
ruary 2, 2012, the Attorney General also de-
nied that any information relating to tactics 
appeared in the wiretap affidavits. He testi-
fied: 
I think, first off, there is no indication 
that Mr. Breuer or my former deputy were 
aware of the tactics that were employed in 
this matter until everybody I think became 
aware of them, which is like January Feb-
ruary of last year. The information—I am 
not at this point aware that any of those tac-
tics were contained in any of the wiretap ap-
plications. 
Contrary to the Attorney General’s state-
ments, the enclosed wiretap affidavit con-
tains clear information that agents were 
willfully allowing known straw buyers to ac-
quire firearms for drug cartels and failing to 
interdict them—in some cases even allowing 
them to walk to Mexico. In particular, the 
affidavit explicitly describes the most con-
troversial tactic of all: abandoning surveil-
lance of known straw purchasers, resulting 
in the failure to interdict firearms. 
The Justice Department’s Office of En-
forcement Operations reviews the wiretap 
applications to ensure that they are both le-
gally sufficient and conform to Justice De-
partment policy. Deputy Attorney General 
James M. Cole has verified this under-
standing. In a letter he sent to Congress on 
January 27, 2012, he stated that the Depart-
ment’s ‘‘lawyers help AUSAs and trial attor-
neys ensure that their wiretap packages 
meet statutory requirements and DOJ poli-
cies. 
When 
Assistant 
Attorney 
General 
Breuer testified last November about the 
wiretap approval process, however, he stated: 
[The role of the reviewers and the role of 
the deputy in reviewing Title Three applica-
tions is only one. It is to insure that there is 
legal sufficiency to make an application to 
go up on a wire, and legal sufficiency to peti-

purchasers were recovered—81 of which were 
in Mexico. These recoveries occurred one to 
49 days after their purchase in Arizona. 
The very next day, nine of these firearms 
were recovered during a police stop of a third 
person in Douglas, Arizona, on the U.S.-Mex-
ico border. Five days later, Straw Purchaser 
Z bought another 43 firearms from an FFL. 
On December 24, 2009, Straw Purchaser Z 
bought even more firearms, purchasing 40 
AK–47 type rifles from an FFL. All of these 
rifles were recovered on January 13, 2010, in 
El Paso, Texas, near the U.S./Mexico border. 
Although the individual found in possession 
of all these guns provided the first name of 
the purchaser, agents did not arrest the indi-
vidual or the purchaser. 
Though the wiretap application states that 
agents 
were 
conducting 
surveillance 
of 
known straw purchasers, none of these weap-
ons were interdicted. No arrests were made.

CRIME SCENES IN MEXICO 
The wiretap affidavit also details the very 
sort ‘‘time-to-crime’’ for many of the fire-
arms purchased during Fast nd Furious. For 
example, on November 6, 2009, November 12, 
2009, and November 14, 2009, Straw Purchaser 
Y purchased a total of 25 AK–47 type firearms 
from an FFL in Arizona. On November 20, 
2009—just eight days later—Mexican officials 
recovered 17 of these firearms in Naco, So-
nora, Mexico. Another straw purchaser, 
Straw Purchaser Q, purchased a total of 17 
AK–47 type firearms from an FFL on Novem-
ber 3, 2009, November 10, 2009, and November 
12, 2009. Then, on December 9, 2009, Mexican 
officials recovered 11 of these firearms in 
Mexicali, Baja California, Mexico, along with 
approximately 421 kilograms of cocaine, 60 
kilograms of methamphetamine, 48 addi-
tional firearms, 392 ammunition cartridges, 
$2 million in U.S. currency, and $800,000 in 
Mexican currency. 
Once again, although ATF was aware of 
these facts, no one was arrested, and ATF 
failed to even approach the straw purchasers. 
Upon learning these details through its re-
view of this wiretap affidavit, senior Justice 
Department officials had a duty to stop this 
operation. Further, failure to do so was a 
violation of Justice Department policy.

WIRETAP
APPLICATION
DESCRIBES 
HOW
SMUGGLERS
WERE
BRINGING
FIREARMS 
INTO MEXICO 
The wiretap affidavit details that agents 
were well aware that large sums of money 
were being used to purchase a large number 
of firearms, many of which were flowing 
across the border. For example, in the span 
of one month, Straw Purchaser Z bought 241 
firearms from just three cooperating FFL,s. 
Of those, at least 57 guns were recovered 
shortly thereafter either in the possession of 
others or at crime scenes on both sides of the 
border. The wiretap affidavit even shows 
that ATF agents knew the tactics the smug-
glers were using to bring the guns into Mex-
ico. 
According to the affidavit: The potential 
interceptees conspire with each other and 
others known to illegally traffic firearms to 
Mexico. The potential interceptees purchase 
firearms in Arizona and transport them to 
Mexico or a location in close proximity of 
the United States/Mexico border. The poten-
tial interceptees deliver the firearms to indi-
vidual(s) both known and unknown who then 
transport them into Mexico and/or the po-
tential interceptees transport the firearms 
across the border and deliver them to cus-
tomers both known and unknown. 
The fact that ATF knew that Target 1 had 
acquired 852 firearms and had the present in-
tent to move them to Mexico should have 
prompted Department officials to act. De-
partment officials should have ensured that 
the firearms were interdicted immediately 
and that law enforcement took steps to dis-
rupt any further straw purchasing and traf-
ficking activities by Target 1. Similarly, by 
way of example, if Criminal Division attor-
neys were reviewing a wiretap affidavit that 
showed that human trafficking was taking 
place for the purpose of forcing humans into 
slavery, the attorneys should act to make 
sure such a practice would not continue. Ac-
cordingly, Target l’s activities should have 
provoked an immediate response by the 
Criminal Division to shut him and his net-
work down. 
STRAW PURCHASERS HAD MEAGER FINANCIAL 
MEANS 
The affidavit provides details of the straw 
purchasers’ financial records. As of March 15, 
2010, just four straw purchasers had spent 
$373,206 in cash on firearms. Yet, these same 
straw purchasers had only minimal earnings 
in Fiscal Year (FY) 2009. Straw Purchaser Q 
earned $214 per week, while Straw Purchaser 
Y earned only $188 per week. Straw Pur-
chaser Z earned $9,456.92 during FY 2009, and 
Straw Purchaser X did not report any in-
come whatsoever.

These straw purchasers did not have the fi-
nancial means to spend tens of thousands of 
dollars each on guns. Yet, ATF allowed them 
to continue acquiring firearms without ap-
proaching them to inquire how they were 
able to obtain the funds to do so. ATF also 
failed to alert the FFLs with this informa-
tion so that they could make more fully in-
formed decisions as to whether to continue 
selling to these straw purchasers. 
CONCLUSION 
The wiretap affidavit reveals a remarkable 
amount of specific information about Oper-
MARCH 2010 WIRETAP APPLICATION CONTAINS 
DETAILS OF DROPPED SURVEILLANCE 
The wiretap affidavit also describes fire-
arms purchases by individual straw pur-
chasers. For example, Straw Purchaser Y 
purchased five AK–47 type firearms on De-
cember 10, 2009, and surveillance units ob-
served Straw Purchaser Y travel from the 
FFL where he made the purchase to Target 
l’s residence. The next day, surveillance 
units observed Straw Purchaser Y purchase 
an additional 21 AK–47 type firearms, and 
within an hour, arrive at Target l’s home. 
On December 8, 2009, agents observed 
Straw Purchaser Z purchase 20 AK–47 type 
firearms. While Straw Purchaser Z was mak-
ing this purchase, Z saw a commercial deliv-
ery truck arrive at the gun store with a ship-
ment of an additional 20 AK–47 type fire-
arms. Straw Purchaser Z then told FFL em-
ployees that he wanted to purchase those ad-
ditional firearms. Later that same day, 
Straw Purchaser Z returned to the FFL to 
buy them. After Straw Purchaser Z left the 
FFL with the firearms, Phoenix police offi-
cers conducted a vehicle stop on Straw Pur-
chaser Z’s vehicle and identified two of the 
passengers as Straw Purchaser Z and Target 
1. The officers observed the firearms in the 
bed of the truck and asked the subjects 
about the firearms. Straw Purchaser Z told 
them he had purchased the firearms and they 
belonged to him. ATF agents continued sur-
veillance until the vehicle arrived at Target 
l’s residence. 
ation Fast and Furious. The affidavit reveals 
that the Justice Department has been mis-
representing important facts to Congress and 
withholding critical details about Fast and 
Furious from the Committee for months on 
end. As the primary investigative arm of 
Congress, our Committee has a responsi-
bility to demand answers from the Depart-
ment and continue the investigation until 
we get all the facts. 
Sincerely, 
DARRELL ISSA. 
Chairman. 
Mr. ISSA. I now yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman 
from 
Oklahoma 
(Mr. 
LANKFORD). 
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. Speaker, this is 
a truly sad day. This is not stunning, 
as I have heard. This is a deliberative 
process that we’ve tried to work 
through. 
We have a border agent that’s been 
killed. We have hundreds of Mexicans 
that have been killed. And the finger-
prints on all of that go straight back to 
an operation that was done by the Fed-
eral Government. This is a moment to 
get all of the facts, to get it on the 
table, find out what happened, and to 
get it done. 
Now, we started with a subpoena 
process, over 22 different categories. 
We narrowed that down to one. How do 
we get the documents from the time of 
February 4 of last year, when the De-
partment of Justice told us one thing, 
and December, when they said, Oops, 
and changed their story? We found out 
that they had not told us the truth. 
And in that time period when they 
stalled, stalled, stalled, stalled, we just 
want the information on that. How did 
this occur? 
This is essential because Phoenix 
ATF had a plan, Fast and Furious. It 
was then approved by the U.S. attorney 
in that area, and then went up the food 
chain to the Department of Justice, 
where it was signed off. This is not ir-
relevant. It is essential that we know 
the process of how this was done. If 
we’re going to fix this problem, we’ve 
got to know the facts. Instead, they’re 
being withheld. 
Mr. CUMMINGS. I will continue to 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, as a point of 
inquiry, do I have the right to close? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from California has the right to 
close. 
Mr. ISSA. Then I will reserve my 
right to close. 
Mr. CUMMINGS. Does the gentleman 
have any further requests for time? 
Mr. ISSA. No, I do not. 
Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, as the 
Democratic leader said, there is no 
doubt that the Constitution gives Con-
gress the right and responsibility to in-
vestigate. But the Constitution also re-
quires something else. It requires Con-
gress and the executive branch to avoid 
unnecessary conflict and deceit, ac-
commodations that serve both of their 
interests. 
In this case, the Attorney General 
has testified nine times. He has pro-
vided thousands of pages of documents. 
He has provided 13 pages of deliberative

predecessor’s watch and for a very long 
time we have not done a good job of 
overseeing the actions of field agents 
when it comes to guns. 
But, again, we’re here today, for the 
first time in over 200 years, to deal 
with an Attorney General who has flat- 
out refused to give the information re-
lated to lies and a coverup exclusively 
within his jurisdiction. That’s what 
we’re voting on. 
I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on the contempt 
on behalf of the Terry family. 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time 
for debate on the resolution has ex-
pired. 
internal documents, and he is willing 
to provide even more to me, the recent 
demands of Chairman ISSA. 
But House Republican leaders are not 
honoring their constitutional obliga-
tions. In fact, they are running in the 
wrong direction as quickly as possible. 
It is fundamentally wrong to vote in 
favor of this resolution at this time 
when the Attorney General has been 
working with the House in good faith. 
I believe this action will undermine the 
standing of the House, will cement the 
Speaker’s legacy, and will be recorded 
by history as a discredit to this insti-
tution. 
With that, I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. ISSA. I yield myself such time as 
I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, there’s been a lot of 
talk about the documents that the At-
torney General couldn’t give us. These 
documents, 
documents 
under 
seal, 
would be an example of documents that 
we should not see, except in camera, 
and we’ve taken great care to ensure 
that no one outside Members of Con-
gress and key staff have ever looked at 
them. 
But I’ve looked at them, and what I 
know is that these documents, read by 
any person of ordinary learning, make 
it very clear that these wiretap appli-
cations were read and signed by indi-
viduals in the Department of Justice in 
Washington. And if you read them, you 
knew they were gunwalking. People 
will tell you differently. I give you my 
word: You read this, you know they 
were letting guns go to Mexico. They 
knew who the buyers were, who the 
intermediaries were, who the recipients 
were, and, most importantly, where 
they ended up. And there are reports in 
here, as part of the evidence given to 
judges in order to get wiretaps—there 
is evidence that they knew that, in 
fact, weapons had already ended up in 
Mexico. 
That’s before Brian Terry was killed. 
That’s how Fast and Furious could 
have been stopped. That’s how people 
could have been warned. In fact, that’s 
at a time in which ATF agents in Mex-
ico City, if they punched in the serial 
number of a weapon found there, they 
got an erroneous, an error. They did 
not get meaningful information be-
cause that was being blocked—not by 
ATF, per se, but by the Department of 
Justice under the auspices of the U.S. 
attorney and his bosses. 
MOTION TO REFER 
Mr. DINGELL. I have a motion at the 
desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will report the motion to refer. 
The Clerk read as follows: 
Mr. Dingell of Michigan moves to refer the 
resolution, H. Res. 711, to the Committee on 
Oversight and Government Reform with in-
structions to: 
(1) Hold a bipartisan public hearing with 
testimony from Kenneth Melson, the former 
Acting Director of the Bureau of Alcohol, 
Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives during 
Operation Fast and Furious. 
(2) Hold a bipartisan public hearing with 
testimony from William Hoover, the former 
Acting Deputy Director of the Bureau of Al-
cohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives 
during Operation Fast and Furious. 
(3) Hold a bipartisan public hearing with 
testimony from former Attorney General Mi-
chael Mukasey, who, according to documents 
produced to the committee, was informed 
during his tenure that, although efforts to 
coordinate firearm interdictions with Mexi-
can law enforcement officials in 2007 ‘‘have 
not been successful’’, the ‘‘ATF would like to 
expand’’ such efforts. 
(4) Conduct a bipartisan transcribed inter-
view of Alice Fisher, who served as the As-
sistant Attorney General for the Criminal 
Division of the Department of Justice from 
2005 to 2008, about her role in authorizing 
wiretaps in Operation Wide Receiver. 
(5) Conduct a bipartisan transcribed inter-
view of Kenneth Blanco, who serves as Dep-
uty Assistant Attorney General at the De-
partment of Justice and also authorized 
wiretaps in Operation Fast and Furious. 
(6) Take such further actions as the com-
mittee, with full bipartisan consultation, 
deems appropriate to assure a thorough and 
vigorous investigation of this matter. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 708, the gen-
tleman from Michigan (Mr. DINGELL) 
and a Member opposed each will con-
trol 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Michigan. 
Mr. DINGELL. I yield myself 4 min-
utes. 
(Mr. DINGELL asked and was given 
permission to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. DINGELL. I rise to offer this mo-
tion to refer so that this investigation 
can focus on the real issues at hand 
and to get the facts. 
I begin by expressing my respect and 
affection for the chairman of the com-
mittee, Mr. ISSA. I want to see a proper 
investigation and the facts gotten 
about serious misbehavior and utter in-
competence at the Bureau of Alcohol, 
clined prosecutions because of failed 
techniques. 
All of these were shut down during 
the Bush administration. President 
Bush can take no credit for it. He 
didn’t know it. As far as I know, the 
Attorney General didn’t know. And 
anyone who saw the record of that 
should say: This was wrong-minded. 
But during this administration, during 
the time in which the Attorney Gen-
eral and his key lieutenants, including 
Lanny Breuer, were in charge, they re-
opened the prosecutions from a failed 
program called Wide Receiver and they 
opened Fast and Furious. 
Now I’m the second child in a family. 
I have an older brother. I learned at a 
very young age you in fact cannot, 
when you do something wrong, say: My 
brother Billy did it. It doesn’t work 
that way. You’re responsible for what 
you do wrong, whether it happened be-
fore your watch or not. This happened 
on the Attorney General’s watch. 
But that’s not why we’re here today. 
We’re here because when we asked le-
gitimate questions about Brian Terry’s 
murder, about Fast and Furious, we 
were lied to. We were lied to repeatedly 
and over a 10-month period. The fact is 
that is what we’re here for. The Amer-
ican people want to know if you give 
false testimony to Congress. 
The minority leader talked about, 
Why is there such a hurry? Why was 
there a 10-month delay? I was sworn in 
just a few days before this investiga-
tion began, and now we’re nearing an 
election. We don’t want to have this 
during an election. We want to have 
resolution for the Terry family. 
The important thing is, we know 
enough to know that we have people 
who have told us under penalty of 
criminal prosecution—they have told 
Congress and their employees certain 
documents exist. And we’ve asked for 
those documents. And we’ve been de-
nied them. We can’t bring Kenneth 
Melson back in in good faith and say, 
Well, we’ve got to get them in front of 
our committee, if in fact there’s docu-
ments he says exist. And they do, and 
they will not be given to us. We want 
to have those so we can ask the best 
questions. 
You’ve heard earlier that in fact 
we’ve denied somehow due process to 
the minority. My ranking member is 
very capable, and has asked for minor-
ity days; in other words, hearings ex-
clusively for him. He chose not to do it. 
When we were having the local ATF 
and other individuals in early on, all of 
whom worked for this government, he 
didn’t even ask for any. It wasn’t until 
we asked to have the Attorney General 
come in, based on these false state-
ments and final retraction, that he 
suddenly wanted a previous Attorney 
General, who happened to say, No, I 
don’t want to come. So on that par-
ticular day we would have had to sub-
poena him to get him in. I have no ob-
jection to having the former Attorney 
General in. I believe that on his watch 
and his predecessor’s watch and his 
b 1550 
Now you’re going to hear that this 
began under President Bush and Attor-
ney General Mukasey. I’m going to tell 
you that’s just false. What happened in 
previous administrations with some of 
the same local ATF agents was they 
exercised 
extremely 
bad 
judgment. 
They did things and pushed on pro-
grams that I believe were poorly con-
ceived and poorly manned and as a re-
sult they lost track of weapons repeat-
edly. That happened. And it was wrong. 
The U.S. attorney at the time even de-

Tobacco, and Firearms and Explosives, 
called the ATF. This is a tragedy. 
I have had the entirety of the motion 
read so that we can understand what a 
real investigation is. I didn’t roll off 
the cabbage wagon yesterday, Mr. 
Speaker. I chaired committees for over 
20 or 30 years, and I have conducted 
more investigations than any man in 
this particular body. It is clear that 
the events here were characterized by 
dishonest, evasive, and deceitful activi-
ties on the part of ATF personnel. 
I want to find out what has happened. 
This is not the first time I’ve crossed 
swords with ATF and this is not the 
first time I have found them engaged in 
shameful, illegal, and improper behav-
ior. In one instance, I caught them 
raiding the home of an individual. 
They shot him in the brain and they 
pitched his wife, in her underpants, out 
into the hall. 
Operation Fast and Furious was a 
highly 
irresponsible operation that 
never should have occurred. People on 
both sides of this aisle agree to that. 
The American people want the answers 
and they deserve to have a proper, 
thorough, and bipartisan investigation 
that gets them the truth. My con-
stituent Brian Terry wants the truth 
from the grave, and his families asks 
that we get the truth. With God as my 
judge, they deserve it, and they shall 
have it if I can get it for them. 
I have shared scores of investigations 
and hearings over 50 years on wrong-
doing which have collected hundreds of 
millions of dollars wrongfully taken 
from our people and have caught more 
than a few serious wrongdoers, who 
have paid proper penalties for their 
wrongdoing. 
These investigations were always bi-
partisan, with both sides of the aisle 
actively participating and fully in-
formed. The actions of the committee 
were unanimously conducted and sup-
ported by Members on both sides of the 
aisle. What we see before us does not 
follow that model, and it brings no re-
spect to this body. As someone who 
holds the institution here in the high-
est regard, I find this to be most trou-
bling. 
Instead of going after the real an-
swers and getting the facts about what 
happened at ATF, the majority of the 
committee has engaged in what ap-
pears to be a partisan political witch 
hunt, with the Attorney General as its 
target. Over the 16-month investiga-
tion, Democrats were not permitted to 
call a single witness to testify. So 
much for bipartisanship. The American 
people deserve better than this, Mr. 
Speaker. They deserve a legitimate in-
quiry based on facts which all Members 
of this body can support. 
quested, including the former Director 
of ATF during the time of this oper-
ation, are called for a full, open public 
hearing to ensure that the American 
people get the whole story. 
I’m not here solely representing the 
interests of the Terry family. I’m here 
representing the interests of the whole 
country and all of the 800,000 people 
that I serve in the 15th District of 
Michigan. 
As I’ve said on a number of occasions 
in the last year, Congress has two 
choices in their decisionmaking: we 
can work together and get something 
done, or we can play political football. 
I choose to get something done, which 
is why I have offered a resolution. And 
if you have listened to what I had read 
by the Clerk, you will observe that it 
says we want a full, thorough, bipar-
tisan investigation. That’s the way the 
matter should be done. And Members 
on this side will support the findings of 
that investigation if the chairman of 
that committee will permit this kind 
of undertaking to be begun. 
I would observe this very interesting 
fact. The contempt resolution is going 
to give the same instructions to the 
same fellow who is under contempt. He 
will simply put it in his pocket, and we 
will find that this body has been weak-
ened in its dealings with the executive 
branch. 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, I now yield 
all remaining time to the gentleman 
from South Carolina (Mr. GOWDY), an 
experienced prosecutor, to close. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from South Carolina is recog-
nized for 4 minutes. 
Mr. GOWDY. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the chairman. 
This is a sad day, Mr. Speaker, for 
those of us who respect the rule of law 
as the foundation of this Republic, for 
those of us who proudly worked for the 
Department of Justice, for those of us 
who believe the same rules apply to ev-
eryone regardless of whether they live 
simple lives of peace and quiet or 
whether they live and work in the tow-
ers of power, prestige, and authority. 
The same rules apply to everyone. It is 
the greatness of this country, Mr. 
Speaker. It is the greatness, the ele-
gance, the simplicity of a woman who 
is blindfolded holding nothing but a set 
of scales and a sword. 
The chief law enforcement official for 
this country is on the eve of being held 
in contempt of Congress because he re-
fuses to follow the law. He refuses to 
allow Congress to find the truth, the 
whole truth. For those of you who want 
a negotiation, a compromise, an ex-
traordinary accommodation, to use the 
Attorney General’s words, for those of 
you who want to plea bargain, my 
question to you is simply this: Will you 
settle for 75 percent of the truth? Is 50 
percent of the truth enough for you? Is 
a third? Or do you want it all? Because 
if you want all the truth, then you 
want all the documents. 
If you’ve ever sat down, Mr. Speaker, 
with the parents who have lost a child 
the American people deserve, a legiti-
mate inquiry based on the facts. 
It seems to me there’s a simple way 
to resolve this dispute. First, adopt the 
resolution. Then see to it that the At-
torney General produces the docu-
ments that are currently at issue, and 
I will actively support the gentleman 
and see to it that those facts and docu-
ments are presented. 
Second, 
the 
House 
Republicans 
should give a good-faith commitment 
to work towards resolving the con-
tempt fight. If the documents in fact 
are consistent with the Attorney Gen-
eral’s testimony that he never author-
ized 
or 
approved 
or 
knew 
about 
gunwalking, then I think we should 
consider the matter of contempt re-
solved. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. DINGELL. I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, I claim time 
in opposition. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from California is recognized 
for 5 minutes. 
Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 
1 minute. 
I respect the gentleman from Michi-
gan, the dean of the House, but you’re 
just wrong. There were plenty of oppor-
tunities for the minority to ask for 
witnesses. They chose not to except at 
one hearing, and then they wanted the 
former Attorney General. They did not 
avail themselves of the procedures al-
lowing them to have a hearing even 
though they know how to do it and 
have done it. 
But more importantly, when you say 
you represent Brian Terry, you do not. 
The Terry family issued this state-
ment, referring to Congressman DIN-
GELL: 
His views don’t represent those of the 
Terry family. Nor does he speak to the Terry 
family. And he has never spoken to the 
Terry family. 
Secondly: 
His office sent us a condolence letter when 
Brian was buried 18 months ago. That’s the 
last time we heard from him. 
Third: 
A year ago, after the Oversight and Gov-
ernment Reform Committee began its work, 
one of Brian’s sisters called Representative 
DINGELL’s office seeking help and answers. 
No one from his office called back. 
Lastly: 
If Rep. Dingell truly wants to support the 
Terry family and honor Brian Terry, a son of 
Michigan, he and other Members of Congress 
will call for the Attorney General to imme-
diately provide the documents requested by 
the House Oversight and Government Re-
form Committee. 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. DINGELL. I yield myself the bal-
ance of my time. 
Well, I was aware of this. I have com-
municated with the family my sorrow 
at their loss, and my office is setting 
up a meeting with the Terry family as 
soon as I can get back to Michigan.

who has been murdered—and some of 
my colleagues on both sides of the aisle 
have been there—it is a humbling, emo-
tional, 
life-altering 
experience. 
All 
they want is the truth. They want an-
swers. They want justice, and they 
don’t want part of it. They want all of 
it. And I will not compromise, Mr. 
Speaker, when it comes to finding the 
truth. 
Congress is right to pursue this no 
matter where it takes us. No matter 
which administration was in power and 
no matter what the facts are, we are 
right to pursue this. And we are wrong 
if we settle for anything less than all 
the facts. 
To my colleagues who are voting 
‘‘no,’’ Mr. Speaker, let me ask this: 
Can you tell me, can you tell the 
American people why the Department 
of Justice approved this lethal, fatally 
flawed operation? 
To those of you who are voting ‘‘no,’’ 
can you tell the American people how 
the tactic of gunwalking was sanc-
tioned? 
To those of you who are voting ‘‘no,’’ 
can you tell Brian Terry’s family and 
friends how a demonstrably false letter 
was written on Department of Justice 
letterhead on February 4, and where 
would we be if we accepted that letter 
at face value? A letter written on De-
partment of Justice letterhead, that is 
not just another political Cabinet 
agency. It is emblematic of what we 
stand for as a country—truth, justice, 
the equal application of law to every-
one. That letter was written on Amer-
ica’s stationery. That is what the De-
partment of Justice is, and it was dead 
wrong. And where would we be if we 
took their word for it? 
Our fellow citizens have a right to 
know the truth, and we have an obliga-
tion to fight for it, Mr. Speaker, the 
politics be damned. We have a right to 
fight for it. 
I wish the Attorney General would 
give us the documents. I would rather 
have the documents than have this 
vote on contempt of Congress. But we 
cannot force him to do the right thing, 
and that does not relieve us of the re-
sponsibility for us to do the right 
thing. Even if the heavens may fall, 
Mr. Speaker, I want the truth. I want 
all of it. We should never settle for less 
than all of it, and we have to start 
today. 
Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I op-
posed the contempt of Congress resolution 
today because I don’t want political games or 
partisan politics to stand in the way of a seri-
ous effort to find the truth. 
The best place to resolve this dispute isn’t 
on the floor of the House in an election year, 
but in a federal court where both sides can 
present their cases and the debate won’t turn 
into a political circus. 
I’ve been disappointed by the failure of both 
House Republicans and the Justice Depart-
ment to find a practical way to get the Amer-
ican people the full details of this tragedy with-
out compromising existing court orders and 
other national security concerns. An American 
was murdered and we owe it to his family and 
the public to get to the bottom of what hap-
pened. 
Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Speaker, I’ve 
been very disturbed to hear today that it’s in-
appropriate for the National Rifle Association 
to take a position on this resolution. 
It should be clear to everyone that as a 
long-time NRA board member, I take a back 
seat to no one on Second Amendment issues. 
On this resolution, I can tell you that it is en-
tirely appropriate for the NRA to take a posi-
tion. 
We are here today because Congress has 
a duty to hold our government accountable. 
We have a duty to ensure those in charge 
protect the public and the Constitution. Con-
gress was misled when Administration officials 
initially briefed the appropriate Congressional 
committees. The U.S. Attorney General’s of-
fice denied knowledge of a gun walking oper-
ation after whistleblowers reported troubling al-
legations. However, they later admitted certain 
officials with the Attorney General’s office did 
have knowledge at the time Congress initially 
reviewed allegations of gun walking. 
I am deeply troubled by reports the ATF 
forced law abiding gun dealers to do some-
thing they knew was wrong—to sell guns to in-
dividuals they normally would not sell to. The 
Administration designed this outrageous pro-
gram to reportedly reduce gun violence along 
our SW border. And an innocent American 
Border Patrol agent paid the ultimate price for 
this ill-conceived plan. 
There are those who believe that there were 
ulterior motives at play. We already know 
about at least three e-mails from ATF officials 
discussing how they could use information 
from ‘‘Fast and Furious’’ to make the case for 
a new gun control proposal—the Obama ad-
ministration’s proposal to impose a new—and, 
I believe, illegal—reporting requirement on 
dealers who sell multiple long guns to individ-
uals in the southwest border states. The ad-
ministration has defended that rule in court, 
and by their logic there’s no reason it couldn’t 
be expanded to all guns in all states. 
That would be a system of national gun reg-
istration. And that makes this a Second 
Amendment issue. 
We as elected lawmakers must have all rel-
evant facts to hold whoever approved Oper-
ation Fast and the Furious accountable. I 
stand with my colleagues here today who be-
lieve that the Oversight Committee has been 
denied all relevant evidence on who approved 
this terrible operation. The Oversight Commit-
tee’s investigation has been thorough. The 
committee has followed the evidence in pur-
suit of the truth, not in pursuit of a political 
agenda. What brings us here today is the fact 
that this effort has been stonewalled by this 
Justice Department and this White House. The 
American people deserve to know the truth. 
The family of Border Patrol agent Brian Terry 
deserves to know the truth. Members of Con-
gress deserve to know the truth. Today’s vote 
will bring us one step closer to learning the 
truth. 
Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Speaker, it is unfor-
tunate that the House must vote on whether to 
hold the Attorney General in contempt for re-
fusing to produce documents in his Depart-
ment. The underlying facts are disturbing and 
tragic, leading to the death of a Border Patrol 
officer and several hundred people in Mexico. 
The Attorney General should work with Con-
gress to understand what went wrong rather 
than to withhold information and attempt to 
thwart the investigation. 
The power of Congress to investigate and 
conduct oversight of federal agencies has 
been well established throughout our history. 
The late claim of Executive Privilege made 
here, on the other hand, is not consistent with 
precedent or previous court rulings. One can 
only conclude that the Attorney General, per-
haps on the instruction of the President, is try-
ing to prevent Congress and the American 
people from learning the truth. 
Mr. HOLT. Mr. Speaker, the resolution be-
fore us today is an illegitimate, politically moti-
vated smear campaign. 
Never in the history of the House has a U.S. 
Attorney General been held in contempt. What 
makes this resolution particularly outrageous 
is that there is absolutely no basis for it. 
The Attorney General has testified repeat-
edly about Operation Fast & Furious. The Jus-
tice Department has turned over thousands of 
pages of relevant records about this incident. 
None of that matters to the majority. Neither 
does the fact that these kinds of operations 
were undertaken by the Bush administration. 
And the majority does not want the public to 
know that not a single witness was allowed to 
testify before the House Oversight & Govern-
ment Reform Committee about past ‘‘gun 
walking’’ episodes in the Bush administration. 
That’s why this resolution and the Oversight 
Committee’s ‘‘hearings’’ into Fast & Furious 
are not about ‘‘gun walking’’—they are about 
election year politics. 
Rather than dealing with the substantive 
issue of illegal guns and how to reduce violent 
gun-related crime, today we have a political 
stunt that does nothing to solve the problem 
that cost the life of a federal agent. Mr. Speak-
er, the public see this for what it is: a politi-
cally motivated legislative lynching—and those 
who support this illegitimate resolution will 
have to answer for it to the voters. 
Ms. RICHARDSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
strong and unyielding opposition to resolution 
recommending that the House find Attorney 
General Eric Holder in contempt of Congress. 
This unprecedented resolution, which was 
passed out of committee on a party-line vote, 
is nothing more than an attempt by the major-
ity Republican leadership to divert attention 
from its failure to address the real challenges 
facing our country. 
The hard working and hard pressed people 
of the 37th Congressional District of California 
did not send me here to waste precious floor 
time debating this frivolous and partisan reso-
lution. They want us to work together to create 
jobs for the unemployed, make education af-
fordable, health care available, and protect the 
social safety net of Medicare, Social Security, 
Medicaid, and assistance programs to vulner-
able families. 
I oppose the resolution before us for several 
reasons: 
1. The resolution relates to a document re-
quest involving allegations of ‘‘gunwalkng’’ in 
an ATF operation known as ‘‘Operation Fast 
and Furious,’’ but the documents now involved 
are completely unrelated to how ‘‘gunwalking’’ 
was utilized in the operation. 
2. Over the past year, the Justice Depart-
ment provided thousands of pages of respon-
sive documents to the Oversight and Govern-
ment Reform Committee and has made doz-
ens of officials available for interviews and 
hearings, and the Attorney General has testi-
fied before Congress nine times on this topic.

3. The Committee’s investigation identified 
no evidence that the Attorney General or sen-
ior 
Department 
officials 
were 
aware 
of 
gunwalking in Fast and Furious. To the con-
trary, as soon as the Attorney General be-
came aware of the tactic, he put a halt to it, 
ordered an IG investigation, and instituted in-
ternal reform measures. 
4. The House of Representatives has never 
held an Attorney General in contempt. The 
only precedent cited in the Issa contempt res-
olution is a committee contempt vote that took 
place in the 1990’s against former Attorney 
General Janet Reno. That action was so wide-
ly discredited that Speaker Gingrich chose not 
to bring it to the floor for a vote. 
5. During this investigation, the Committee 
refused every Democratic request for a hear-
ing witness, including the head of ATF—the 
agency that actually ran the operation. This is 
not the way to conduct an oversight investiga-
tion unless you are interested in partisan polit-
ical ploys instead of learning the facts. 
Mr. Speaker, I must say that am offended 
that Attorney General Holder, a man of unim-
peachable integrity and one who has served 
this nation with distinction for many years, has 
been subjected to such demeaning treatment 
by some in the majority. Even though Attorney 
General Holder has been forthright and forth-
coming, some in this body accuse him of a 
cover-up or claim he has been obstructive. He 
has even been called a ‘‘liar’’ on national tele-
vision. These unfounded charges are beyond 
the pale and reflect more on those who have 
uttered them that they do our Attorney Gen-
eral, the honorable Eric Holder. 
I oppose this politically inspired resolution 
and urge my colleagues to join me. 
Mr. REYES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ex-
press my opposition to the majority’s decision 
to force a contempt vote on the floor. I want 
to mention the following points for the record. 
There is no evidence that the attorney gen-
eral authorized, condones, or knew about 
‘‘gun walking.’’ Chairman DARRELL ISSA admit-
ted this yesterday before the Rules Com-
mittee. 
There is no evidence that the attorney gen-
eral lied to Congress or engaged in a cover- 
up. Chairman ISSA also admitted this yester-
day. 
There is no evidence that the White House 
had anything to do with ‘‘gun walking’’ oper-
ations. Chairman ISSA admitted this on Fox 
News on Sunday. 
Democrats wanted a real investigation, but 
Chairman ISSA refused TEN different requests 
from Democrats for a hearing with Ken 
Melson, the former Director of ATF—the agen-
cy in charge. 
Chairman ISSA said this yesterday about 
‘‘gun walking’’ operations under the Bush Ad-
ministration: ‘‘They were all flops. They were 
all failures.’’ Yet, he has refused all Demo-
cratic requests to interview Bush Administra-
tion officials about their rules. 
Despite finding no evidence that Attorney 
General Holder knew about ‘‘gun walking’’, the 
Committee has obtained documentary evi-
dence showing that former Attorney General 
Mukasey was personally briefed on botched 
interdiction efforts during the Bush Administra-
tion and he was told that they would be ex-
panded during his tenure. Chairman ISSA has 
refused to call on Mukasey for a hearing. 
Republicans have not granted a single 
Democratic witness request during the entire 
16 month so-called investigation. This has 
been a credible process. 
As soon as Attorney General Holder learned 
about ‘‘gun walking’’, he immediately halted it 
and ordered an IG investigation. 
In closing Mr. Speaker, I think the worst part 
is that the tragic death of a U.S. Border Patrol 
agent is being politicized and used as a way 
to score cheap political points. This is espe-
cially disappointing to me. As a former Border 
Patrol Agent and Sector Chief with 261⁄2 years 
of law enforcement experience on the U.S.- 
Mexico Border, I expect that this body show 
more respect and more focus. 
Instead of using this tragedy as a political 
ploy, this body needs to see this as a learning 
opportunity and a wake-up call. We must take 
action and provide ATF with the needed re-
sources and tools it needs to tackle the issue 
of gun trafficking. I hope that this Congress is 
able to move on to enact the critical reforms 
needed to more effectively combat this 
threat—-and I will gladly work with my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle on that par-
ticular effort. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today to oppose H. Res 708, ‘‘Resolution 
recommending that the House of Representa-
tives find Eric H. Holder, Jr., Attorney General, 
U.S. Department of Justice, in contempt of 
Congress for refusal to comply with a sub-
poena duly issued by the Committee on Over-
sight and Government Reform.’’ 
Holding a sitting Attorney General in con-
tempt would be unprecedented. In our Na-
tion’s history the House of Representatives 
has never held a sitting Attorney General in 
contempt of Congress. 
In 1998, the then Chair of the House Over-
sight Committee led a vote to hold then Attor-
ney General Janet Reno in contempt of Con-
gress. 
Attorney General Reno was also accused of 
withholding documents; however, the then 
Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich elected 
not to bring the Contempt Citation to the Floor. 
Attorney General Reno and House leadership 
were able to resolve their difference without 
holding our Nation’s highest law enforcement 
officer in contempt. Today’s conflict can also 
be resolved without holding Attorney General 
Holder in contempt. 
I firmly believe and I am joined by at least 
65 other colleagues who believe that the Attor-
ney General is acting in good faith based 
upon his actions over the course of the past 
15 months. 
The Attorney General has testified before 
Congress no less than nine times in the last 
15 months and has made himself available for 
meetings with Members of Congress. Further, 
the Department of Justice has cooperated with 
Congressional inquiries into this matter and is 
willing to continue to engage in discussions 
with Congressional leadership and others. 
As of today, the Attorney General has pro-
duced more than 7,600 pages of documents 
as part of 47 separate productions, including 
sensitive law enforcement materials related to 
the pending prosecution of the defendants in 
the underlying Fast and Furious case. 
Attorney General Holder has consistently 
expressed his willingness to find a resolution 
to the issues surrounding the narrow list of 
documents for which he is being cited. 
Holding the Nation’s top law-enforcement of-
ficer in contempt of Congress would be a 
drastic, disproportionate action on the part of 
this body. 
A contempt citation should be an act of last 
resort, after lengthy preliminary procedures, 
negotiations, gathering of evidence through 
other 
methods, 
appeals 
to 
potential 
intercessors and intermediaries. 
Contempt Citations have been extraor-
dinarily rare which is evidenced by the fact 
that the House has declared just four people 
in contempt over the last three decades. For 
these reasons and more we request that you 
elect not to bring the Contempt Citation to the 
Floor this Thursday. 
Mr. Speaker, I delivered a letter to you that 
was signed by 65 Members of this body stat-
ing the same, that this destructive piece of 
legislation should not be brought to the Floor 
today. It appears that this is nothing more than 
destructive election-year politics pure and sim-
ple. It is Republicans following through on 
their threats to use their authority to try to 
damage this Administration, politically, and this 
Attorney General, specifically, who has placed 
an emphasis on enforcing civil rights, voting 
rights and defending our justice system and 
the rule of law. 
This kind of divisive politics hurts Americans 
who want their leaders focused on fixing real 
problems they face every day and hurts law 
enforcement agents who are putting their lives 
at risk in ongoing investigations that could be 
compromised by the Committee’s political fish-
ing expedition. 
Congress has the answers to its questions 
about who designed this flawed operation and 
who authorized it—they just don’t like it so 
they have ignored the evidence they received 
last year which shows this was a tactic that 
was designed and employed in the field and it 
dates back to the previous Administration. 
This Attorney General is the one who put a 
stop to the tactic, called for an independent in-
vestigation and instituted reforms and per-
sonnel changes to ensure it doesn’t happen 
again. 
The Department has made extraordinary ef-
forts to accommodate Congress by turning 
over almost 8,000 documents—including all 
the documents that relate to the tactics in this 
flawed investigation and the other flawed in-
vestigations that occurred in Arizona in the 
previous administration. 
The Department has even turned over inter-
nal deliberative material to answer the Com-
mittee’s questions and the AG offered to pro-
vide additional deliberative documentation to 
resolve the subpoena, but the Committee re-
jected that offer. 
The documents at issue now are after-the- 
fact—they have nothing to do with the flawed 
tactics in any of the investigations dating back 
to the Bush Administration or who designed, 
approved or employed them. 
The resolution relates to a document re-
quest involving allegations of ‘‘gunwalking’’ in 
an ATF operation known as ‘‘Operation Fast 
and Furious,’’ which came to light when two 
weapons involved in the operation were recov-
ered at the murder scene of Border Patrol 
Agent Brian Terry. 
However, the documents now at issue are 
completely unrelated to how ‘‘gunwalking’’ 
there is a question about whether gun-waling 
existed was utilized in the operation. Over the 
past year, the Justice Department has pro-
vided thousands of pages of documents to the 
Oversight and Government Reform Committee 
and has made dozens of officials available for 
interviews and hearings, and the Attorney

the majority party. The only reason this un-
precedented attack is taking place on the 
House floor today, against our country’s first 
African American Attorney General, is be-
cause the Tea Party Republican majority is 
pandering to birthers, NRA members and 
other extremist obsessed with defeating Presi-
dent Obama. 
Attorney General Eric Holder has my full 
support and I reject this transparent political 
abuse of power. 
I am strongly opposed to the House Repub-
lican resolution to hold Attorney General Eric 
Holder in contempt of Congress for failing to 
turn over documents pertaining to sensitive 
and on-going law enforcement activities to the 
House Oversight and Government Reform 
Committee. 
The committee request is for documents re-
lated to Operation Fast and Furious, con-
ducted by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, 
Firearms, and Explosives (ATF), which al-
lowed the straw purchase of firearms in pur-
suit of prosecutions of gun smugglers. Two of 
the illegally purchased AK–47 assault weap-
ons were found at the scene of a gun battle 
that resulted in the killing of U.S. Border Patrol 
agent Brian Terry on December 15, 2010. In 
his effort to cooperate with Chairman DARRELL 
ISSA, Attorney General Holder has provided 
the Oversight Committee with more than 7,600 
pages of documents and participated in nine 
congressional hearings. 
In 2006, under the Bush Administration, the 
ATF’s Arizona office used the tactic of ‘‘gun 
walking’’ to allow guns to remain on the street 
after a potentially illegal sale to build a bigger 
case rather than interdicting them immediately. 
President Bush’s attorney general, Michael 
Mukasey, received a briefing paper on No-
vember 16, 2007 on ATF cooperation with 
Mexico on ‘‘controlled deliveries’’ of weapons 
smuggling. The House Oversight Committee 
has failed to call any Bush Administration offi-
cials to testify on this matter. 
This week, in Politico, a senior Republican 
House aide is quoted as saying, ‘‘The con-
tempt of Holder is a dog whistle to the right- 
wing tea party community, saying that we are 
representing them . . . this is a way to say 
we’re going after this administration, holding 
them accountable.’’ 
Further proof of the blatantly political nature 
of the Holder contempt vote is the decision by 
the National Rifle Association (NRA) to 
‘‘score’’ the vote as part of their legislative re-
port card to their membership. The NRA has 
long championed allowing the proliferation of 
assault weapons previously banned on Amer-
ican streets and sold over the counter, like the 
AK–47s found at Agent Terry’s murder scene. 
This entire episode is a stain on the reputa-
tion of this Republican led House of Rep-
resentatives. It is appalling to know that the 
politics of personal destruction is the top policy 
priority of this Tea Party controlled House. 
Again, I want to state my strong support for 
Attorney General Holder and the Obama Ad-
ministration’s efforts to cooperate with this on- 
going congressional investigation. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time 
for debate on the motion to refer has 
expired. 
Pursuant to House Resolution 708, 
the previous question is ordered on the 
motion to refer. 
The question is on the motion to 
refer. 
General has testified before Congress nine 
times on this topic. The evidence dem-
onstrated that Fast and Furious was in fact the 
fourth in a series of gunwalking operations run 
out of the ATF field division in Phoenix over a 
span of five years beginning in 2006 during 
the Bush Administration. 
The investigation identified no evidence that 
the Attorney General or senior Department of-
ficials were aware of gunwalking in Fast and 
Furious. To the contrary, as soon as the Attor-
ney General became aware of the tactic, he 
put a halt to it, ordered an IG investigation, 
and instituted internal reform measures. 
The House of Representatives has never 
held an Attorney General in contempt. The 
only precedent cited in the Issa contempt res-
olution is a committee contempt vote that took 
place in the 1990’s held by then-Chairman 
Dan Burton against former Attorney General 
Janet Reno. That action became so widely 
discredited that Speaker Gingrich chose not to 
bring it to the Floor for a vote. 
The current contempt debate no longer fo-
cuses on any documents relating to how 
gunwalking was initiated and utilized in Oper-
ation Fast and Furious. Since Republicans 
could identify no wrongdoing by the Attorney 
General, the Committee shifted just last week 
to focus exclusively on a single letter sent by 
the Department’s Office of Legislative Affairs 
to Senator CHARLES GRASSLEY on February 4, 
2011, 
initially 
denying 
allegations 
of 
gunwalking. The Department has already ac-
knowledged that its letter was inaccurate, has 
withdrawn the letter, and has provided the 
Committee with more than 1,300 pages of 
documents relating to how it was drafted. 
These documents show that Department 
staffers who drafted the letter did not inten-
tionally mislead Congress, but instead relied 
on inaccurate assurances from ATF leaders 
and officials in Arizona who ran the operation. 
Despite these good faith efforts, House Re-
publicans chose to move forward with a con-
tempt resolution anyway. 
Moving the goalposts again, the Committee 
is now demanding additional internal delibera-
tive documents created even after the Grass-
ley letter was sent. The Attorney General of-
fered to provide them last week in exchange 
for a good faith commitment to move toward 
resolution of the contempt fight, but Chairman 
Issa flatly refused. When it became clear that 
contempt was inevitable, the Administration 
asserted executive privilege over this narrow 
category of deliberative Department docu-
ments, while indicating at the same time that 
it remains willing to continue negotiations. 
The Issa contempt resolution is nothing 
more than a politically motivated, election-year 
ploy. During this investigation, the Committee 
refused every Democratic request for a hear-
ing witness, including the head of ATF—the 
agency that actually ran the operation. 
Chairman ISSA has acknowledged that ‘‘we 
do go down blind alleys regularly’’ and has 
made numerous unfounded claims, including 
accusing the FBI agents of concealing a ‘‘third 
gun’’ from the scene of Agent Terry’s mur-
der—a claim that the FBI quickly dem-
onstrated to be completely unfounded. 
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, today the 
House is voting on a Republican-Tea Party 
witch hunt intended to destroy an honorable 
man’s character. This resolution of contempt 
targeting Attorney General Eric Holder is a 
shameful and shameless abuse of power by

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4418 
June 28, 2012 
branch. There are those in this body 
who have been here and engaged in de-
bate with respect to important items 
such as the PATRIOT Act and FISA. 
One of the things that we’ve attempted 
to assure our constituents was that we 
would ensure that the constitutional 
rights of Americans would not be tram-
pled upon as we carry out the appro-
priate responsibility of protecting this 
country and our constituents against 
terrorist attack. That requires us to 
provide active oversight over the exec-
utive branch. 
Similarly, in this case, we have an 
obligation to stand in the shoes of 
those we represent, to oversee the oper-
ations of the executive branch—in this 
case, the Department of Justice—to en-
sure that they are following the law. 
Ms. NORTON. I thank the gentleman 
for yielding. 
I have come back from walking out 
of this proceeding to address the seri-
ous, baseless charge of a coverup. No 
one in the majority has been able to 
charge that the Attorney General or 
his top lieutenants knew about the 
gunwalking initiated in the Bush ad-
ministration because there is no evi-
dence of that after 16 months of inves-
tigation. 
This contempt resolution stems from 
a letter from the Justice Department 
correcting the record resulting from a 
prior letter written in the Legislative 
Affairs section of the Justice Depart-
ment that there was no gunwalking. 
That letter relied on statements of 
ATF officials and Justice Department 
officials who this Justice Department 
then fired and did its own investiga-
tion. So what you have is contempt for 
correcting the record. 
What the Justice Department did was 
the opposite of a coverup. But it is al-
leged that if the Department has noth-
ing to hide, it would simply turn over 
everything in its possession. The other 
side has gone so far as to say that when 
the President invoked executive privi-
lege, he too was implicated in a cover-
up. But the Supreme Court itself has 
said that while the privilege is not ab-
solute—and here I am quoting—human 
experience teaches us that those who 
expect public dissemination of their re-
marks may well temper candor with 
concerns for appearances. Thus, Presi-
dents have repeatedly asserted execu-
tive privilege to protect confidential 
executive branch deliberative mate-
rials from congressional subpoena. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. CUMMINGS. I yield the gentle-
lady 30 additional seconds. 
Ms. NORTON. The last leg of today’s 
weak reed of contempt is the claim 
that the President asserted executive 
privilege too late. Why not from the 
beginning? 
The President, like every President 
before him, did not assert the privilege 
until negotiations broke down. But the 
committee proceeded without even ex-
amining the basis for the privilege, as 
prior Chairs of our committee have 
done. A coverup is the most irrespon-
sible allegation of this debate because 
no evidence of a coverup has been sub-
mitted. 
This subpoena is so partisan and po-
litical that I expect any court to do 
just what our committee should have 
done—compel the parties to sit down 
and negotiate. 
Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, it’s amazing 
that people would say there’s no evi-
dence of a coverup when somebody 
says, No, we didn’t do what we did, and 
then hides it for an additional 10 
months. By any normal American 
standard, that would be a coverup. 
With that, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman 
from 
Texas 
(Mr. 
FARENTHOLD). 
Mr. FARENTHOLD. I thank the chair 
for yielding.

COMMITTEE 
ON 
OVERSIGHT 
AND 
GOVERNMENT 
REFORM TO INITIATE OR INTER-
VENE IN JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS 
TO 
ENFORCE 
CERTAIN 
SUB-
POENAS 
Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to 
House Resolution 708, I call up the res-
olution (H. Res. 706) authorizing the 
Committee on Oversight and Govern-
ment Reform to initiate or intervene in 
judicial proceedings to enforce certain 
subpoenas. 
The Clerk read the title of the resolu-
tion. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
BASS of New Hampshire). Pursuant to 
House Resolution 708, the resolution is 
considered read. 
The text of the resolution is as fol-
lows: 
H. RES. 706 
Resolved, That the Chairman of the Com-
mittee on Oversight and Government Reform 
is authorized to initiate or intervene in judi-
cial proceedings in any Federal court of com-
petent jurisdiction, on behalf of the Com-
mittee on Oversight and Government Re-
form, to seek declaratory judgments affirm-
ing the duty of Eric H. Holder, Jr., Attorney 
General, U.S. Department of Justice, to com-
ply with any subpoena that is a subject of 
the resolution accompanying House Report 
112–546 issued to him by the Committee as 
part of its investigation into the United 
States Department of Justice operation 
known as ‘‘Fast and Furious’’ and related 
matters, and to seek appropriate ancillary 
relief, including injunctive relief. 
SEC. 2. The Committee on Oversight and 
Government Reform shall report as soon as 
practicable to the House with respect to any 
judicial proceedings which it initiates or in 
which it intervenes pursuant to this resolu-
tion. 
SEC. 3. The Office of General Counsel of the 
House of Representatives shall, at the au-
thorization of the Speaker, represent the 
Committee on Oversight and Government 
Reform in any litigation pursuant to this 
resolution. In giving that authorization, the 
Speaker shall consult with the Bipartisan 
Legal Advisory Group established pursuant 
to clause 8 of rule II. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from California (Mr. ISSA) and 
the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. 
CUMMINGS) each will control 10 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 min-
utes to the gentleman from California 
(Mr. LUNGREN). 
Mr. DANIEL E. LUNGREN of Cali-
fornia. Mr. Speaker, we’ve just had a 
very important vote and some would 
ask what this second vote is about. 
This second vote is a simple author-
ization for the committee involved to 
be able to essentially hire counsel that 
would allow us to go into court to seek 
a declaratory judgment by the Federal 
court to enforce the subpoenas that 
have been presented by this committee 
to the Attorney General of the United 
States. It’s a simple, straightforward 
resolution. 
Why is it important? One of our obli-
gations under the Constitution is to 
provide oversight of the executive 
b 1650 
One manner in which that can be 
frustrated is by a department—in this 
case, the Department of Justice—that 
refuses to respond to lawful subpoenas 
and give us the information so that we 
can do that oversight. That is what we 
were talking about. 
This Congress, this House of Rep-
resentatives, was misled. I don’t know 
whether it was intentional or not. I do 
know we were misled by a representa-
tion from the Justice Department in an 
official response to an inquiry by the 
Congress of the United States. That 
was not corrected for 10 months. 
You can look at it a couple of ways. 
One is that there was an attempt to 
slow-walk the Congress so that it could 
not carry out its constitutional respon-
sibility. There is a lot of talk on this 
floor by both Democrats and Repub-
licans as to how we have an obligation 
to oversee the executive branch. In 
fact, one of the genius points of our 
Founding Fathers’ Constitution is that 
conflict between or among the three 
branches of government, that natural 
tension. But that natural tension can-
not exist and we cannot do that which 
we are called upon under the Constitu-
tion to do faithfully if we are denied in-
formation to oversee the operations of 
the Department of Justice. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. ISSA. I yield the gentleman an 
additional 30 seconds. 
Mr. DANIEL E. LUNGREN of Cali-
fornia. So all we are doing simply is 
asking for the authorization so that 
this committee can have the represen-
tation of counsel to see that these sub-
poenas are carried out. Since we have 
been given every sense from the Jus-
tice Department that it would be folly, 
in a sense, to suggest that they would 
carry out the actions that we just 
voted upon against the Attorney Gen-
eral, this is the method by which we 
can achieve that which we are required 
to do; that is, to carry out oversight re-
sponsibility against the executive de-
partment, including the Department of 
Justice. 
Mr. CUMMINGS. I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentlelady from the District of Co-
lumbia (Ms. NORTON).

for failing to respond to more sub-
poenas, the Speaker should articulate 
with clarity what general purpose will 
be served by the response. If nothing 
legitimately useful is to be learned nor 
any 
legislative 
purpose 
is 
to 
be 
achieved with continued responses to 
these subpoenas, then it is time for the 
Attorney General to get back to work, 
along with the Members of the House. 
Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, I’m not sure 
if I heard the gentleman right when he 
said that I ‘‘silenced whistleblowers’’ 
in order to keep them from talking 
about gun control. 
Is the gentleman disparaging and 
falsely claiming that I did something 
that I know for a fact I did not? 
Mr. CUMMINGS. Will the gentleman 
yield? 
Mr. ISSA. Of course. 
Mr. CUMMINGS. I will tell you what 
you did. When you called the whistle-
blowers in, and the whistleblowers, 
who are ATF agents, and you know 
this— 
Mr. ISSA. Reclaiming my time, it’s 
pretty clear you are disparaging me, 
and you are disparaging me by making 
a claim that’s untrue. 
The bottom line is, in committee, 
witnesses were told that they need not 
answer questions that were not the 
subject of the hearing and, in fact, 
those witnesses were allowed and did 
answer questions by the minority hav-
ing to do with gun control, an issue 
they prefer to talk about rather than 
the cause of Brian Terry’s death. 
With that, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. MCCAUL). 
Terry family, the families of the Mexi-
can people who have been slain, and 
the American people deserve no less. 
Mr. CUMMINGS. I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentleman from Texas (Mr. REYES). 
Mr. REYES. It is indeed a sad day 
today. As an officer that spent 261⁄2 
years wearing the United States Border 
Patrol uniform, it is regrettable for me 
today that we’re here under these cir-
cumstances. 
I want to acknowledge and thank the 
chairman and the ranking member for 
inviting me to go with them to Mexico 
City and visit at the U.S. Embassy 
about the circumstances around what 
led to the investigation of Fast and Fu-
rious. And to me, it’s regrettable be-
cause we are here discussing the death 
of a Border Patrol agent. I went to the 
memorial 
service 
for 
Agent 
Brian 
Terry. I visited with his mom and his 
family that day. I went there because 
as a former Border Patrol agent I 
wanted to express sympathy and sup-
port, as I did so many times as a chief 
for agents that were killed in the line 
of duty. 
So for me, it is particularly troubling 
that we’re here politicizing the death 
of a United States Border Patrol agent. 
We ought to be about getting to the 
circumstances of the investigation led 
under a U.S. Attorney under OCDETF. 
Both the ranking member and the 
chairman know that that was the con-
trolling entity in this case. 
I don’t know except to say that it’s 
pure basic politics that we’ve now spun 
this up to the level of the Attorney 
General. Having had the experience to 
supervise my agents that were part of 
OCDETF investigations and having had 
a number of conversations with my 
friends on the other side of the aisle 
who were experienced prosecutors, ev-
erybody here that has that experience 
knows that those controls don’t go up 
to the level of the Attorney General. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. CUMMINGS. I yield the gen-
tleman an additional 30 seconds. 
Mr. REYES. So we’re here taking a 
lot of time when we should be dis-
cussing things that are a priority to 
the American people. We’re here under 
the worst of circumstances for the 
Terry family, which all they want is 
closure on the death of a son, on the 
death of a patriotic American citizen, 
and spinning it in a political sense. 
I really think that this is a sad day 
for this House of Representatives, and 
we ought to do better for the American 
people. 
Mr. ISSA. I yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman from Idaho (Mr. LABRADOR). 
Mr. LABRADOR. Mr. Speaker, once 
again I sit here and I’m amazed by the 
language that is being used. We’ve had 
numerous hearings. We’ve had numer-
ous investigations. We’ve had a lot of 
people come before Congress and give 
us false information. And the reality is 
that I hear again and again from the 
other side that there is no evidence of 
coverup; there is no evidence of cover-
up. 
I rise today in support of the motion 
for civil contempt so we can get an at-
torney to proceed. 
Normally under contempt, what hap-
pens is, we vote, like we just did, to 
hold someone in contempt, and it’s 
turned over to the Department of Jus-
tice—in fact, the U.S. attorney for the 
District of Columbia—to pursue in dis-
trict court. Unfortunately, the U.S. at-
torney is an employee and reports to 
the Attorney General, who was just 
found in contempt. And I am concerned 
that 
past 
history 
of 
stonewalling 
delays that are associated with getting 
us information and cooperating with us 
on Fast and Furious will continue and, 
in fact, there will be no prosecution of 
the contempt resolution we just voted 
out. So it is absolutely critical that 
the committee be given the authority 
to pursue this on their own if the Jus-
tice Department is not responsive. 
I, therefore, urge all of my colleagues 
to join me in support of this civil con-
tempt resolution. 
Mr. CUMMINGS. I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. 
SCOTT). 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. I thank the 
gentleman for yielding. 
The 
contempt 
citation 
pending 
against Attorney General Holder is un-
founded, unfair, and unwise. All of this 
involves questions about gunwalking. 
And we know that the Attorney Gen-
eral has handed over thousands of doc-
uments in response to multiple sub-
poenas. 
So 
we 
know 
that 
the 
gunwalking policy began under the 
Bush administration. We know that 
President Bush’s Attorney General, Mi-
chael Mukasey, was briefed on the pol-
icy, and it continued. We know that 
when Attorney General Holder found 
out about it, he shut the program down 
and called for an investigation. 
If we want to know why the policy 
started, we should ask officials who 
served when it started during the Bush 
administration. If we want to know 
what Attorney General Holder knew 
about Fast and Furious, we should call 
the former Acting Director of the ATF, 
Ken Melson, who is on the record as 
saying that he would have been the one 
to have informed the Attorney Gen-
eral, but even he didn’t know about 
Fast and Furious. But unfortunately, 
requests from the Democratic members 
of the House Committee on Oversight 
and Government Reform to call these 
witnesses have been rejected. 
At this point, there has been no ar-
ticulation of any useful information 
about the origins of gunwalking in 
Fast and Furious or the death of Agent 
Brian Terry that can be learned from 
the narrow set of documents still at 
issue, nor has there been any articula-
tion of any legitimate legislative pur-
pose that can be achieved. And, in fact, 
Chairman ISSA
has silenced whistle-
blowers who testified about legislation 
to strengthen law enforcement tools on 
our southwestern boarder. 
If the Speaker now insists on holding 
Attorney General Holder in contempt 
b 1700 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, as a 
former Federal prosecutor at the De-
partment of Justice, I do not take 
these proceedings lightly. Above all, 
those at the Department cherish their 
integrity. Mr. Speaker, that integrity 
has now been impugned. 
This is not about politics. It’s about 
pursuit of the truth and justice. The 
definition of contempt is the willful 
disobedience to or open disrespect for 
the rules or orders of a court or legisla-
tive body. This definition falls squarely 
within the facts here. 
When insiders revealed the govern-
ment’s role in Operation Fast and Furi-
ous, the Department of Justice falsely 
told 
Congress 
that 
whistleblowers 
weren’t telling the truth. As Congress 
fulfilled its oversight obligations and 
tried to get to the bottom of how guns 
were put in the hands of Mexican drug 
cartels, ultimately killing Border Pa-
trol Brian Terry, this administration 
refused to turn over crucial documents 
that would shed light on this. Instead, 
they asserted executive privilege at the 
eleventh hour, calling into question 
the validity of the privilege itself and 
at the same time demonstrating that 
communications were held at the high-
est levels in the government. In fact, 
the wiretaps, we all know, are approved 
at Main Justice. 
Mr. Speaker, this Attorney General 
needs to be held accountable. The

sure; we’re checking on it—happened in 
this House already today, something 
that may have interfered with the trial 
already. 
So as I close, I would submit that he 
has done the very best that he could, 
and now we need to meet him halfway. 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 
such time as I may consume. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from California is recognized 
for 13⁄4 minutes. 
Mr. ISSA. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
It’s been a long day for America, but 
it’s been a longer day for the Terry 
family. I’m going to urge everyone to 
vote for the ability to hire counsel, and 
that’s what the last vote is, and I be-
lieve it will pass overwhelmingly. 
But I’m going to use this time to 
pledge to the America people, to pledge 
to the Terry family, and to pledge to 
my colleagues: this investigation has 
in fact been brought to a halt in one 
area—and the area is the Attorney 
General’s flat refusal to any longer co-
operate with this committee.

But the reality is that we have only 
received 5 percent of the documents 
that we have requested. There is no 
way for us to know exactly what hap-
pened, who knew, and what did they 
know, unless we receive all of the docu-
ments. All we’re asking the Attorney 
General to do is to provide the docu-
ments that we have requested. We 
wouldn’t be standing here holding 
these contempt proceedings if he had 
given us the documents. And that’s 
why I ask everybody in this body to ac-
tually vote for contempt. 
Mr. CUMMINGS. May I inquire as to 
how much time is left. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Maryland has 3 minutes 
remaining, and the gentleman from 
California has 13⁄4 minutes remaining. 
Mr. CUMMINGS. I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. ISSA. Reserving the right to 
close, I have no further requests for 
time. 
Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, it’s in-
teresting here today, what we just did 
with regard to the criminal contempt. 
I do believe that it is very unfortunate, 
and let me tell you why. We have an 
Attorney General who is indeed an 
honorable man. We who practice law 
look up to the Attorney General and 
any U.S. Attorney. They are folks like 
us who are well educated and who love 
their country. And Eric Holder, Jr., is 
no exception. 
Over and over again, he has tried to 
cooperate with this committee. And 
I’m sure that both sides—his side and 
our side—have become a little frus-
trated at times. But as he said in a 
meeting a couple of weeks ago, he said 
that he’s willing to give the docu-
ments, but he was asking that at some 
point his attorneys have an oppor-
tunity to get back to work. 
Now, Leader PELOSI said something a 
moment ago that we should not lose 
sight of, Mr. Speaker, when she spoke 
about the Constitution and that it re-
quires Congress and the executive 
branch to avoid unnecessary conflicts 
and to seek accommodations that serve 
both of their interests. In the words of 
Attorney 
General 
William 
French 
Smith, under President Reagan: 
It is the obligation of each branch to make 
a principled effort to acknowledge and, if 
possible, to meet the legitimate needs of the 
other branch. 
I believe that this Attorney General 
has bent over backwards trying to ac-
commodate us, trying to provide the 
information, but at the same time, as 
he has said to us many times, to pro-
tect the institution of the Attorney 
General of the United States. And 
when I say protect the institution, I 
mean protect the institution, the same 
types of things that have assertions of 
executive privilege, making sure that 
wiretap applications are not made pub-
lic, making sure that confidential in-
formants are not disclosed, making 
sure that ongoing investigations are 
not interfered with. 
And I’m not sure, but there may be 
something that happened—we’re not 
b 1710 
But it doesn’t change the fact that in 
the days and weeks to come, we will 
use what we can in the way of other 
tools, including some of the individuals 
that the minority has talked about 
today, to glean additional information, 
to find ways to prove accountability 
for the many people that had to be in-
volved in this OCDETF operation in 
order for those guns to walk. We will 
continue to do that. We will try to find 
the truth. 
Hopefully in the weeks to come, we 
also will begin getting cooperation 
from the administration again. But if 
we don’t, I will tell the ranking mem-
ber here today, it has always been my 
intention to look backwards to pre-
vious gunwalking programs that we be-
lieve were certainly poorly designed 
and resulted in weapons getting out of 
the hands of lawful people and into the 
hands of criminal elements. That’s not 
going to change. It’s not going to 
change because it’s our obligation to 
investigate and because this one we 
cannot let loose until the Terry family 
has been kept a promise that the rank-
ing member and I both made. 
So I take the ranking member at his 
word today that, in fact, he will not 
rest until we get some answers, and I 
commit the same that I will not, and I 
urge the passage of this resolution. 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time 
for debate has expired. 
Pursuant to House Resolution 708,

This issue of health care reform is 
one of the defining issues in our coun-
try, and it’s one that we finally grap-
pled with in 2010 to come up with a bill 
that not everyone agreed with. As a 
matter of fact, as Mr. ELLISON will re-
member, I didn’t agree with this. I was 
not satisfied with health care reform 
within the context of a for-profit sys-
tem because I wanted a not-for-profit 
system. Yet, while we had a for-profit 
system, one of the things we needed to 
do was to make sure children with pre-
existing conditions would be covered; 
to make sure all of these lifetime caps 
on the amount of money that people 
could claim for expenses were removed; 
and to make sure that people were 
given a fighting chance with the insur-
ance companies.

THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT IS 
THE LAW OF THE LAND 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE of Texas asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE of Texas. I rise 
today because this is a great country. 
In fact, I would call it the greatest 
country in the world. 
Throughout my life’s history, al-
though we have traveled mountains 
and low valleys, I have been equal and 
unequal in this Nation. Yet today I feel 
as tall as the pine trees because our 
Supreme Court shed itself of diverse 
and sometimes divisive bickering and 
upheld the Constitution of the United 
States. 
It granted to the American people af-
fordable health care. It granted to the 
sickest of the sick the opportunity to 
be covered by insurance. It granted to 
seniors who fall into doughnut holes 
and who have to choose prescription 
drugs over food a relief line. It granted 
to hospitals that take in indigent pa-
tients who may otherwise die on side-
walks in America an opportunity to 
take care of those patients. It gave 
children with preexisting diseases an 
opportunity to live fully in this coun-
try. 
So now the Affordable Care Act is the 
law of the land. We have been vindi-
cated. Every single, single vote of 
those Members who have lost and of 
those who have won, we’ve been vindi-
cated. Thank God for the United States 
Supreme Court. 
THE PROGRESSIVE MESSAGE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 5, 2011, the gentleman from Min-
nesota (Mr. ELLISON) is recognized for 
60 minutes as the designee of the mi-
nority leader. 
Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Speaker, my name 
is KEITH ELLISON, and I claim this Spe-
cial Order time on behalf of the Pro-
gressive Caucus. I am very pleased to 
be joined by my dear friend from the 
great State of Ohio, Mr. DENNIS KUCI-
NICH. 
The Progressive Caucus has a Web 
site we refer people to, which is 
cpc.grijalva.house.gov. I urge every-
body to check it out because it has a 
lot of excellent information. 
This we call The Progressive Mes-
sage. Today, we are going to focus on 
three topics, Mr. Speaker. They will be 
in the areas of: (1) historic health care; 
(2) the travesty of justice perpetuated 
on Eric Holder; (3) the voter ID issue 
that is proliferating across the coun-
try, that of trying to restrict and sup-
press the votes of Americans. So that’s 
our Progressive Message for today. 
I want to introduce the first subject 
by saying that today was a historic 
day. The historic health care bill was 
passed many, many months ago; but 
until the Supreme Court of the United 
States said that this bill was constitu-
tional, that this act was constitu-
tional, it was always in jeopardy of 
being overturned. In the Progressive 
Caucus, many of us were signatories 
and cosponsors of H.R. 676, which is the 
single-payer bill—or health care for all 
and Medicare for all. 
Personally, I think today is a dra-
matic step forward in the quest to 
make sure that all Americans are cov-
ered and can go to a doctor. This is a 
very important step—it’s an advance— 
so I’m happy to see it. 
With that, I would like to just turn 
some time over to the gentleman from 
Ohio for any comments he may care to 
make about the health care bill or 
about the Supreme Court decision. 
I yield to the gentleman from Ohio. 
Mr. KUCINICH. I want to thank the 
gentleman from Minnesota, Congress-
man ELLISON, for his leadership in the 
Progressive Caucus and to thank him 
for yielding me some time to talk 
about this momentous decision by the 
Supreme Court. First of all, a little bit 
of context. 
I represent Cleveland, Ohio. There 
are many people in Cleveland who are 
uninsured. There are many people in 
Cleveland who could not afford health 
care. There are many people who are 
working who can’t get their families 
covered. 
b 1750 
What’s happened is the Affordable 
Care Act finally took a step in the di-
rection of reform. It’s an important 
step, and the Supreme Court has said 
you can do that under Congress’ taxing 
authority, but it’s just a step. 
All of us understand that there are 
still millions of Americans who are 
finding health care out of reach, even 
with the help that the Affordable Care 
Act offers. That’s why at the State 
level there are still States, such as 
Vermont, that are looking at how they 
can go forward with a single-payer plan 
within their State. 
Mr. ELLISON. Let me just ask the 
gentleman a question. 
You had an amendment that we were 
trying to move onto the Affordable 
Care Act which would allow States, if 
they chose to, to pursue alternatives 
like a single-payer system. 
Do you recall your amendment? 
Mr. KUCINICH. Keep in mind that 
the Employee Retirement Income Se-
curity 
Act 
essentially 
would 
stop 
States from going forward, so we asked 
basically for a waiver of that. The 
amendment would have provided for a 
waiver so States would have no legal 
bar to pursue a single-payer system. 
That was essentially passed in com-
mittee and then stripped out. 
The point is we can enable it. Con-
gress can facilitate that. The passage 
of affordable care, plus the Supreme 
Court saying Congress can move on 
health care, Congress can take a step, 
finally puts us in a position where we 
can elevate health care to the highest 
level of public concern. 
Every American who is out there to-
night who’s worried about whether 
they would be able to get access to af-
fordable health care suddenly realizes 
that it is possible. For those poor peo-
ple across America who are wondering 
whether they are going to be shut out 
by one aspect of the Supreme Court de-
cision, now it’s up to the States to re-
affirm the position of the State in the 
life of their citizens by saying, if you’re 
a poor person, we’re not going to use 
the Supreme Court decision to block 
you from having access to the re-
sources of the government with respect 
to health care.

are literally chained or tied to their 
job because they have health care 
there. If they want to leave, if they 
want to pursue a different course, they 
want to improve, they can’t, because 
they are tied to their job because of 
health care. They can’t get it. 
Today, the Supreme Court said that 
what this House did with the Afford-
able Health Care Act is constitutional. 
It is constitutional. It is possible for 
us. As we just heard from Mr. KUCINICH, 
it is possible for us to reform the 
health care system. 
My thoughts are so happy for Amer-
ica, so happy for that man that I saw 5 
years ago that was on his deathbed, 
and he said, If I can just live another 5 
months, I’ll be on Medicare and I can 
get the treatments that I need without 
bankrupting my family. Today he prob-
ably will be able to get that. It’s a good 
day. 
tinue the effort towards a universal 
single-payer, not-for-profit health care. 
You know what? Now that we’ve 
proven that reform of health care is 
possible, now that we have proven that 
health care is no longer the third rail 
of American politics, now that we have 
proven that the Court will uphold an 
effort by the Congress to move towards 
health care reform, well, now that 
we’ve proven that, we can say it is pos-
sible to go to a place where we can 
have health care for all under a not- 
for-profit system. 
I thank the gentleman for his leader-
ship, and I look forward to working 
with you as we chart a new course in 
America for health care for all. Thank 
you. 
Mr. ELLISON. Thank you. 
And to the gentleman from Ohio, who 
I know has some things to do, I just 
want to say that when the final chap-
ter is written on the improvement and 
the advance in health care in America, 
there will certainly be chapters on how 
DENNIS KUCINICH, through your leader-
ship as a Member of the House of Rep-
resentatives bill that you introduced 
through your Presidential run, where 
you really made health care a front- 
burner issue, you will have a chapter 
that will designate your great con-
tributions to the American people to 
get 
quality, 
affordable, 
universal 
health care. 
So I do thank you today, sir, because 
I can tell you that today is somewhat 
of a reflection. You should think about 
how your campaign for President and 
other work you have done really did 
move the ball down the track. So I 
thank you, and I honor you for it. 
Mr. KUCINICH. I thank the gen-
tleman. Thank you very much. 
Mr. ELLISON. We’re joined by my 
good friend, JOHN
GARAMENDI
from 
California. 
Congressman GARAMENDI, on a day 
like this, you must be full of thoughts 
about health care reform, the big lift, 
and all of the things that occurred. 
What are some of the thoughts that 
occur to you today, Congressman? 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Thank you, Mr. 
ELLISON. Thank you so very much for 
your consistent and strong voice on 
what we really need to do here in 
America to take care of people. 
At the beginning of the day and at 
the end of the day, our task is to fulfill 
that message of life, liberty, and the 
pursuit of happiness. This day really, 
in many ways, fulfills that. 
Think about it. Can you have life 
without health care? Well, probably 
not for very long. Most everybody I 
know has had a sickness at one point 
or another. If you don’t get health 
care, you may very well lose your life. 
Happiness? We know that most of the 
bankruptcies—this is before the great 
crash—are a direct result of health 
care and not having sufficient insur-
ance or not having insurance. With re-
gard to happiness, wow. 
Of course, liberty. You just think 
about the number of Americans that 
b 1800 
I was the insurance commissioner for 
8 years in California. And if only I had 
this law, if only this law were in place, 
I could have hammered those insurance 
companies that were discriminating 
against people who had preexisting 
conditions. But I didn’t have this law. 
So they were able to get away with dis-
criminating against women because 
they are women. Because they are of 
child-bearing age, they may have a 
child; and it might cost the insurance 
companies money. 
My chief of staff had a child who was 
born with an ailment. That kid, from 
the day of conception to the day after 
he was born, had insurance. As soon as 
the insurance company found out that 
that child had a serious problem, they 
stopped the insurance. The family al-
most went into bankruptcy; but for the 
friends and support around them, they 
would have done so. That is over. 
Every child born in America will con-
tinue to have health care coverage, 
whether they are healthy or not. It’s a 
good day. It’s a good day for the chil-
dren. It’s a good day for the people of 
America. 
Mr. ELLISON. Well, Congressman, I 
share your joy today. And I want to let 
you know that the fact is that there 
are a lot of really important parts of 
this bill, and not enough Americans 
understand what’s in the bill. 
I can remember back a couple of 
years ago when I was trying to have 
community forums in my district, and 
people who didn’t understand the need 
for health care reform would get loud 
and boisterous in these meetings. And I 
would let them talk. I wouldn’t let 
them disrupt the meeting, but I would 
let them talk. And some of them ex-
pressed themselves in very passionate 
ways. 
One of the things they said to me 
was, Did you read the bill? And they 
wouldn’t ask the question. They would 
basically make an accusation that I 
didn’t read the bill. Of course I had 
read the bill. 
And I think it’s now a good idea to 
really help people understand what 
I think that we need to recognize 
that we’ve taken a big step here. As 
someone who wasn’t sure at first, as 
someone who, in a sense, reluctantly 
voted for the Affordable Care Act on 
the hope that by proving we could have 
reform within the context of a for-prof-
it system, that it would open the door 
for further reforms, I’d say this is a 
great day. It shows that it’s possible to 
reform that for-profit system. 
I’m hopeful, as we’re celebrating 
today, that we look down the road to 
what we’re going to do in the future, 
which is to restart our efforts here, re-
start the effort for a single-payer sys-
tem, knowing at least that we have the 
assurance that more people are cov-
ered, that you don’t have to worry 
about your child 26 and under, whether 
they are going to be covered under the 
policy, that you don’t have to worry 
about a child with a preexisting condi-
tion, that you don’t have to worry 
about long-term caps, that you don’t 
have to worry about if you’re a senior 
where that doughnut hole is going to 
cause your budget to get crushed. What 
you have now is the government finally 
taking the side of the people and put-
ting us in a position where we now are 
able, with integrity and with drive, to 
move towards the future where some-
day we’re going to keep working for 
that single-payer system. 
Mr. ELLISON. I don’t know if this 
happened to you today, but it did hap-
pen to me. I started thinking about all 
the door knocking that I did and think-
ing about the health care horror sto-
ries that I heard. 
I just want to ask you today, when 
you reflect on 57 percent of the people 
filing for bankruptcy being motivated 
by medical debt, when you hear about 
people getting a lifetime cap and not 
being able to get any additional health 
care, even when they’ve got cancer or 
if they’ve got cancer, then they get 
dropped. 
Mr. KUCINICH. The gentleman is 
right. The gentleman is correct. When 
you think of how many people—most 
bankruptcies, they’re connected to peo-
ple not being able to pay hospital bills. 
Any single family has known the dread 
of having one individual get ill in the 
family, and everything people worked a 
lifetime for, they lose. 
Mr. ELLISON. The gentleman might 
reflect on the fact that many of these 
people you’re referring to have insur-
ance, and I yield to the gentleman. 
Mr. KUCINICH. Oh, that’s right. 
Think about this now. You can have 
insurance, and if you run up against 
lifetime caps on coverage, you’re out of 
luck. So many Americans have gotten 
in trouble financially because, even 
though they have insurance, they can’t 
pay the bills. The bills have sent Amer-
icans into poverty. 
We need to realize that we’ve taken a 
step in the direction of a substantial 
support for the American people and 
their health care with the Affordable 
Care Act, but it’s not the final step. 
Again, I am here to share with you, 
Mr. Speaker, my willingness to con-

would think they would say, Okay, 
okay. We just wanted to make sure it’s 
constitutional. Now we’re ready to join 
hands with you and celebrate this 
great thing to make sure all Americans 
can go to the doctor. But what do they 
do? They schedule a repeal vote. 
Here’s what I want people to know, 
Congressman: according to the Con-
gressional Budget Office—which is a 
nonpartisan entity—if they repeal this 
bill, it will add to the deficit $230 bil-
lion. These are my friends who never 
tire of saying, Oh, we’re conferring 
debt on our children and grandchildren. 
They always say that. I’m sure it’s 
been tested by, you know, some high- 
paid individual who does that kind of 
stuff. They never tire of saying, Our 
children and grandchildren, we are pil-
ing debt on our children and grand-
children. 
But if they strip the Affordable Care 
Act, as they plan on doing on July 11, 
they would drop a big debt and add to 
the deficit. 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Thank you so very 
much, Mr. ELLISON. And thank you for 
your leadership on this and so many 
other issues. 
I’m looking at that sign next to you: 
‘‘Republicans’ No-Jobs Agenda.’’ A re-
peal of the Affordable Health Care Act 
and the Patients’ Bill of Rights is not 
going to create jobs. In fact, it is going 
to make it very, very difficult for 
small businesses because the Afford-
able Health Care Act actually helps 
small businesses. 
Mr. ELLISON. Right. 
b 1810 
Mr. GARAMENDI. They don’t have 
the mandate. Small businesses don’t 
have the mandate. But what they do 
have is an opportunity. They have an 
opportunity to get health insurance at 
an affordable cost, which they’ve never 
had before. Small business, one-person, 
or husband and wife, perhaps, and two 
or three employees, it literally was im-
possible for them to get affordable 
health insurance for themselves and for 
their three employees. 
Under this bill, they can get it. It’s 
subsidized, to be sure. But they can fi-
nally get insurance. And across the 
State of California and across this Na-
tion we’re finding thousands upon 
thousands of businesses for the first 
time going into the insurance market, 
able to buy insurance, getting coverage 
for themselves and their employees 
while providing what insurance must 
do, which is the knowledge and the sta-
bility that is necessary for the finances 
of that business to succeed. 
The other thing—and I’m just going 
to pick up one more that’s very, very 
close to me—in California, the Afford-
able Care Act provided funding for 1,154 
clinics. Way back in 1978, when I was in 
the California legislature, and in 1976 
as a member of the Assembly, I au-
thored legislation to establish the 
Rural Health Act. And that built clin-
ics in the rural part of California. And 
today, as a result of that, there are 
good things are in this bill. For exam-
ple, I think it’s important for people to 
understand that already in the bill, if 
you have a child under the age of 26, 
that child can be on your health care 
insurance. No more worries that your 
college graduate kid, who has not yet 
got that job, is just out there with no 
insurance. If you are a woman, they 
can’t discriminate against you any-
more. If you have a preexisting condi-
tion and you are a child, even at this 
moment, 
they 
can’t 
discriminate 
against you. And when the bill is fully 
in effect, they won’t be able to dis-
criminate against anyone. 
If you are a senior, we’re helping to 
make the cost of prescription drugs 
more affordable by filling the doughnut 
hole. Also, for Medicare, we have a pro-
vision in there that’s helping to make 
sure that preventative screenings are 
free in order to have healthy, strong 
seniors to prevent them from getting 
sick. There’s a medical loss ratio which 
says that the insurance company has 
to devote 85 percent of their receipts 
into health care, not all this other ad-
ministrative stuff, including exorbi-
tant pay. 
So as we sit back and reflect on what 
is actually in there, I think it’s impor-
tant to make those points. 
Is there anything you would like to 
add? 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Let me just take 
up some of those numbers because 
they’re very, very exciting. 
Thirteen million Americans will re-
ceive $1.1 billion in rebates because the 
insurance companies have overcharged 
them. That didn’t happen before this 
bill. I didn’t have that power, as insur-
ance commissioner, to do that; 54 mil-
lion Americans that are in private 
health insurance plans will receive free 
preventative services as a result of this 
legislation. 
Mr. ELLISON. Fifty-four million— 
wow. 
Mr. GARAMENDI. And, of course, 
women—millions across this Nation— 
will receive free coverage for com-
prehensive 
women’s 
preventative 
health services: Pap smears, breast x 
rays and the like. In 2011, 32.5 million 
seniors received one or more preventa-
tive services. In 2012, 14 million seniors 
have already received these services. 
105 million Americans will no longer 
have a lifetime limit on their coverage. 
Before this bill was in effect, if you go 
up to $100,000 or $200,000—if you had a 
serious illness, you could go through 
that, bam—that’s it. You don’t get any 
more coverage. No longer. No more 
limits. Lifetime limits are gone. 
Seventeen million children with pre-
existing conditions can no longer be de-
nied coverage by insurance companies; 
6.6 million young adults—what you 
were just talking about—you are talk-
ing about my daughter. She graduated 
at the age of 21, 22; lost her insurance. 
The day after this bill passed, she said, 
Dad, can I get back on your policy? 
The answer was yes. Actually, it took 6 
months, but it did happen. 5.3 million 
seniors in the doughnut hole—this is 
the drug coverage portion—have saved 
$3.7 billion on prescription drugs al-
ready. 
Now, our good friends, the Repub-
licans, want to repeal all of this. So 
you go through this list: 13 million 
Americans will not receive a rebate if 
the Republicans succeed in repealing 
the bill; 54 million Americans will not 
receive preventative services; 6.6 mil-
lion young Americans will not be on 
their parents’ coverage between the 
age of 21 and 26. There are a lot of 
takeaways from what the Republicans 
want to do with their repeal. 
Mr. ELLISON. If the gentleman 
would yield, I think that is a very im-
portant point to make. Sadly, as soon 
as the Affordable Care Act was upheld, 
our friends in the Republican Caucus 
immediately said, Well, we’re going to 
have a repeal vote. Well, they’ve al-
ready had a repeal vote. What are we 
doing this over and over and over again 
for? Well, we’re doing it for a very im-
portant reason: to make a political 
point. 
As they were announcing another re-
peal 
vote—another 
repeal 
vote—we 
haven’t done anything about student 
loans this week, which are expiring. We 
haven’t done anything about jobs. And 
we haven’t done anything about the 
transit bill, which is due to expire. I 
mean, it’s just really amazing how 
much time we have for stuff that 
doesn’t matter, just political games-
manship. 
But, you know, I must share this 
with you, Congressman. I’m saddened 
by the fact that our Republican friends 
won’t join with us in this awesome 
good thing that happened to the Amer-
ican people today. I wish they would fi-
nally come around. It’s like, look, you 
know, you fought the health care— 
Well, first of all, between 2000 and 
2006, you had the White House, the Sen-
ate, and the House of Representatives. 
You didn’t do anything except give a 
bunch of money to Big Pharma. And 
we’re trying to fix that right now. 
But all this stuff they talk about. Oh, 
we want to sell insurance across State 
lines. We want to do tort reform. They 
could have done all of that. They didn’t 
do it because they didn’t want to do it. 
Now they say that’s what they would 
have done, but that’s not what they did 
do when they could have done it. So 
there you go with that. 
So now we, the Democrats, went and 
took up health care. After many, many 
years of trying, we get it through. 
They fight it tooth and nail. To their 
credit, none of them supported the 
final vote on the Affordable Care Act. 
They 
were 
solid 
and 
unanimously 
against conferring the benefits that are 
contained in the Affordable Care Act. 
Well, now they got around to saying 
the bill was unconstitutional. It’s un-
constitutional. And you heard this hue 
and cry day and night. And they even 
called themselves ‘‘constitutional con-
servatives.’’ 
Well, the constitutional Court has 
said, This bill is constitutional. So you

the Phoenix office and the Washington, 
D.C., office. It didn’t happen. 
So in terms of an investigation, you 
have a partial investigation focusing 
on the end of the story rather than on 
the full story. And today, the first time 
ever in the history of this Nation, this 
body voted to hold in contempt a Cabi-
net official on a half-baked, insuffi-
cient investigation that purposefully 
ignored calling witnesses that were ac-
tually engaged in the Fast and Furious 
operation and who were responsible in 
the Phoenix office for that operation. 
b 1820 
It was a farce. It was a political 
event, and we walked out. Not a good 
day. 
And as you said a moment ago, there 
are things we must do. Men and women 
and families across this country are 
hurting. They’re unemployed. They 
want jobs. They want to go to work. 
Transportation, where’s the transpor-
tation bill? We never did get one out of 
this House that was meaningful. We 
just passed a little thing so we can get 
to conference. It had nothing in it, but 
it allowed us to go to conference. 
Where’s that bill? How about student 
interest rates, where’s that bill? And 
what about the jobs program? 
What if the September 2011 proposal 
that President Obama put forward, the 
American Jobs Act, what if we had 
taken that up? Three million, 4 million 
Americans would be working today. 
What if we had done that? But it didn’t 
happen. Our colleagues on the Repub-
lican side refused to bring it up in this 
House and refused to allow it to be 
brought up in the Senate. That’s sad. 
That’s a very sad thing for America. It 
is one of the great ‘‘we should haves,’’ 
but we were prevented from doing so. 
Mr. ELLISON. Well, Congressman, I 
have some obligations that require me 
to curtail our hour a little early. You 
can carry on if you like. 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Well, I, too, must 
go. But I thank you very much for al-
lowing me to talk about three very im-
portant things. I appreciate that, Mr. 
ELLISON. 
Mr. ELLISON. You are famous for 
nailing the need for a greater invest-
ment in manufacturing and supporting 
American jobs, and I thank you for all 
of the great work you’re doing. 
Mr. GARAMENDI. You must mean 
Make It in America. Spend our tax 
money on American-made equipment 
and jobs, not on Chinese or Japanese or 
anybody else, but on American jobs. 
We can do that. 
Mr. ELLISON. We can do it. 
Let me wrap up by saying it has been 
a great evening, a great day for the 
American people. The Affordable Care 
Act has been vindicated in the Su-
preme Court. Unfortunately, the day is 
somewhat marred by the unfortunate 
behavior of the majority in trying to 
go after Eric Holder. Nonetheless, it’s 
another day in Washington. 
The Progressive Caucus will be back 
next week. Thank you very much. 
tion, 
when 
that 
information 
was 
sought, the administration, the White 
House said, No, we’re going to exercise 
executive privilege. Obviously, if the 
President exercises executive privilege, 
the Attorney General has to abide by 
that decision. 
And despite all those facts, today on 
the House floor the Republican major-
ity, instead of dealing with jobs, in-
stead of dealing with health care, in-
stead of dealing with renewing the stu-
dent loan interest rates, which are 
about to double; instead of dealing 
with the transportation bill, which is 
about to expire, we go do a witch hunt 
on Eric Holder. It’s really too bad. 
Any thoughts on this issue you care 
to share? 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Well, I do. And 
like most of my Democratic col-
leagues, we just walked out of this 
Chamber and said this is not worthy of 
the dignity of the House of Representa-
tives. And we weren’t going to honor 
this process with our presence. 
Let’s go back here. The Fast and Fu-
rious programs actually began in the 
George 
W. 
Bush 
administration, 
I 
think, around 2005, 2006. And there were 
two iterations of it, two different 
projects that were underway out of the 
Phoenix office of the ATF. And they 
were trying to find out who the gun-
runners were. We’ve all watched the 
Western movies and the gunrunners. 
Well, there are American gunrunners 
that were running guns to the narco 
folks in Mexico. We wanted to find out 
what is going on here, where are these 
guns coming from. And that was, once 
again, during the George W. Bush ad-
ministration and had gone on for 2, 3 
years. 
The Obama administration comes in. 
Eric Holder is chosen as Attorney Gen-
eral. And the program continued. The 
tragedy occurred. An agent was killed. 
And from there, Fast and Furious—this 
is now what we call the walking of the 
guns—became known. Eric Holder shut 
it down. In that process, a letter was 
written to the Senate committee say-
ing that it didn’t exist. Clearly, an 
error, I am told. But this House doesn’t 
know today. Never investigated by the 
committee. But I am told that there 
was information that the office in 
Phoenix, Arizona, misled the office in 
Washington, D.C., and a letter was sent 
forth that was incorrect. That should 
be the subject of the investigation: 
What happened here; what actually 
went on in Arizona. 
Not one witness from the actual op-
eration was called to testify. Not one. 
So this is really a very strange and 
botched investigation. If you want to 
get to the bottom of it, you’ve got to 
talk to the people that actually did it. 
It didn’t happen. The Democrats on the 
committee demanded several times: 
Bring forth the people who did the Fast 
and Furious from the Bush administra-
tion into the Obama administration. 
Bring them forward. Get their testi-
mony. Find out what happened. Find 
out about the communications between 
clinics all across the State of Cali-
fornia, and the Affordable Care Act 
keeps those clinics in business. 
This is where many Californians and 
across this Nation Americans access 
the health care system. It’s there in 
their community. These are the com-
munity clinics that are so critically 
important in providing the health care 
that Americans need. The call for re-
peal kills these clinics. These clinics 
will die if this bill is repealed. 
So out across the State, even in the 
most conservative part of my new dis-
trict, Colusa County, there are clinics 
that are dependent upon this legisla-
tion and will be able to continue as a 
result of the Affordable Care Act, found 
by the Supreme Court, including Chief 
Justice Roberts, to be constitutional. 
This is constitutional. The legislature, 
Congress, and the Senate and the 
President have the power to solve one 
of the great America dilemmas: The 
health care system. 
Over time, we’ll change this. We’ll 
make 
modifications. 
Among 
those 
modifications ought to be an expansion 
of Medicare, which is efficient, effec-
tive, and universally available to every 
American over the age of 65. How good 
it is. How hard and how determined 
people are—if I can just live to 65, I’ll 
have Medicare. It’s a great program. 
We ought to expand it. We ought to 
make it universal. 
Mr. ELLISON, I don’t know how much 
time you have. 
Mr. ELLISON. We’ve got about 30 
minutes or so. 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Well, there are 
things we can talk about. 
Mr. ELLISON. I would actually like 
to take up what happened with Eric 
Holder today. 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Let’s talk about 
that. 
Mr. ELLISON. The Holder case, Eric 
Holder, when he came in office, this 
program, the Fast and Furious, was on-
going. It was a gunwalking program. 
The original theory was that if you put 
some guns into the stream of com-
merce, then you can find out who’s 
buying them, who’s selling them, and 
try to get to the bottom of some of 
these cartels that trade in illegal guns, 
straw purchasers and so forth. Well, it 
was a poorly conceived plan, and trag-
edy occurred. A border enforcement of-
ficer, Officer Terry, was killed as a re-
sult with one of these guns. We all 
pause in his honor and offer our sincere 
condolences to his family. 
When Attorney General Holder found 
out about this program, he shut the 
program down. But then, of course, as 
facts came to light, it is a legitimate 
source of investigation. And he sub-
mitted to nine hearings, 8,000 pages of 
documentation. But when it finally got 
down to it, when there was information 
that was of a deliberative nature—not 
on the facts of what happened to Offi-
cer Terry, but just exchange of infor-
mation—and pending criminal informa-
tion, which everyone in this room 
should know is not for public consump-

APPOINTMENT 
AS 
MEMBER 
TO 
UNITED 
STATES-CHINA 
ECO-
NOMIC AND SECURITY REVIEW 
COMMISSION 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair announces the Speaker’s ap-
pointment, 
pursuant 
to 
section 
1238(b)(3) of the Floyd D. Spence Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act for 
Fiscal Year 2001 (22 U.S.C. 7002), as 
amended, and the order of the House of 
January 5, 2011, of the following mem-
ber on the part of the House to the 
United States-China Economic and Se-
curity Review Commission for a term 
to expire December 31, 2014: 
Mr. Peter Brookes, Springfield, Vir-
ginia 
f 
the monetary penalty for failure to pay 
is in fact a tax or not. But even if we 
accept the penalty as a tax, as the 
Court has rewritten the law to be, such 
a tax is still unconstitutional for many 
reasons. 
First, the Constitution lays out three 
types of permissible taxes. This tax is 
not accessed on income, so it is uncon-
stitutional in that regard. This tax is 
not assessed uniformly and is triggered 
by economic inactivity so it is uncon-
stitutional in that regard. And the tax 
is not apportioned among the States by 
population, so it is unconstitutional in 
that regard. 
Even more importantly, the Con-
stitution does not grant Congress an 
independent power to tax for any pur-
pose that it wants. Taxing to provide 
for the general welfare does not mean 
there is limitless power of Congress to 
tax. Rather, it means that a tax must 
be for a national purpose to achieve the 
ends that are outlined within the enu-
merated powers. 
Now, this is not only my view; this 
was the view of James Madison, who 
ought to know a little bit about the 
Constitution since he is the man most 
responsible for it. 
There is nothing about the individual 
mandate defined as a tax that is sanc-
tioned by the Constitution. 
But we have strayed far from the 
Constitution 
of 
the 
Founders. 
No 
longer is the ability to tax constrained 
by the limits imposed by that great 
document. The growth and power of 
this government would render it not 
only unrecognizable, but also repulsive 
to the Founders. 
Madison and his fellow revolution-
aries worried about the growth of gov-
ernment and the yielding of liberty. 
The writings they left for posterity are 
full of warnings about the fragility of 
limited government. Madison believed 
Republican governments would perpet-
ually be on the defensive against the 
encroachments 
of 
aspiring 
tyrants. 
John Adams agreed when he said, ‘‘De-
mocracy never lasts long.’’ 
And perhaps the most famous quote 
of all was Ben Franklin at the Con-
stitutional Convention when he said we 
have produced ‘‘a republic, if you can 
keep it.’’ 
And now, 225 years later, we have ar-
rived at this moment. 
We should strive to restore the free 
society of our Founding Fathers that 
they fought for. If liberty is our goal, 
the Supreme Court has failed the 
American people. And so although we 
come 
here 
tonight 
extremely 
dis-
appointed that the Supreme Court did 
not rise to the defense of the Constitu-
tion, I can take solace with the knowl-
edge that the people of this country 
will. 
SUPREME COURT HEALTH CARE 
DECISION 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 5, 2011, the gentleman from Geor-
gia (Mr. GRAVES) is recognized for 60 
minutes as the designee of the major-
ity leader. 
Mr. GRAVES of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today with a group of col-
leagues of mine to speak in contrast to 
what we just heard. It is shocking to 
me, not only the news of today and the 
continuation of the overreach of the 
Federal Government, but to hear col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle 
who are advocating for the Progressive 
Caucus, the progressive movement in 
this Nation celebrating, truly cele-
brating the Supreme Court ruling of 
today which allows the Federal Gov-
ernment to continue reaching into the 
homes of American families all across 
this country in a way that has never 
been done before, and granted so much 
more taxing power that has never been 
granted before, and yet they celebrate. 
And they used a lot of different 
terms, like ‘‘charting the new course.’’ 
That was a phrase that was used by the 
Progressive Caucus here just a moment 
ago—charting the new course. One has 
to wonder: What is this new course? It 
has been a course that the progressive 
movement has been on now for nearly 
a century; and today they are cele-
brating that course continuing to be 
charted, and that is a course of more 
government and less liberty. And that 
is what this decision was all about 
today. It was about empowering gov-
ernment 
and 
not 
empowering 
the 
American people. It is about creating 
more government and less liberty. 
That’s what the decision reflected 
today. 
I am joined today by many good 
friends here in the House of Represent-
atives who are on the side of liberty. 
They’re on the side of the American 
taxpayers, and they’re on the side of 
the private sector. They believe in free 
markets and capitalism and profits and 
success and dreaming, and they don’t 
think that the Federal Government has 
to get in the way of any of that. 
b 1830 
See, the Americans of this country 
revere the Constitution, and they will 
not let it be trampled upon. They long 
cherish their liberties. They will not 
surrender them without a fight. 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to first 
yield to the gentleman from New Jer-
sey (Mr. GARRETT) to get his insights 
on today’s decisions. 
Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Mr. GRAVES for leading the floor to-
night on this very important matter. 
He joins me, I’m sure, in saying that 
we’re all extremely disappointed that 
we have to come to the floor tonight 
and that the Supreme Court ruled 
today that the Commerce Clause does 
not support the individual mandate, 
but it may be upheld within Congress’s 
power to lay and collect taxes. 
So what we have found today is that 
Congress cannot use the Commerce 
Clause to compel you to do something. 
But, instead, Congress can tax you into 
submission. It should have been crystal 
clear that the Commerce Clause, which 
grants power to Congress to enforce 
free trade pacts amongst the States, 
could not use that clause to regulate 
it. 
If Congress can force you to purchase 
a product, then there is nothing gov-
ernment cannot force you to do. This 
would have been a violation of your in-
dividual liberties as well as the con-
stitutional 
doctrine 
of 
enumerated 
powers in which Congress is only given 
few and specific powers. 
As the Supreme Court’s syllabus of 
this case states: 
The Framers knew the difference between 
doing something and doing nothing. They 
gave Congress the power to regulate com-
merce, not to compel it. Ignoring that dis-
tinction would undermine the principle that 
the Federal Government is a government of 
limited and enumerated powers. 
But the Supreme Court instead told 
us that Congress has the power to tax 
and tax and tax until you submit to it. 
Is this at all consistent with the 
founding principles of this country? 
Did those brave patriots who fought in 
the Revolutionary War and faced es-
trangement from their families, who 
endured British cannon fire and mus-
ket fire, weathered freezing winters 
and blazing summers, marched without 
shoes, slept without blankets, and suf-
fered perpetual starvation all so that 
Congress could tax the people to form 
their behavior in Congress’s image? 
Did the Founders, who objected to 
the Stamp Act, the Sugar Act, and the 
Declaratory Act, which led our great 
Nation to revolt, risk the charge of 
treason and put their lives, fortunes, 
and sacred honor at risk, all so that 
they could replace one King who de-
manded more taxation, and now re-
place it with a President who demands 
more taxation? No. 
We are Americans, citizens of a con-
stitutional Republic where individual 
liberty is our birthright, won by our 
Founding generation’s sacrifices. We 
are not and shall never be mere sub-
jects of a government that can tax its 
way to tyranny. And disturbing as it is, 
there are many problems with this ma-
jority Court’s rationale. 
You see, the Obama administration 
has been confused as to whether or not

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4427 
June 28, 2012 
So he goes on to conclude that since 
Congress says in ObamaCare, the Af-
fordable Care Act—boy, is that a mis-
nomer, the Affordable Care Act—since 
Congress calls it a penalty, then Jus-
tice Roberts and the majority say it’s 
not a tax; it is a penalty. 
So around page 15 or so, 15, 16, they 
come around and say—I guess, 15, okay: 
Congress made clear that the penalty 
is what it is—not a tax. Therefore, the 
Anti-Injunction Act does not apply, so 
our Court has jurisdiction. As he says, 
the 
Anti-Injunction 
Act, 
therefore, 
does not apply to this suit since it’s a 
penalty and not a tax. Therefore, as he 
says, we may proceed to the merits. 
Okay. So he clears it’s a penalty; it’s 
not a tax. Because if it’s a tax, they 
can’t do anything; they’ve got to throw 
it out. Okay. So it’s a penalty, not a 
tax. 
So then he goes on, after page 16, he 
goes on in the majority opinion to dis-
cuss this issue of whether or not it vio-
lates the Commerce Clause, this pen-
alty. He comes to the proper conclu-
sion that if Congress can mandate a 
penalty for not buying a product, 
there’s nothing to stop Congress from 
intruding in every area of individual 
Americans’ lives. 
It’s mentioned in this opinion that 
the main purpose—one of the two main 
purposes is to bring down the cost of 
health care. The Supreme Court thinks 
that’s a legitimate reason to pass an 
act, bring down the cost of health care. 
But Justice Roberts and the majority 
decide it would violate the Commerce 
Clause, because if you can force indi-
vidual Americans to buy a particular 
product in order to bring down the cost 
of health care, you can order anything. 
You and I can be ordered to join a gym 
and to start exercising X number of 
hours a week. 
We’re told that the Federal Govern-
ment does not monitor debit card and 
credit card purchases—although, sup-
posedly it could. Well, if it has a duty 
to bring down health care costs and it 
has the ability to watch your pur-
chases, and, under ObamaCare, the 
Federal Government, through their re-
lationship 
with 
General 
Electric— 
sweetheart deal they did with GE— 
they’re going to hold everybody’s med-
ical records. So if they’re holding 
everybody’s medical records, then I 
don’t know why they wouldn’t go 
ahead and monitor everybody’s choles-
terol rate, blood pressure, things like 
that. 
b 1840 
And so it could conceivably get to 
the point where, gee, you get a letter 
from the government that says, we no-
tice your cholesterol rate’s up to 250 or 
so and we notice you bought bacon this 
weekend. What were you thinking? You 
know, you’ve got to take that back. 
You can’t keep bacon. 
Anyway, there’s no limit to what 
Congress can do to intrude in people’s 
lives. And I’d point out to my friend 
from Georgia, liberals are constantly 
Since the enactment of ObamaCare, I 
have seen the tireless efforts of patri-
ots, both in my district, in the State, 
and across the country, trying to re-
peal ObamaCare. I am inspired by their 
passion, by their determination to de-
fend the Constitution. This generation 
of Americans will not allow history to 
say that we presided over the demise of 
the American experiment in limited 
government. 
Now, it is true that the struggle 
against ObamaCare has been long and 
difficult and sometimes met, as today, 
with disappointing results. But for 
those of us who still believe in our 
founding principles, I offer some advice 
from Thomas Jefferson, who said, ‘‘The 
ground of liberty is to be gained by 
inches.’’ 
So we stand here tonight all to-
gether, pledging to work alongside the 
people of this great Nation who will 
fight inch by inch in defense of the 
Constitution, 
and 
we 
will 
repeal 
ObamaCare. Mr. Speaker, ObamaCare 
must be repealed entirely, because if it 
is not, the constitutional Republic and 
the safeguards of our natural rights 
through limited government will be 
lost. 
Mr. GRAVES of Georgia. I thank the 
gentleman from New Jersey for your 
inspirational remarks reflecting back 
on the history of this country and the 
great leaders and the Founders and the 
principles which this Nation was based 
upon. While the erosion continues—and 
we’ve seen more of it even today with 
the ruling—the resolve is even strong-
er. 
So to those that may be listening or 
watching, you can know that there is a 
group of Members in the House of Rep-
resentatives that are not going to let 
up, that are going to be fully resolved 
to repealing ObamaCare in its entirety, 
pulling it out, each and every root of 
this legislation, and empowering the 
people and not empowering govern-
ment. Because, why? Because this is 
not a government of the Court, by the 
Court, or for the Court. This is a gov-
ernment of the people, by the people, 
and for the people, and I am convinced 
that the people will have their voice 
heard in the next few months. 
So as we heard from the progressives 
earlier in their continued march down 
this new chartered course of more gov-
ernment and less liberty, we are thank-
fully joined tonight by a great friend of 
liberty and a great advocate of liberty, 
and that is Louis Gohmert from Texas. 
I’d like to yield to the gentleman 
from Texas. 
Mr. GOHMERT. I sure do appreciate 
my friend from Georgia. He is an abso-
lute patriot, standing for truth, jus-
tice, and what used to be the American 
way. It is, according to the Supreme 
Court, not so much anymore. And I ap-
preciate the gentleman for yielding. 
I’ve been going through this decision, 
and having been an attorney—and I’ve 
been a prosecutor and a judge and a 
chief justice. It was a small, three- 
judge court, but you learn things—you 
go to judicial conferences—about how 
to write opinions and things, never to 
the level of the United States Supreme 
Court. But as a certified member of the 
United States Supreme Court Bar, you 
follow the holdings of the courts. 
So it’s been with great interest, after 
I got my wind back from having found 
that Chief Justice Roberts wrote the 
opinion for the five-person majority, 
okay, so we start going through the 
opinion. Let’s see how in the world he 
came to this conclusion. 
Well, I’ll be very brief in jumping 
through, even though it’s a very long 
opinion, including the dissents. But the 
first thing that the Court had to con-
sider is the Anti-Injunction Act that 
was passed by Congress years ago that 
makes very clear that the Supreme 
Court cannot take up any issue regard-
ing a tax unless the tax has actually 
been levied and someone required to 
pay the tax, and then someone against 
whom the tax has been levied—required 
to pay that tax—files suit, that person 
then 
has 
standing. 
Well, 
under 
ObamaCare, if the mandate is a tax, 
the penalty is a tax, then the Anti-In-
junction Act would kick in and no one 
would be allowed to have standing be-
fore the Federal district court, court of 
appeals, and certainly not the U.S. Su-
preme Court. 
So the first thing the Supreme Court 
had to get past was the issue of: Is this 
penalty a tax? Because if it’s a tax, 
then the Supreme Court must throw 
this case out, announce that the plain-
tiffs in these cases have no standing— 
and will not until around 2014—until 
such time as the tax is levied. 
So the Court goes through, and if 
anybody prints out the decision, you 
can look at pages 11 through 15 specifi-
cally where they discuss the Anti-In-
junction Act. They point out just, in 
essence, what I have hopefully clari-
fied: If it’s a penalty, then the Court 
can take it up. If the penalty that you 
must pay for not buying the insurance 
is a tax, then this case goes out, no Su-
preme Court decision for at least 2 to 4 
years. 
So Chief Justice Roberts—brilliant 
man, there’s no question he’s a very 
brilliant intellectual—he indicates this 
and says: 
Congress’s decision to label this exac-
tion a penalty rather than a tax is sig-
nificant because the Affordable Care 
Act describes many other exactions it 
creates that are taxes. 
And he says this: 
Where Congress uses certain lan-
guage in one part of a statute and dif-
ferent language in another, it is gen-
erally presumed that Congress acts in-
tentionally. 
So he goes on and he says: 
The Anti-Injunction Act and the Af-
fordable Care Act are creatures of Con-
gress’ own creation. How they relate to 
each other is up to Congress, and the 
best evidence—the Supreme Court’s 
words, Justice Roberts’ words—the best 
evidence of Congress’ intent is the stat-
utory language, the statutory text.

June 28, 2012 
It doesn’t make sense that a man 
that smart would have a product this 
poor, using first person, criticizing an-
other justice in the majority with him, 
then saying what he would do. Well, he 
is doing, he’s writing the majority 
opinion. He has no business saying 
that. 
And then he goes through, it says the 
States also can end Medicaid, expan-
sion 
exceeds 
authority 
under 
the 
spending 
clause. 
But 
basically 
he 
comes back and upholds it, and then 
strikes down that you can’t force the 
States to do these things. 
But, I remind my friends, the Presi-
dent says it’s absolutely not a tax. The 
only way this bill gets upheld is if the 
Supreme Court finds it is a tax after 
they find jurisdiction by saying it’s not 
a tax. 
But this is the same President who 
said, if you like your health insurance, 
you’re going to keep it. He said, if you 
like your doctor, you can keep your 
doctor. We found those were lies. 
He said, it’s going to bring down the 
cost of health care. In every indication 
we’ve seen, insurance has dramatically 
gone up. And I get tired of hearing peo-
ple say, because their memories are 
poor in here across the aisle, well, look 
at the good things in here. Twenty-six 
year olds can be on their own parents’ 
insurance. Gee, you can buy insurance 
across State lines because of us. We’ve 
taken care of the unfairness that some 
insurance used with preexisting condi-
tions as an exclusion. 
But I would encourage my friends, I 
know my colleagues here remember, 
back when they had the House, they 
had the Senate majority, they had the 
White House, Republicans, many of us 
begged them, let us do some bipartisan 
bills together because we can agree. 
It’s not a problem to let 26-year olds 
stay on your parents’ insurance. Heck, 
the insurance companies love that be-
cause they are usually healthy. It’s not 
a big cost. So we were going to be able 
to agree on that. 
It was a Republican, heck, John 
Shadegg is the first one I ever heard 
saying you’ve got to sell insurance 
across State lines. That was a Repub-
lican idea, so of course most of us sup-
ported that. 
b 1850 
As for the preexisting conditions, 
most of us are aware of circumstances 
in which insurance companies have 
been grossly unfair in using that exclu-
sion. We were prepared to reach some 
agreements and have bipartisan, stand-
alone bills. I know that my friend Dr. 
PRICE out here had some concern about 
health care, his having devoted his life 
to it before government, trying to fix 
what government had done to health 
care. People have been concerned about 
it. We were willing to agree on these 
things, but they would not have it. 
So to say without ObamaCare we 
don’t have these other things is simply 
not true, and it forgets current history. 
We were ready to agree on standalone 
After finding that it’s not a tax, it’s 
a penalty, then Chief Justice Roberts 
comes over to page 39 and he says, the 
joint dissenters argue that we cannot 
uphold section 5000(a) as a tax because 
Congress did not ‘‘frame it’’ as such. 
And then he goes on and he says, la-
bels should not control here. 
What? He just said before, Congress’ 
own expressed written intent is the 
best evidence of what their intent is. 
And yet, now he comes over here, page 
39 and says, wait, wait, wait. We have 
to look at what the intent is, but labels 
should not control. 
So then he goes through and makes 
this ridiculous argument that it is a 
tax. And he says over here, page 44, the 
Affordable Care Act’s requirement that 
certain individuals pay a financial pen-
alty for not obtaining health insurance 
may be reasonably considered as a tax 
because the Constitution permits such 
tax. It’s not our role to forbid it or to 
pass upon its wisdom or fairness. 
But then, one of the big mysteries in 
this brilliant man’s opinion for the ma-
jority uses the first person pronoun, I. 
Now, you know, anybody that’s been a 
judge, normally you go to judicial con-
ferences, you have seminars, you have 
training in writing style. If it’s an indi-
vidual judge, sole court opinion, then 
you’ll write it one way. If it’s a mul-
tiple justice opinion you write it an-
other way. 
You see first person pronoun I in dis-
sents, even though it’s really not the 
best grammar to use pronouns in dis-
sents. But you don’t see them in well- 
written majority opinions. And Chief 
Justice Roberts is one of the best lin-
guists we’ve had on the Court. 
And he takes Justice Ginsberg to 
task a few different places in the ma-
jority opinion, and yet, she is one of 
his voting justices to support the ma-
jority. That doesn’t make sense. 
You don’t normally see one justice 
writing the majority opinion take off 
and criticize someone who’s voting 
with him. That doesn’t make sense. 
But here at page 44 he says, Justice 
Ginsberg questions the necessity of re-
jecting the government’s commerce 
power argument, given that section 
5000(a) can be upheld under the taxing 
power. 
He says, Chief Justice Roberts, ma-
jority opinion, but the statute reads 
more naturally as a command to buy 
insurance than as a tax. So now he’s 
back to what he originally said before 
he says it is a tax. 
And then he says this: And I, Chief 
Justice Roberts, would uphold it, talk-
ing basically of future perfect tense. I 
would uphold it as a command if the 
Constitution allowed it. I would uphold 
it. 
He’s writing for the majority. There’s 
no reason for him to have the first per-
son pronoun ‘‘I’’ there. It doesn’t make 
sense. I don’t know. Maybe this part he 
was writing as a dissent, and all of a 
sudden found himself in the majority, 
and amazingly, nobody caught this 
problem of style in writing the opinion. 
on the protection of bedroom privacy 
rights. I really thought that once they 
fully examined the potential effect of 
ObamaCare, they would be standing 
down here with you and me and my 
other friends hear, Louisiana, Georgia, 
they’d be out here saying, wait a 
minute. If the government has the 
right to order us to do or not do acts or 
buy or not buy products for the sole 
purpose of bringing down the costs of 
health care, there are studies that say 
some certain relational activities cre-
ate more risk for health care problems 
than others, so if this is true, the Fed-
eral Government would have the right 
not only to invade the kitchen and the 
bathroom, but head straight to the 
bedroom and dictate people’s rights. 
I didn’t want to go there, and I felt 
like once we found out that Chief Jus-
tice Roberts makes clear, this is a pen-
alty, not a tax, it violates the Com-
merce Clause to force people to buy a 
product like this, you would think that 
would be the end of it. 
But then Chief Justice Roberts goes 
on, and it doesn’t make sense because 
then he begins to say, well, it violates 
the Commerce Clause, but does it vio-
late the Tax-and-Spend Clause? 
And then he goes through and makes 
a case for saying, it’s not a penalty, 
it’s a tax. And he’s already told us that 
the best way to tell what it is is to 
look what Congress called it. And I 
think, in this case, not only look what 
Congress called it, look at what the 
President called it. 
I just happen to have a partial ex-
cerpt or an excerpt from the transcript 
of a show the President did with his 
friend, George Stephanopolous. And 
Stephanopolous is asking him about it 
and said, you know, under this man-
date, the government’s forcing people 
to spend money, fining you if you 
don’t. How is that not a tax? 
Well, President Obama goes on and 
he lays out all this weak gibberish, and 
eventually gets—Stephanopolous inter-
rupts him and says, okay, that may be, 
but it’s still a tax increase. And the 
President said, that’s not true, George. 
For us to say that you’ve got to take 
responsibility to get health insurance 
is absolutely not a tax increase. 
The President also says, nobody con-
siders that a tax increase. 
He’s not done making clear the will 
of the Congress and of the President, 
who pushed this bill to make it his 
shining bill that he had passed through 
Congress. Stephanopolous goes on and 
says, I want to check for myself, but 
your critics say it’s a tax increase. 
President Obama says, my critics say 
everything is a tax increase. 
Stephanopolous: But you reject that 
it’s a tax increase. 
President Obama says, I absolutely 
reject that notion. Not a tax increase. 
So you would think that if Chief Jus-
tice Roberts and the majority, the 
other four, are going to uphold the 
President’s prize bill, he might accept 
what the President said he’s done in 
this bill. But oh, no.

bills. They didn’t want a bipartisan 
agreement. They wanted the whole 
brass ring and to shove it around our 
heads, around our necks, and eventu-
ally down our throats, and that is what 
has happened. I’ve been amazed at how 
many people have picked up laws and 
started reading them, and I would en-
courage them to read this opinion. It’s 
a very, very strange opinion. It con-
tradicts itself on so many levels. 
ObamaCare 
takes 
away 
religious 
freedom. 
I’m 
Baptist. 
I 
see 
what 
they’re doing to the Catholics, and I 
don’t want to someday say, ‘‘I saw 
what they did to the Catholics, and I 
remained silent,’’ and eventually there 
was nobody to object when they did it 
to me. We all have to stand together, 
and I’m grateful to stand with my 
friends. 
One other comment. I heard my Dem-
ocrat friends before we spoke say, with-
out this ObamaCare bill, these clinics 
will die. 
There have been clinics before the 
ObamaCare bill that helped. We have 
some in my district, and they’re doing 
wonderful work. They need more help. 
The best are, really, charitable institu-
tions. The clinics are not going to die. 
What came from the President’s 
mouth and was also in his town hall 
was when a woman in the White House, 
as part of the town hall, said, Mr. 
President, at an advanced age, my 
mother got a pacemaker. If the doctor 
had not met her, the cardiologist was 
not going to let her have a pacemaker. 
After he met her, he said, absolutely, 
and she has lived years beyond that 
since she has had a pacemaker. So 
would you consider someone’s quality 
of life under your panels—we know 
they don’t want to call them ‘‘death 
panels,’’ but whatever you want to call 
them—will they be able to consider the 
quality of life that people have before 
they agree or disagree to let them have 
a procedure? 
The President beat around the bush 
as he did with Stephanopoulos—and 
you can find the transcript. It’s avail-
able on the Net—and ultimately said, 
You know, maybe we’re just better off 
telling your mother to take a pain pill. 
You don’t get a pacemaker. You don’t 
get these additional years of life. You 
get a pain pill. 
So, when our friends across the aisle 
tonight say that the clinics will die, I 
would humbly submit that, based on 
the President’s own words, it’s not the 
clinics that will die under this bill. 
I thank you so much for your gen-
erous yielding of so much time. It’s a 
bad opinion, and I appreciate having 
the time to walk through some of it. 
Mr. GRAVES of Georgia. I thank the 
gentleman from Texas for walking us 
through the opinion. 
I hope all those who are viewing this 
understand that this is about a tax 
now. This is a new taxing authority, in 
essence, a broadening of the taxing au-
thority. As Mr. GOHMERT brought up, 
this is unheard of. We will now have a 
Federal Government that can do what-
ever it wants to do through taxation. 
In just thinking about the difference 
between ‘‘tax’’ and ‘‘penalty,’’ I guess 
one way to find out is, who do you send 
the check to, right? I mean, where is 
the bill coming from? I imagine it’s 
going to be from the Internal Revenue 
Service. I remember being on the Ap-
propriations Committee and having the 
IRS before us. It was wanting hundreds 
of millions of more dollars to hire more 
people 
for 
the 
implementation 
of 
ObamaCare, and now we all know why, 
and we know what that agency or that 
department collects. 
So here is the crux of the decision 
today: 
While the Court might have said, 
well, the Federal Government can’t tell 
you what to do, they can sure as heck 
punish you through taxes if you don’t 
do what they want you to do, which is 
to be followed up here by my friend 
from Kansas (Mr. HUELSKAMP) who has 
got some great insight. 
Thank you for joining us. 
Mr. HUELSKAMP. Thank you, Con-
gressman GRAVES. I appreciate your 
leadership. Sometimes we wish there 
had been someone like you on the 
Court today. 
Actually, before we forget, as for one 
of 
the 
five 
votes 
that 
upheld 
ObamaCare, in any other court of law, 
that Justice would have recused her-
self. The decision might have only been 
4–4. Justice Kagan should not have 
been in on this decision. In any other 
court, she would have been recused. If 
a lawyer had refused to recuse himself 
as a judge, he would have been vio-
lating ethical rules. Every attorney in 
this country knows that, including the 
Chief Justice, and they said nothing. 
Do you know what? I’m not here to 
talk 
specifically 
about 
that. 
You 
talked about taxes. Our other Con-
gressman friend did as well. 
In this bill, there are 21 tax increases 
by the definition of the Court, but I 
want to talk about two in particular 
because I believe, when we look back 
on the American system of a once lim-
ited government, this day, June 28, 
2012, will stand as the definitive date in 
the advance of government tyranny. In 
today’s ruling, a slim majority of the 
Court turned the Constitution on its 
head and ruled that the Federal Gov-
ernment, in effect, can force upon the 
American people anything it darned 
well pleases so long as it’s called a 
‘‘tax.’’ 
Let’s not forget that, when our 
Founding Fathers put everything on 
the line, risking life, limb, and prop-
erty to make us an independent Na-
tion, they did so in order to ensure that 
no man was taxed without representa-
tion. They also asserted that every 
man and woman has inalienable rights 
that are not to be violated by the gov-
ernment. They enshrined these con-
cepts in the Declaration of Independ-
ence and, ultimately, in our Constitu-
tion. 
Today, in my opinion, the Supreme 
Court offered a perverse interpretation 
of the Bill of Rights. Just across the 
street from here, they said that, even 
though you have a right to do some-
thing, the decision to exercise that 
right will incur a tax. The decision to 
exercise that right, said the Chief Jus-
tice of the U.S. Supreme Court, will 
incur a tax. 
Can you imagine the limitless possi-
bilities for Washington? Why not ex-
tend this interpretation to other parts 
of the Constitution? For example, why 
not tax the exercise of your First 
Amendment rights? 
Sure, you’ve got First Amendment 
rights. Send your Member of Congress 
a letter, but pay a fine to the govern-
ment. That makes sense under this rul-
ing. Sell a newspaper or publish a blog. 
Don’t forget to tell the IRS and the 
new 16,500 agents they want to hire to 
enforce it. What about a right to a fair 
and speedy trial? That’s guaranteed, 
but you know, that’s yours to have but 
for a fee. 
That’s the lack of logic. For average 
Americans who love their Constitution, 
these are guaranteed. They’re not al-
lowed to be imposed if you pay the fine 
or the fee. 
One thing in particular I want to 
talk about, Congressman GRAVES, is 
that, in addition to this health insur-
ance mandate tax, the President’s 
health care law creates what is clearly 
a religion tax. A religion tax? Yes, you 
heard me right, and it’s even if you 
morally or ethically disagree with 
something being promoted. 
Right now, HHS Secretary Kathleen 
Sebelius and former Governor of Kan-
sas, look at her record. Most Ameri-
cans would completely disagree with 
her moral views, but if you disagree 
with her mandates of the President’s 
health care plan, it doesn’t matter. 
You will still have to pay for it. If you 
dare to follow your conscience and, 
maybe, actually practice your faith or 
no faith whatsoever and refuse to par-
ticipate, you will be fined. Why? You 
will be taxed because of what you be-
lieve and your desire to live it out. You 
will be forced to give your hard-earned 
money to the IRS in Washington, D.C., 
because of what you believe. That, my 
friends, is a religion tax. It’s a faith 
tax. It’s a direct attack on our freedom 
of religion. 
Now, today the Court didn’t rule on 
that. There are dozens and dozens and 
dozens of lawsuits coming on about the 
HHS 
mandate 
coming 
out 
of 
ObamaCare. This is the start: a tax on 
religion. 
I have an employer who sent me an 
email. He said, Well, Tim, everybody is 
talking about the individual mandate. 
What about the employer mandate? I 
don’t want to cover abortions for my 
employees. I refuse to participate. 
He will be fined $3,000 at a minimum 
for every single employee. Why? Be-
cause of what he believes. 
That’s why we started this country— 
for freedom to believe as we ought, not 
as the government or as the king or as

the Chief Justice would have us be-
lieve. But they didn’t address this di-
rectly in this decision; they’ll be com-
ing. This is a shocking attack, I be-
lieve, on the first supreme right in the 
First Amendment, which is the right to 
believe in and follow the God one 
chooses. 
now to turn to its taxing power, as Mr. 
HUELSKAMP said. 
This law was sold to us as a mandate 
and not a tax. It was reaffirmed by the 
President that this is not a tax. Yet, 
when the arguments were made to its 
constitutionality, this administration 
took the position that it was a tax, and 
the Court agreed. 
Let’s see the taxes. In 2010, an excise 
tax on charitable hospitals was en-
acted; the codification of the economic 
substance doctrine; a tax hike of $4.5 
billion was implemented; a black liq-
uor tax hike, a tax that increases on 
the type of biofuel; a tax on innovator 
drug 
companies 
was 
enacted; 
a 
BlueCross/BlueShield tax hike was en-
acted; a tax on indoor canning services 
was enacted; a medicine cabinet tax, so 
that Americans are no longer able to 
use their FSAs, flexible spending ac-
counts, or HRAs, their health reim-
bursement pretax dollars to purchase 
nonprescription over-the-counter medi-
cine was implemented; the HSA with-
draw tax hike was implemented; a tax 
that will take effect this year, the em-
ployer reporting of insurance on W–4s. 
Where are they going with that, Mr. 
GRAVES? Where are they going with 
that? 
Remember, not long ago we had a big 
debate about that, that now we’re 
going to report to the IRS the amount 
of your insurance policy that your em-
ployer gives you on your W–4, because 
they want to tax that as income. 
And then taxes that will take effect 
in 2013: a surtax on investment income; 
a hike in the medical payroll tax. 
Wait, the medical payroll tax? I 
thought we had a payroll tax holiday. 
Not in 2013. We’re going to get an in-
crease. 
A tax on medical device manufactur-
ers; a flexible spending account cap 
that is going to affect those parents 
who have special needs kids. 
So those parents who have special 
needs kids that the other side of this 
aisle claims to always want to rep-
resent, this health care law is now 
going to tax. 
An elimination of the tax deduction 
for employers that cover prescription 
drugs; a $500,000 annual executive com-
pensation limit; an individual mandate 
excise tax; an employer mandate excise 
tax; a tax on health insurers. 
And last but not least, in 2018, an ex-
cise tax on comprehensive health in-
surance plans, which will affect union 
employees. 
This ladder of success that we had in 
this country has now had three rings of 
it removed, because now the govern-
ment tells the individual, if you live 
below a certain poverty line, you will 
be given food, shelter, and now health 
care tax free, no requirement by you 
who is receiving these, to pay anything 
back to the government, zero. 
b 1910 
What is the incentive to climb? Be-
cause the moment you start to climb, 
you lose these amenities and the gov-
ernment starts to take from you. So 
We’re leading the world, and now is 
the time to take back our government, 
take back our Constitution, and take 
back power out of Washington, D.C. 
I appreciate the leadership of the 
gentleman from Georgia. 
Mr. GRAVES of Georgia. I thank the 
gentleman from Kansas for your words. 
Regarding unintended consequences, 
I can tell you there are going to be an 
amazing amount of unintended con-
sequences with the Affordable Care 
Act, which I’m not sure that we can 
call it that anymore. I think it’s more 
like the Limited Care Act. It’s the 
Very Expensive Care Act. 
For the Progressives that were here 
earlier—and I know many folks lis-
tened to them—they were celebrating. 
They were excited. They were happy, 
gleeful; whereas, we’re lamenting but 
resolved to do away with this once and 
for all. 
Why would they be gleeful? Because 
it’s 
their 
movement. 
That’s 
what 
they’ve been trying to do now for al-
most 100 years, and that is increase the 
size of government, get it into the lives 
of the American people, dictate their 
behavior, and limit freedom. 
I read recently that part of their 
agenda is to divorce the Declaration of 
Independence and the Constitution. 
But to use one and to prop up on that 
one so they can almost sort of claim 
that they are for the founding of this 
Nation—and we heard earlier when 
they used the Declaration of Independ-
ence: life, liberty, and the pursuit of 
happiness. They were celebrating that 
this was the right bill to be in law be-
cause of life, liberty, and the pursuit of 
happiness. If you can claim that with 
this legislation, there are no bounds in 
which you can go with this Federal 
Government, there are no limits. 
As the gentleman from Kansas just 
raised, this is clearly not about health 
care. This is about freedom, and this is 
about liberty and preserving it for fu-
ture generations. 
I would like to yield to the gen-
tleman from Louisiana (Mr. LANDRY). 
Mr. 
LANDRY. 
Thank 
you, 
Mr. 
GRAVES. 
Mr. HUELSKAMP
was just on the 
mark. I will venture to say that to-
day’s ruling actually extinguishes the 
fire of life, liberty, and the pursuit of 
happiness. It destroys life, liberty, and 
that pursuit. 
The question today for this country 
can best be summed up by President 
Ronald Reagan when he said, back in 
the 1960s, in a speech: 
Will history write that those who had 
the most to lose did the least to pre-
vent it from happening? 
This is a sad and tragic day for the 
Constitution. Where are the limits of 
our government? While the Court has 
answered that the Commerce Clause 
does have its limits and gives us that 
ruling, it takes away by saying that 
Congress has unlimited taxing power. 
Its limits are unlimited. I guess that 
Congress now, when it sees fit to regu-
late an issue, an industry, need only 
b 1900 
The Supreme Court may not have 
dealt ObamaCare the death it deserved, 
but it’s incumbent upon each and every 
one of us here in Congress and each and 
every American. I would have loved to 
have witnessed a home run, knock it 
out of the park and say it’s clearly un-
constitutional. Again, if Justice Kagan 
had been ethical, it would have been a 
4–4 decision. They didn’t worry about 
that. Ethics doesn’t matter. It’s just 
the end. It’s kind of the Progressive 
Caucus approach. The end justifies the 
means, but not in America. 
I ask all Americans to realize this de-
cision is not about health care. It’s 
about liberty. When we have created 
and designed a method by which future 
Congresses, future Presidents, can get 
around any limit in the Constitution— 
the Constitution is a limit on my 
power, on every power of every Member 
in this Chamber and every Member 
across the way and every President of 
the United States. That’s what the 
Constitution does. It doesn’t empower 
us. It takes away our power. 
This Court today has said, if you call 
it a tax, if you use those three words— 
even though the Chief Justice says ‘‘la-
bels don’t matter.’’ He said labels don’t 
matter, and then he turns around and 
says the word ‘‘tax’’ does matter. If 
you do that, it makes it suddenly con-
stitutional—anything you do, includ-
ing attacking the very faith that is 
held by the Chief Justice himself. It 
says, You cannot hold that faith, Mr. 
Chief Justice, unless you’re willing to 
be fined by your own government. 
That is a travesty of justice in this 
country. 
What this means is we cannot over-
turn this with this President in the 
White House. This has taken an issue, 
and people are ready to work on it and 
say, You know what? This is going to 
be the issue for November 6. This is the 
choice. Do you want the government to 
mandate and control everything in 
your lives, as long as they use that 
magic word? They love to use the 
‘‘tax’’ word. If you allow them to do 
that, you allow them to be in every 
part of your life, which is an absolute 
contradiction to what this country was 
founded upon. 
I appreciate the leadership of many 
in this room. I am just a freshman. I 
was not here when this debate started 
last time, as some of these colleagues 
who have been fighting all along. But I 
tell you, if the folks in the First Dis-
trict of Kansas are any indication of 
what Americans are saying all over, 
this is the time. They’re going to dust 
off that Constitution. They’re going to 
read it and say, My goodness. I don’t 
want to lose this. It’s too precious.

the rule of law, to uphold the Constitu-
tion, and to adhere to those funda-
mental principles, especially in health 
care—the principles of affordability 
and 
accessibility 
and 
quality 
and 
choices for the American people. 
The bad news was written today. The 
good news is that you can solve all of 
these challenges in health care without 
putting the Federal Government in 
charge of the thing. We’ve got the solu-
tions. We’ve talked about them before. 
We’ll be going on the road now talking 
about them from now until November, 
because the American people want to 
know that there is somebody fighting 
for them in this town on their behalf. 
And we are. 
What we need from the American 
people is for them to stand up and say, 
No more. We will not tolerate a govern-
ment that will reach into our lives and 
destroy quality health care in this 
country to the degree that the Court 
said it was okay to do today. 
I thank my friend for the wonderful 
work you are doing and for yielding me 
this time. 
Mr. GRAVES of Georgia. I thank the 
gentleman from Georgia. 
Not only are you a physician—you 
are not here speaking on behalf of phy-
sicians. You are here speaking on be-
half of patients all across this country 
and defending them. And I appreciate 
the great fight that you are putting on 
and the resolve that you have for each 
of us, as you are leading us here as Re-
publicans here in the House. 
As we go into the last 5 minutes here 
with the gentleman from Utah (Mr. 
BISHOP), he brought up the government 
right now taxes us on what we do or 
consume, but this is a first in which 
the government can now tax you on 
what you don’t do. That’s an amazing 
concept. I hadn’t really thought of it 
that way until Mr. PRICE brought it up. 
So now the Federal Government has 
moved into a realm which has never 
been here before, saying, Hey, because 
you’re not doing something, I’m going 
to tax you. So I’m going to determine 
what it is that you should be doing 
that you are not doing so, therefore, I 
can collect a little revenue. And here 
we are today with something such as 
this. 
As we are just wrapping up this spir-
ited 
discussion 
here, 
earlier, 
Mr. 
BISHOP, you heard the Progressives 
celebrating this decision today. 
What were they celebrating? The 
Federal Government can tax you if you 
do something. But today’s celebration 
was the fact that the Federal Govern-
ment can tax you when you don’t do 
something. 
I appreciate you joining us tonight 
and giving your thoughts from the 
great State of Utah. 
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. I appreciate the 
gentleman for yielding me a few mo-
ments here. Truly, this is a unique day. 
And I’m happy to join my colleagues in 
talking about this particular issue. 
You know, the old cliche is simply, a 
Supreme Court decision should not be 
the decision becomes, can I jump high 
enough to grab a rung so that I can 
then start paying back and get more of 
the amenities that the government was 
giving us and I was provided? 
Let me conclude as I began, by ask-
ing: Will those who have the most to 
lose do the least to prevent it from 
happening? And as I spend time in this 
city, I have come to realize that the gi-
ants of America who have been memo-
rialized for their great contributions to 
our society did not contribute with the 
goal of being memorialized but did 
what was right and just in the eyes of 
the Lord, with no ego and no agenda 
other than for the greater good. And 
that is what this country so des-
perately needs. We need those giants. 
Mr. GRAVES of Georgia. I thank the 
gentleman from Louisiana. 
You brought up one major compo-
nent of all this legislation. I remember 
in one of the State of the Unions, the 
President said, We need tax reform. 
Tax reform. 
I think he got tax reform in this law. 
What did you say? Twenty-one new 
taxes are being implemented because of 
ObamaCare? There are 21 new taxes, 
and yet the Progressives earlier said, 
No, this is great for America. Free 
health care. Affordable health care. No 
one has to pay. They’ll actually get 
credits back. 
Somebody’s got to pay. That’s the 
way 
this 
place 
works. 
Whenever 
they’re 
promising 
you 
something, 
they’re taking from someone else. And 
you just laid out 21 different areas that 
impact every American that the Presi-
dent promised he wouldn’t raise taxes 
on. So I appreciate you doing that. 
And next, the other component of it 
is, what’s left? What really was in this 
health care law, this Big Government 
expansion, this overreach into the 
homes of American families? A tremen-
dous amount is left. 
I know Dr. PRICE from Georgia has 
been leading the fight not only against 
this measure, but for positive patient- 
centered and patient-driven measures 
as well. And I want to thank you for 
joining us and sharing with us. 
Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Thank you, 
Mr. GRAVES, so very much. I want to 
commend you for your work on this 
issue and your leadership for principled 
solutions, principled solutions in the 
area of health care and everywhere 
else. 
I know that Republicans think every 
day is the Fourth of July and Demo-
crats think that every day is April 15. 
Why would I say that? Today we’ve 
been highlighting it in this conversa-
tion we’re having here, because our 
friends on the other side of the aisle be-
lieve that every day is another day to 
raise taxes. 
Today the Supreme Court of the 
United States said, If you want to raise 
taxes, have at it. Raise them as high as 
you want. In fact, the Democrats are so 
incredibly happy this day because it’s 
not just that they can now raise taxes 
or fight to raise taxes on what we do, 
but goodness gracious, they can fight 
to raise taxes on what we don’t do. In 
fact, if you don’t do something, then 
the Federal Government can say, Oh, 
you’d better do that or we’re going to 
raise your taxes. And that is exactly 
what the Court said today, which 
confounds and astounds everybody. 
I was privileged to sit in the Court 
today, though, and hear the reading of 
the ruling, and Chief Justice Roberts 
said one thing that I found very, very 
interesting. He said, ‘‘It’s not our job 
to protect citizens from their political 
decisions.’’ 
‘‘It’s not our job to protect citizens 
from their political decisions.’’ And 
that’s exactly what this was. This deci-
sion was fixed on Election Day in 2008. 
This decision came down on Election 
Day 2008. 
As a physician, I want to talk for a 
very brief moment here about the in-
credible importance of Election Day 
2012 because, as you said, Mr. GRAVES, 
there are a lot of things in this bill 
that we’re not just talking about 
money. As a physician, I know what 
we’re talking about is people’s lives, 
the health care of the American people. 
And nothing could be so important, 
nothing could be so personal. 
And what the Court said today is, Let 
the things in there stand. The $500 bil-
lion reduction, the $500 billion decrease 
from the Medicare program—taking 
the Medicare program and saying, You 
don’t need that money, seniors in this 
country. You don’t need that money. 
We’re going to use it over here. 
What does that mean? What that 
means is that those seniors—your par-
ents, your grandparents, the parents 
and grandparents of this great country, 
the people of the Greatest Generation 
cited by this country, are now going to 
have diminished health care. 
And how are they going to do it? 
They’re not going to do it through the 
front door. They’re not going to say, 
We’re going to decrease this care for 
you transparently, openly. Oh, no. 
They’re going to do it through the 
backdoor, something called the Inde-
pendent Payment Advisory Board that 
we’ve talked about before, the 15-mem-
ber bureaucratic panel. Nonelected in-
dividuals are going to have the power, 
under this law, to say, Dr. Smith, you 
can’t do that for Mrs. Jones. If you do 
it, we’re not going to pay you. That’s 
the coercive power of this government. 
That’s the coercive power that this 
Court today said is okay. 
Well, Mr. GRAVES, you and I both 
know that it’s not okay for us, and it’s 
not okay for the American people. And 
that’s why we stand here tonight, and 
we say with every ounce of our being 
that the election that occurred in 2008 
may have written this in stone, but 
there are some sandblasters out there. 
And what we’re going to do between 
now and the first Tuesday in November 
is to make certain that the American 
people understand and appreciate that 
there are folks in this town who are 
fighting as hard as we can to uphold

confused 
with 
constitutional 
prin-
ciples. Today we had one case brought 
by States to the Supreme Court. And 
the administration has always said, 
This ObamaCare is not a tax. It is not 
a tax. 
Well, the Court said, on five of the 
nine decisions, Yes, it is a tax. And I 
guess it’s legal if you call it a tax. Four 
of the nine said not even that’s good 
enough; but, nonetheless, it’s a tax. 
the Highway Trust Fund pending enactment 
of a multiyear law reauthorizing such pro-
grams, and for other purposes, having met, 
after full and free conference, have agreed to 
recommend and do recommend to their re-
spective Houses as follows: 
That the House recede from its disagree-
ment to the amendment of the Senate to the 
text of the bill and agree to the same with an 
amendment as follows: 
In lieu of the matter proposed to be in-
serted by the Senate amendment, insert the 
following: 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; ORGANIZATION OF ACT 
INTO DIVISIONS; TABLE OF CON-
TENTS. 
(a) SHORT TITLE.—This Act may be cited as 
the ‘‘Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Cen-
tury Act’’ or the ‘‘MAP–21’’. 
(b) DIVISIONS.—This Act is organized into 8 
divisions as follows: 
(1) Division A–Federal-aid Highways and 
Highway Safety Construction Programs. 
(2) Division B–Public Transportation. 
(3) Division C–Transportation Safety and Sur-
face Transportation Policy. 
(4) Division D–Finance. 
(5) Division E–Research and Education. 
(6) Division F–Miscellaneous. 
(7) Division G–Surface Transportation Exten-
sion. 
(8) Division H–Budgetary Effects. 
(c) TABLE OF CONTENTS.—The table of con-
tents for this Act is as follows: 
States to be involved in this discussion 
because it impacts those States. Right 
now, they simply have to accept what 
takes place here in the rarified air by 
the Potomac River. 
But, indeed, if we gave the States a 
tool so if enough States were to ban to-
gether to say, No, we disagree with this 
rule, we disagree with this regulation, 
we disagree with this law, we even dis-
agree with this Supreme Court deci-
sion, the States would have the ability 
to add a new check and a new balance 
to make sure that the common people 
of this country have some kind of voice 
in these decisions. 
I think one of the things we should 
learn from today’s decision is that we 
desperately need another check and 
balance in our process to make fed-
eralism a realistic and real term, and 
that means to involve the States in 
giving them some powers to have real 
decisions, not so they have to come to 
us as they have so far, begging, but so 
they can actually have a say. I think 
we would be better off as a Nation if we 
did it. 
This decision today, if nothing more, 
should add a resolve for us to solve a 
political problem politically, to do it 
here in the Halls of Congress, but 
maybe add another player in this proc-
ess—the States—so they also have a 
say in this power to tax, which is the 
power to destroy. 
I realize we’re coming close to time. 
I want to give my good friend from 
Georgia the chance of giving the final 
word on this particular issue, and I ap-
preciate his efforts to organize this op-
portunity to talk about what has hap-
pened today. 
Mr. GRAVES of Georgia. Thank you 
for your comments tonight and your 
great insight and reflecting back on 
early documents and early words that 
have been shared. 
Mr. Speaker, as we conclude tonight, 
I want the American people to know 
that we are resolved to restore the lib-
erty that was lost today through the 
full repeal of ObamaCare. That will be 
our focus as Republicans in the House. 
I yield back the balance of my time.

b 1920 
It’s appropriate that we talk about 
that power of taxing because the most 
famous of all cases, McCulloch v. 
Maryland, which was one the major de-
cisions actually made in this particular 
building, simply said the power to tax 
is the power to destroy. And we have 
that in front of us right now. 
I don’t think we should’ve expected 
judges to do what the legislative 
branch—in this case, Congress—ought 
do. And I think it’s positive that we 
move forward in this effort to make 
sure that this program does not go into 
effect and we take concerns for our 
constituents and maybe even learn 
something from it. 
The idea of judicial review didn’t 
exist for the first decade and a half of 
this country. Marbury v. Madison 
didn’t happen until almost 15 years 
into the country. Washington, in the 
Constitutional 
Convention, 
also 
thought the veto should be what deter-
mined constitutionality, kind of execu-
tive review, and Jefferson always said 
there should be legislative review. 
So I think perhaps our Founding Fa-
thers thought all branches should be 
involved in that kind of concept. And I 
think there should be a fourth one 
added to it, which is the States at the 
same time, who started this process of 
going to the courts. But we don’t come 
on this floor often and quote anti-Fed-
eralists because they lost. However, I 
want to today, because even though 
they were wrong on the Constitution, 
every once in a while they were right 
on some of the concepts. 
So in the ‘‘17th Letter from a Fed-
eralist Farmer,’’ written either by 
Melancthon Smith or one of the Lees of 
Virginia—no one really knows who ac-
tually did it—he talked about this idea 
that the States, if we have the concept 
of federalism, should have some power 
to do some real things. He simply said: 
I have often heard it observed that our peo-
ple are well informed and will not submit to 
oppressive governments, that the State gov-
ernments will be ready advocates. But of 
what avail will these circumstances be if the 
State governments, thus allowed to be 
guardians of the people, possess no kind of 
power to stop the laws of Congress injurious 
to the people? 
One of the things they quickly said is 
States really don’t have the concept or 
the power to actually involve them-
selves in this particular issue. There 
are some concepts that are out there. 
The repeal amendment, which is pro-
posed by some legal scholars and has 
been proposed by some State organiza-
tions, would actually give a tool for

Century (Public Law 105–178; 112 Stat. 107), yet 
continued improvement to bridge conditions is 
essential to protect the safety of the traveling 
public and allow for the efficient movement of 
people and goods on which the economy of the 
United States relies; and 
‘‘(B) the systematic preventative maintenance

ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—In preparing a final envi-
ronmental impact statement under the National 
Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 
et seq.), if the lead agency modifies the state-
ment in response to comments that are minor 
and are confined to factual corrections or expla-
nations of why the comments do not warrant 
additional agency response, the lead agency 
may write on errata sheets attached to the state-
ment instead of rewriting the draft statement, 
subject to the condition that the errata sheets— 
(1) cite the sources, authorities, or reasons 
that support the position of the agency; and 
(2) if appropriate, indicate the circumstances 
that would trigger agency reappraisal or further 
response. 
(b) INCORPORATION.—To the maximum extent 
practicable, the lead agency shall expeditiously 
develop a single document that consists of a 
final environmental impact statement and a 
record of decision, unless— 
(1) the final environmental impact statement 
makes substantial changes to the proposed ac-
tion that are relevant to environmental or safety 
concerns; or 
(2) there are significant new circumstances or 
information relevant to environmental concerns 
and that bear on the proposed action or the im-
pacts of the proposed action. 
SEC. 1320. MEMORANDA OF AGENCY AGREE-
MENTS FOR EARLY COORDINATION. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—It is the sense of Congress 
that— 
(1) the Secretary and other Federal agencies 
with relevant jurisdiction in the environmental 
review process should cooperate with each other 
and other agencies on environmental review and 
project delivery activities at the earliest prac-
ticable time to avoid delays and duplication of 
effort later in the process, head off potential 
conflicts, and ensure that planning and project 
development decisions reflect environmental val-
ues; and 
(2) such cooperation should include the devel-
opment of policies and the designation of staff 
that advise planning agencies or project spon-
sors of studies or other information foreseeably 
required for later Federal action and early con-
sultation with appropriate State and local agen-
cies and Indian tribes. 
(b) TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE.—If requested at 
any time by a State or local planning agency, 
the Secretary and other Federal agencies with 
relevant jurisdiction in the environmental re-
view process, shall, to the extent practicable and 
appropriate, as determined by the agencies, pro-
vide technical assistance to the State or local 
planning agency on accomplishing the early co-
ordination activities described in subsection (d). 
(c) MEMORANDUM OF AGENCY AGREEMENT.—If 
requested at any time by a State or local plan-
ning agency, the lead agency, in consultation 
with other Federal agencies with relevant juris-
diction in the environmental review process, 
may establish memoranda of agreement with the 
project sponsor, State, and local governments 
and other appropriate entities to accomplish the 
early coordination activities described in sub-
section (d). 
(d) EARLY COORDINATION ACTIVITIES.—Early 
coordination activities shall include, to the max-
imum extent practicable, the following: 
(1) Technical assistance on identifying poten-
tial impacts and mitigation issues in an inte-
grated fashion.

Than Construction and Maintenance of High-

SEC. 1536. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON HARBOR 
MAINTENANCE. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds that— 
(1) there are 926 coastal, Great Lakes, and in-
land harbors maintained by the Corps of Engi-
neers; 
(2) according to the Bureau of Transportation 
Statistics— 
(A) in 2009, the ports and waterways of the 
United States handled more than 2,200,000,000 
short tons of imports, exports, and domestic 
shipments; and 
(B) in 2010, United States ports were respon-
sible for more than $1,400,000,000,000 in water-
borne imports and exports; 
(3) according to the Congressional Research 
Service, full channel dimensions are, on aver-
age, available approximately 1⁄3 of the time at 
the 59 harbors of the United States with the 
highest use rates; 
(4) in 1986, Congress created the Harbor Main-
tenance Trust Fund to provide funds for the op-
eration and maintenance of the navigation 
channels of the United States; 
(5) in fiscal year 2012, the Harbor Mainte-
nance Trust Fund is expected to grow from 
$6,280,000,000 to $7,011,000,000, an increase of 
approximately 13 percent; 
(6) despite growth of the Harbor Maintenance 
Trust Fund, expenditures from the Harbor 
Maintenance Trust Fund have not been suffi-
ciently spent; and 
(7) inadequate investment in dredging needs is 
restricting access to the ports of the United 
States for domestic shipping, imports, and ex-
ports and therefore threatening the economic 
competitiveness of the United States. 
(b) SENSE
OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that— 
(1) the Administration should request full use 
of the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund for op-
erating and maintaining the navigation chan-
nels of the United States; 
(2) the amounts in the Harbor Maintenance 
Trust Fund should be fully expended to operate 
and maintain the navigation channels of the 
United States; and 
(3) Congress should ensure that other pro-
grams, projects, and activities of the Civil Works 
Program of the Corps of Engineers, especially 
those programs, projects, and activities relating 
to inland navigation and flood control, are not 
adversely impacted.

cipient of assistance under this chapter may

icing standard flood insurance policies, includ-
ing how such companies shall be reimbursed in

tives. 
(e) STUDY AND REPORT ON GRADUATED RISK.— 
(1) STUDY.— 
(A) 
STUDY
REQUIRED.—The 
Administrator 
shall enter into a contract under which the Na-
tional Academy of Sciences shall conduct a 
study exploring methods for understanding 
graduated risk behind levees and the associated 
land development, insurance, and risk commu-
nication dimensions. 
(B) CONTENTS
OF
STUDY.—The study under 
this paragraph shall— 
(i) research, review, and recommend current 
best practices for estimating direct annualized 
flood losses behind levees for residential and 
commercial structures; 
(ii) rank each best practice recommended 
under clause (i) based on the best value, bal-
ancing cost, scientific integrity, and the inher-
ent uncertainties associated with all aspects of 
the loss estimate, including geotechnical engi-
neering, flood frequency estimates, economic 
value, and direct damages; 
(iii) research, review, and identify current 
best floodplain management and land use prac-
tices behind levees that effectively balance so-
cial, economic, and environmental consider-
ations as part of an overall flood risk manage-
ment strategy; 
(iv) identify areas in which the best floodplain 
management and land use practices described in 
clause (iii) have proven effective and recommend 
methods and processes by which such practices 
could be applied more broadly across the United 
States, given the variety of different flood risks, 
State and local legal frameworks, and evolving 
judicial opinions; 
(v) research, review, and identify a variety of 
flood insurance pricing options for flood haz-
ards behind levees that are actuarially sound 
and based on the flood risk data developed 
using the 3 best practices recommended under 
clause (i) that have the best value as determined 
under clause (ii); 
(vi) evaluate and recommend methods to re-
duce insurance costs through creative arrange-
ments between insureds and insurers while 
keeping a clear accounting of how much finan-
cial risk is being borne by various parties such 
that the entire risk is accounted for, including 
establishment of explicit limits on disaster aid or 
other assistance in the event of a flood; and 
(vii) 
taking 
into 
consideration 
the 
rec-
ommendations under clauses (i) through (iii), 
recommend approaches to communicate the as-
sociated risks to community officials, home-
owners, and other residents of communities. 
(2) REPORT.—The contract under paragraph 
(1)(A) shall provide that not later than 12 
months after the date of enactment of this Act, 
the National Academy of Sciences shall submit 
to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and

tions for the best manner to accomplish the pri-
vatization described in paragraph (1). 
(b) PRIVATE RISK-MANAGEMENT INITIATIVES.— 
The Administrator may carry out such private 
risk-management initiatives as are otherwise au-
thorized under applicable law, as the Adminis-
trator considers appropriate to determine the ca-
pacity of private insurers, reinsurers, and finan-
cial markets to assist communities, on a vol-
untary basis only, in managing the full range of 
financial risks associated with flooding. 
(c) REINSURANCE ASSESSMENT.— 
(1) PRIVATE
MARKET
PRICING
ASSESSMENT.— 
Not later than 12 months after the date of enact-
ment of this Act, the Administrator shall submit 
to Congress a report that— 
(A) assesses the capacity of the private rein-
surance, capital, and financial markets to assist 
communities, on a voluntary basis, in managing 
of the Senate and the Committee on Financial

(1) the number of flood insurance policy hold-
ers currently insuring— 
(A) a residential structure up to the maximum 
available coverage amount, as established in 
section 61.6 of title 44, Code of Federal Regula-
tions, of— 
(i) $250,000 for the structure; and 
(ii) $100,000 for the contents of such structure; 
or 
(B) a commercial structure up to the maximum 
available coverage amount, as established in 
section 61.6 of title 44, Code of Federal Regula-
tions, of $500,000; 
(2) the increased losses the National Flood In-
surance Program would have sustained during 
the 2004 and 2005 hurricane season if the Na-
tional Flood Insurance Program had insured all 
policyholders up to the maximum conforming 
loan limit for fiscal year 2006 of $417,000, as es-
tablished under section 302(b)(2) of the Federal 
National Mortgage Association Charter Act (12 
U.S.C. 1717(b)(2)); 
(3) the availability in the private marketplace 
of flood insurance coverage in amounts that ex-
ceed the current limits of coverage amounts es-
tablished in section 61.6 of title 44, Code of Fed-
eral Regulations; and 
(4) what effect, if any— 
(A) raising the current limits of coverage 
amounts established in section 61.6 of title 44, 
Code of Federal Regulations, would have on the 
ability of private insurers to continue providing 
flood insurance coverage; and 
(B) reducing the current limits of coverage 
amounts established in section 61.6 of title 44, 
Code of Federal Regulations, would have on the 
ability of private insurers to provide sufficient 
flood insurance coverage to effectively replace 
the current level of flood insurance coverage 
being provided under the National Flood Insur-
ance Program.

THE 
PARTICIPATION 
OF 
INDIAN 
TRIBES AND MEMBERS OF INDIAN 
TRIBES IN THE NATIONAL FLOOD IN-
SURANCE PROGRAM. 
(a) DEFINITION.—In this section, the term ‘‘In-
dian tribe’’ has the meaning given that term in 
section 4 of the Indian Self-Determination and 
Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 450b).

assessment of the current state of the market for 
natural catastrophe insurance in the United 
States. 
(b) FACTORS.—The study and report required 
under subsection (a) shall assess— 
(1) the current condition of, as well as the 
outlook for, the availability and affordability of 
insurance for natural catastrophe perils in all 
regions of the United States; 
(2) the current ability of States, communities, 
and individuals to mitigate their natural catas-
trophe risks, including the affordability and 
feasibility of such mitigation activities;

and reinsurance markets and the current ap-
proaches in providing insurance protection to 
different sectors of the population of the United 
States; 
(4) the current financial condition of State re-
sidual markets and catastrophe funds in high- 
risk regions, including the likelihood of insol-
vency following a natural catastrophe, the con-
centration of risks within such funds, the reli-
ance on post-event assessments and State fund-
ing, and the adequacy of rates; and 
(5) the current role of the Federal Government 
and State and local governments in providing 
incentives for feasible risk mitigation efforts and 
the cost of providing post-natural catastrophe 
aid in the absence of insurance. 
(c) ADDITIONAL FACTORS.—The study and re-
port required under subsection (a) shall also 
contain an assessment of current approaches to 
insuring natural catastrophe risks in the United 
States and such other information as the Direc-
tor of the Federal Insurance Office determines

JOINT EXPLANATORY STATEMENT OF 
THE COMMITTEE OF THE CONFERENCE 
The managers on the part of the Senate 
and the House at the conference on the dis-
agreeing votes of the two Houses on the 
amendment of the Senate to the bill ( H.R. 
4348), to provide an extension of Federal-aid 
highway, highway safety, motor carrier safe-
ty, transit, and other programs funded out of 
the Highway Trust Fund pending enactment 
of a multiyear law reauthorizing such pro-
grams, and for other purposes, submit the 
following joint statement to the House and 
the Senate in explanation of the effect of the 
action agreed upon by the managers and rec-
ommended in the accompanying conference 
report: 
The House recedes from its disagreement 
to the amendment of the Senate to the text 
of the bill and agrees to the same with an 
amendment. 
A summary of the bill agreed to in con-
ference is set forth below: 
Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Cen-
tury (MAP–21) replaces the previous author-
ization, the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Effi-
cient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy 
for Users (SAFETEA–LU), that expired on 
September 30, 2009 and which has been con-
tinued with a series of short-term exten-
sions. MAP–21 will modernize and reform our 
current transportation system to help create 
jobs, accelerate economic recovery, and 
build the foundation for long-term pros-
perity. This conference report makes a num-
ber of necessary changes in the Federal-aid 
highway program structure to increase State 
flexibility and better serve the American 
people. 
DIVISION 
A—FEDERAL-AID 
HIGHWAYS 
AND HIGHWAY SAFETY CONSTRUCTION 
PROGRAMS 
Highway funding levels 
The conference report provides funding for 
the federal-aid highway program through fis-
cal 2014 at current funding levels with a 
small inflationary adjustment. 
Program consolidation 
The Senate and the House both sought to 
consolidate the number of programs in the 
federal-aid highway program to focus prior-
ities and resources on key national goals. 
The conference report consolidates the num-
ber of highway programs by two-thirds. The 
elimination of dozens of programs makes 
more resources available to States and met-
ropolitan areas to invest in their most crit-
ical needs to improve the condition and per-
formance of their transportation system. 
Project delivery 
The conference report combined provisions 
from the House and Senate bills focusing on 
the shared priority of accelerating project 
delivery. It maintains the vast majority of 
project acceleration provisions from S. 1813 
and provisions from the House bill in addi-
tion to new provisions that will maintain 
substantive environment and public health 
protections while streamlining the creation 
and use of documents and environmental re-
views, enhancing efficiency and account-
ability in the project delivery process. 
The conference report adopts and modifies 
provisions from the House bill directing the 
Secretary to designate, through rulemaking, 
certain activities as categorical exclusions 
under the National Environmental Policy 
Act. The Secretary is directed to designate 
the repair or reconstruction of a road, high-
way, or bridge damaged by a declared emer-
gency or disaster as a categorical exclusion, 
if the repair or reconstruction project is in 
the same location and with the same speci-
fications as the original project and is com-
menced within two years of the declaration 
of emergency or disaster. The Secretary is 
also directed to designate any project within 
the existing operational right-of-way as a 
categorical exclusion and defines the term 
‘‘operational 
right-of-way’’. 
Additionally, 
the 
Secretary 
is 
directed 
to 
designate 
projects receiving limited Federal assistance 
as a categorical exclusion. The categorical 
exclusion applies to any project that re-
ceives less than $5,000,000 in Federal funds 
and any project with a total estimated cost 
of not more than $30,000,000 receiving Federal 
funds comprising less than 15 percent of the 
total estimated project costs. 
Performance measures 
The nation’s surface transportation pro-
grams have not provided sufficient account-
ability for how tax dollars are being spent on 
transportation projects and would benefit 
from a greater focus on key national prior-
ities. The conference report focuses the high-
way program on key outcomes, such as re-
ducing fatalities, improving road and bridge 
conditions, reducing congestion, increasing 
system reliability, and improving freight 
movement and economic vitality. 
Focus on the National Highway System 
The conference report combines the old 
interstate maintenance program into a new 
program called the National Highway Per-
formance Program to address both the inter-
state system as well as an extended National 
Highway System. It is these roads that are 
most critical to our economic vitality, and 
the conference report ensures the roads and 
bridges that make up this system will be bet-
ter maintained. 
Freight policy 
A top priority of the nation’s transpor-
tation system should be the safe and effi-
cient movement of goods. The nation’s eco-
nomic health is reliant upon a transpor-
tation system that provides for reliable and 
timely goods movement. 
This conference report establishes policies 
to improve freight movement. It calls for the 
development of a National Freight Strategic 
Plan, encourages state freight plans and ad-
visory committees, and provides incentives 
for states that fund projects to improve 
freight movement. 
America fast forward 
Given our massive investment needs and 
the limited funding available, we need to 
find ways to better leverage Federal dollars 
by encouraging additional non-Federal in-
vestment and helping to accelerate the bene-
fits of State and locally funded transpor-
tation projects. 
This conference report builds upon the suc-
cess of the TIFIA program to help commu-
nities 
leverage 
their 
transportation 
re-
sources and stretch Federal dollars further 
than they have been stretched before. The 
conference report modifies the TIFIA pro-
gram by increasing funding for the program 
to $1 billion per year, by increasing the max-
imum share of project costs from 33 percent 
to 49 percent, by allowing TIFIA to be used 
to support a related set of projects, and by 
setting aside funding for projects in rural 
areas at more favorable terms. 
Gulf Coast restoration 
The conference report modifies a Senate 
provision related to Gulf Coast restoration 
known as the Resources and Ecosystems 
Sustainability, Tourism Opportunities and 
Revived Economies of the Gulf Coast States 
Act of 2012 (RESTORE Act). The provision 
establishes the Gulf Coast Restoration Trust 
Fund and places in the Trust Fund 80% of all 
civil penalties paid by responsible parties in 
connection with the Deepwater Horizon oil 
spill. Funding may be used to invest in 
projects and activities to restore the long- 
term health of the coastal ecosystem and 
local economies in the Gulf Coast Region, 
which includes the states of Mississippi, Lou-
isiana, Alabama, Florida, and Texas. A por-
tion of the funds will be allocated directly 
and equally to the five Gulf Coast states for 
ecological and economic recovery along the 
coast. A portion will be provided to the Gulf 
Coast Ecosystem Restoration Council estab-
lished by the bill to develop and fund a com-
prehensive plan for the restoration of Gulf 
Coast ecosystems. A portion will be allo-
cated among the states using an impact- 
based formula to implement state plans that 
have been approved by the Council. Finally, 
a portion of the fines will be allocated to a 
Gulf Coast ecosystem restoration, science, 
observation, monitoring and technology pro-
gram and for grants to nongovernmental en-
tities for the establishment of Gulf Coast 
centers of excellence. 
Harbor maintenance 
The Conference report modifies a Senate 
provision highlighting the significance of the 
nation’s ports for efficient movement of 
goods and products and the need for in-
creased investment in the maintenance of 
these 
ports 
to 
promote 
the 
economic 
competiveness of the United States. The pro-

Administration should request and the Con-
gress should fully expend each year all of the 
revenues collected in the Harbor Mainte-
nance Trust Fund (HMTF) for the operation 
and maintenance of the nation’s federally 
maintained ports. The provision also ex-
presses the importance of protecting other 
critical Army Corps programs, including in-
land navigation, flood and coastal storm pro-
tection, and ecosystem restoration, from 
funding reductions. 
Finally, the provision directs the Adminis-
tration to provide an annual estimate of na-
tional harbor maintenance needs, including 
an estimate of the percentage of waterways 
that will be available for use based on the 
annual budget request as well as how much 
funding would be needed to achieve 95 per-
cent availability of the nation’s ports and 
waterways within 3 years 
DIVISION B—FEDERAL PUBLIC 
TRANSPORTATION ACT OF 2012 
The Federal Public Transportation Act of 
2012 contains historic improvements in safe-
ty oversight, streamlined review of new cap-
ital projects, program consolidation, and a 
shift from earmarks and discretionary pro-
grams to robust formula programs that pub-
lic transportation systems can rely on to up-
grade and improve aging infrastructure and 
vehicles. The Act provides increased funding 
levels for fiscal years 2013 and 2014 based on 
expected inflation, giving public transpor-
tation providers the stable funding needed to 
make essential investments. 
Secs. 20005 and 20006, 49 U.S.C. 5303/5304, metro-
politan and statewide transportation plan-
ning 
The Conference report improves metropoli-
tan and statewide planning processes to in-
corporate a more comprehensive perform-
ance-based approach. The conference com-
mittee requires the structure of all Metro-
politan Planning Organizations include offi-
cials of public agencies that administer or 
operate public transportation systems with-
in two years of enactment. 
The conference report creates a pilot pro-
gram for transit-oriented development plan-
ning to advance planning efforts that sup-
port transit-oriented development around 
fixed guideway capital investment projects. 
Grants for planning will help communities 
develop strategies to facilitate transit-ori-
ented development. 
Secs. 20007 and 20026, 49 U.S.C. 5307 and 5336, 
urbanized area formula grants 
Maintains the basic structure for urban-
ized area grants under Section 5307. The pro-
gram continues to be the largest program for 
federal investment in public transportation. 
The ‘‘Job Access and Reverse Commute’’ pro-
gram (JARC) has been moved to Section 5307 
and the conferees have removed the Senate 
bill set-aside for JARC activities. 
Maintains the existing criteria for use of 
5307 funds for capital projects (operating ex-
penses continue to be ineligible) in urban 
areas with a population greater than 200,000. 
In addition, the bill maintains language al-
lowing small urbanized areas with popu-
lations under 200,000 to use up to 100 percent 
of their 5307 funding for operating expenses. 
A modified ‘‘100 bus rule’’ has been included, 
allowing systems with 76–100 buses operating 
in peak service to use up to 50% of their 5307 
funding for operating expenses and those op-
erating 75 or fewer buses to use up to 75% for 
operating expenses. 
The Senate receded to the House request to 
remove a provision in the Senate bill estab-
lishing a program to allow public transpor-
tation providers temporary flexibility during 
periods of high unemployment to use a lim-
ited portion of their 5307 funds for up to two 
years for operating expenses. 
Sec. 20008, 49 U.S.C. 5309, Fixed Guideway Cap-
ital Investment Grants (new starts) 
Reforms and streamlines the ‘‘Fixed Guide-
way Capital Investment Grant’’ program 
(previously the ‘‘Major Capital Investment 
Grant’’ or ‘‘New Starts’’ program). Based on 
extensive feedback from project sponsors and 
other stakeholders, the bill streamlines the 
New Starts process to accelerate project de-
livery by eliminating duplicative steps in 
project development and instituting a modi-
fied program structure that will allow the 
Federal Transit Administration to review 
proposals quickly, without sacrificing effec-
tive project oversight. 
Projects under $100 million can utilize an 
expedited review process if they meet stand-
ards of similar highly qualified projects. The 
bill also creates a category of demonstration 
projects for sponsors that propose a signifi-
cant amount of local and/or private funding 
and reduce the federal commitment required 
for the projects. 
Establishes a new category for capital in-
vestment projects by authorizing core capac-
ity projects, which will undergo the same 
process as other ‘‘new starts’’ projects but 
provide an opportunity for existing systems 
to make necessary but significant invest-
ments that were not previously eligible for 
funding. The conference report requires that 
eligible activities under a core capacity 
project achieve at least a 10% increase in ca-
pacity along a corridor. 
The Senate agreed to a House request to 
modify the definition of Bus Rapid Transit 
projects in the Senate bill to allow broader 
use of the program. The conference report 
also includes incentives for the development 
of bus rapid transit projects that incorporate 
elements of fixed-guideway transit like light 
rail. 
Sec. 20009, 49 U.S.C. 5310, formula grants for the 
enhanced mobility of seniors and individ-
uals with disabilities 
Consolidates the existing ‘‘Elderly and Dis-
abled’’ (Sec. 5310) and ‘‘New Freedom’’ (Sec. 
5317) programs into a single program that in-
creases the level of resources available be-
yond the level of funding available under ex-
isting programs. The consolidated program 
will continue to ensure support for non-prof-
it providers of transportation, and it will 
continue to make available funds for public 
transportation services that exceed the re-
quirements of the Americans with Disabil-
ities Act, as previously provided under the 
‘‘New Freedom’’ program. 
Sec. 20010, 49 U.S.C. 5311, formula grants for 
rural areas 
Maintains the existing structure providing 
funding to states for public transportation in 
rural areas. The 5311 formula is expanded to 
include the rural component of the ‘‘Job Ac-
cess and Reverse Commute’’ program, and 
the level of public transportation service 
that is provided within a state’s rural areas 
is considered in the distribution of new 
funds. 
Funding for the ‘‘Public Transportation on 
Indian Reservations’’ program is increased 
to $30 million. The Secretary will distribute 
$5 million competitively each fiscal year, 
and $25 million will be available to Indian 
Tribes as formula grants to continue and ex-
pand public transportation services. 
The conference report also establishes a 
new 
‘‘Appalachian 
Development 
Public 
Transportation Program’’ to distribute $20 
million to states within the Appalachian re-
gion with a goal of providing greater public 
transportation opportunities to residents in 
these challenged areas. 
Sec. 20011, 49 U.S.C. 5312, research, develop-
ment, 
demonstration, 
and 
deployment 
projects 
Modifies the existing research program by 
eliminating earmarks and reforming the pro-
gram to provide research focused on public 
transportation with a goal of providing 
meaningful results. 
Creates a clearly delineated pipeline with 
criteria for continued progress with a goal of 
taking an idea from the research phase 
through to demonstration and deployment in 
the field. For the first time, the program 
specifically provides funding for demonstra-
tion and deployment of products and services 
that may benefit public transportation; a 
major impediment to putting new tech-
nology to use in the field often cited by pub-
lic transportation providers. 
Creates a section of the deployment pro-
gram dedicated to low or no emission public 
transportation vehicles. Grants will be avail-
able for the acquisition of low or no emission 
vehicles and related equipment, the con-
struction of facilities for low or no emission 
vehicles, and the rehabilitation of existing 
facilities to accommodate the use of low or 
no emission vehicles. 
Sec. 20012, 49 U.S.C. 5314, technical assistance 
and standards development 
Provides grants for activities that help 
public transportation systems more effec-
tively and efficiently provide public trans-
portation service and helps grant recipients 
administer funds received under this chap-
ter. Authorizes the Federal Transit Adminis-
tration to continue making grants for the 
development of voluntary standards by the 
public transportation industry related to 
procurement, safety and other subjects and 
authorizes the Secretary to fund technical 
assistance centers to assist grant recipients 
following a competitive process. 
Sec. 20014, 49 U.S.C. 5318, bus testing facilities 
Instructs the Secretary to certify one fa-
cility for testing new bus models. Requires 
the Secretary to work with the bus industry 
to develop a mutually agreed upon pass/fail 
test for vehicles to ensure the safety and re-
liability of buses purchased with federal 
funds. 
Sec. 20015, 49 U.S.C. 5322, public transportation 
workforce development and human resource 
programs 
Authorizes the Secretary to make grants, 
or enter into contracts for, activities that 
address human resource and workforce needs 
as they apply to public transportation ac-
tivities. 
Creates 
the 
Innovative 
Public 
Transportation Workforce Development Pro-
gram, a competitive grant program to pro-
mote and assist the development of innova-
tive workforce development and human re-
source activities within the public transpor-
tation industry. 
Sec. 20017, 49 U.S.C. 5324, public transportation 
emergency relief program 
Establishes a program to assist States and 
public transportation systems pay for pro-
tecting, repairing, or replacing equipment 
and facilities that are in danger of suffering 
serious damage or have suffered serious dam-
age as a result of an emergency. 
Sec. 20019, 49 U.S.C. 5326, transit asset manage-
ment 
Establishes a system to monitor and man-
age public transportation assets to improve 
safety and increase reliability and perform-
ance. Recipients are required to establish 
and use an asset management system to de-
velop capital asset inventories and condition 
assessments, and report on the condition of 
their system as a whole, including a descrip-
tion of the change in overall condition since 
the last report. The Secretary of Transpor-
tation is also required to define the term 
‘state of good repair,’ including objective 
standards for measuring the condition of 
capital assets.

June 28, 2012 
Sec. 20021, 49 U.S.C. 5329, public transportation 
safety program 
Establishes a National Public Transpor-
tation Safety Plan to improve the safety of 
all public transportation systems that re-
ceive Federal funding. The Secretary will de-
velop minimum performance standards for 
vehicles used in public transportation and 
establish a training program for Federal and 
State employees who conduct safety audits 
and examinations of public transportation 
systems. 
Requires public transportation agencies to 
establish comprehensive safety plans, thus 
encouraging a ‘‘culture of safety’’ in which 
each employee completes a safety training 
program that includes continuing safety edu-
cation and training. The Senate receded to a 
House request to give smaller systems the 
option to rely on states to prepare these 
plans. 
Improves the effectiveness of State Safety 
Oversight Agencies and increases federal 
funding for safety. States will submit pro-
posals for state safety oversight programs 
for rail fixed guideway public transportation 
systems to the Secretary, and upon approval, 
receive funding at an 80 percent Federal 
share. The Act builds on the existence of 
State safety oversight agencies and requires 
them to be legally and financially inde-
pendent from the rail fixed guideway sys-
tems they oversee, and have the authority, 
staff training and expertise to enforce Fed-
eral and state safety laws. 
At the request of the House the conference 
changes the nature of the enforcement pow-
ers contained in the Senate bill. Instead of 
direct oversight of public transportation 
agencies, the program relies on State Safety 
Oversight Agencies to provide direct over-
sight of rail fixed guideway public transpor-
tation providers. 
Sec. 20027, 49 U.S.C. 5337, state of good repair 
grant program 
Modernizes, renames, and provides historic 
levels of funding for the old ‘‘Rail Mod-
ernization’’ program by establishing a pro-
gram structure and defining eligible ex-
penses under the program with a goal of 
moving all systems towards a state of good 
repair and enabling systems to maintain a 
state of good repair. 
The program has two major components: a 
rail fixed guideway state of good repair for-
mula program and a high intensity bus state 
of good repair formula program. Funding 
tiers and earmarks in the old rail moderniza-
tion program have been eliminated and re-
placed with a new structure that focuses on 
the age of the system, revenue vehicle miles 
and directional route miles. 
DIVISION C—TRANSPORTATION SAFETY 
AND SURFACE TRANSPORTATION POL-
ICY 
TITLE I—MOTOR VEHICLE AND HIGHWAY 
SAFETY IMPROVEMENT ACT 
Highway Safety Grant Programs. The con-
ference report includes provisions that re-
structure the existing highway safety grant 
programs administered by the National 
Highway 
Traffic 
Safety 
Administration 
(NHTSA). The conference report largely re-
flects the Senate approach on modifications 
to the existing formula grant programs, in-
cluding the establishment of a single grant 
application and reporting process for all 
grants received under this title, the adoption 
of performance measures, and the establish-
ment of planning and reporting requirements 
for the states. In addition, the conference re-
port inserts a prohibition on state use of 
these formula grant funds to pay for red 
light or speed cameras. The report moves a 
provision establishing a cooperative research 
and evaluation program into a different sec-
nancial responsibility requirements for im-
porters and modifies a provision relating to 
conditions of importation. 
Transparency 
and 
Accountability. 
The 
conference report contains several provisions 
designed to increase transparency and ac-
countability at NHTSA and in the auto in-
dustry. The conference report adopts a modi-
fied Senate approach on establishing public 
accessibility to vehicle recall information 
and further modifies Senate provisions ad-
dressing the set of communications with 
dealers that must be made available to the 
public. The report strikes the provision re-
garding public availability of early warning 
reporting data. The report strikes a provi-
sion imposing new post-employment restric-
tions for vehicle safety officials at NHTSA, 
but retains language calling on the inspector 
general to report on the issue. The report 
slightly modifies the whistleblower protec-
tion provision and calls on the Government 
Accountability Office to examine this and 
other such provisions. The report slightly 
modifies the provision directing NHTSA to 
study crash data collection. And the report 
makes slight modifications to NHTSA’s au-
thority to require additional recall notifica-
tions. 
Vehicle Electronics and Safety Standards. 
The conference report maintains a Senate 
provision that establishes a Council for Vehi-
cle 
Electronics, 
Vehicle 
Software, 
and 
Emerging Technologies to build, implement, 
and aggregate NHTSA’s expertise in pas-
senger motor vehicle electronics and other 
new and emerging technologies. The con-
ference report includes a provision calling on 
NHTSA to evaluate vehicle electronic sys-
tems and report to Congress on highest pri-
ority areas for safety. The conference report 
strikes all other safety mandates contained 
in Subtitle D of the Senate bill. 
Child Safety Standards. The conference re-
port maintains the Senate approach with re-
gard to child safety. The report strikes man-
dates for new safety standards for booster 
seats and child restraint anchorage systems 
because conferees understand that NHTSA 
has completed a rulemaking that achieves 
these goals. The report modifies the mandate 
that NHTSA update its frontal impact test 
parameters for child safety seats to clarify 
that the mandate only applies to the seat as-
sembly specifications. The report revises the 
provision relating to unattended passengers 
to a discretionary research effort without 
any mandate for NHTSA to begin a rule-
making process. 
Improved Daytime and Nighttime Visi-
bility of Agricultural Equipment. The Con-
ference report accepts the Senate language. 
TITLE II—COMMERCIAL MOTOR VEHICLE 
SAFETY ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2012 
Commercial Motor Vehicle Registration 
requirements. The conference report in-
cludes several provisions amending registra-
tion requirements under federal law for com-
mercial motor vehicles (CMV), freight for-
warders, and brokers. The conference report 
largely adopts the Senate registration provi-
sions. The provisions include new require-
ments, such as completing a written exam-
ination and applying for a US DOT number, 
as a precondition for being registered. The 
included provisions amend safety fitness re-
quirements and require license holders to 
provide registration updates. The conference 
report also includes Senate provisions for 
registering household goods motor carriers, 
but removes provisions directing the Sec-
retary to establish education and assistance 
programs to address the problems of house-
hold property being held hostage. 
The conference report makes changes to 
some Senate registration provisions. It re-
tains the current presumption in favor of 
tion, but continues to fund it from the funds 
provided for the formula grant program. 
The conference report accepts the Senate 
approach on incentive grants, but consoli-
dates all of those grants into a single section 
in Code. The new Section 405 of Title 23, ‘‘Na-
tional Priority Safety Programs,’’ allocates 
funds across six incentive grant programs 
and allows such funds to be used for a re-
search program on technology to prevent im-
paired driving. The conference report retains 
the Senate language with respect to state 
traffic safety information system improve-
ment grants, the motorcycle safety grant 
program, and the high visibility enforcement 
program. 
The conference report retains the Senate 
language with respect to an occupant protec-
tion incentive grant with two modifications. 
First, the report provides the highest per-
forming states with additional flexibility in 
spending grant funds. Second, the report 
does not specifically state that education to 
the public concerning the dangers of children 
left unattended in vehicles is an allowable 
use of these funds, however the conferees 
agree that such education efforts could be 
carried out under other allowable uses, in-
cluding education to the public concerning 
the proper use of child restraints. 
The conference report reflects the Senate 
approach with regard to the impaired driving 
countermeasures and teen driver safety 
grants with one modification made to each 
that allows states additional flexibility in 
spending a percentage of funds received 
through these programs. The report also ac-
cepts the Senate approach on distracted 
driving incentive grants, with one change to 
the eligibility requirements for the grants. 
Highway Safety Research. The conference 
report accepts the Senate approach to modi-
fying the highway safety research authori-
ties provided to NHTSA. The report strikes 
provisions in the Senate bill that authorized 
additional collaborative research and devel-
opment with non-federal entities, allowed 
the Secretary to establish an international 
highway safety information and cooperation 
program, funded training for highway safety 
personnel, and created a clearinghouse for 
information about best practices for driver’s 
licensing concerning drivers with medical 
issues. The report removes language in the 
Senate bill that allowed NHTSA to develop 
model specifications for devices. The con-
ferees understand the removal of this lan-
guage does not alter the current authority of 
NHTSA in this area. 
The conference report modifies Senate lan-
guage providing NHTSA with the authority 
to conduct research into advanced tech-
nology to prevent impaired driving, and al-
lows the Secretary to use funds from the Na-
tional Priority Safety Programs to fund this 
research. 
Enhanced Safety Authorities. The con-
ference report includes several provisions in-
tended to enhance NHTSA’s safety authori-
ties. The conference report revises the Sen-
ate language on civil penalties and sets the 
maximum penalty at $35 million for a re-
lated series of violations. The increase will 
take effect one year after enactment or when 
NHTSA issues a rule interpreting the new 
civil penalty factors, whichever is earlier, 
and the conferees agree that the new penalty 
amount will only be subject to adjustment 
for inflation occurring thereafter. The con-
ference report maintains the Senate ap-
proach on motor vehicle safety research and 
development with modification, including to 
NHTSA’s authority to plan, design, or build 
facilities. The conference report largely 
maintains the Senate approach providing 
NHTSA additional authority over imported 
motor vehicles and motor vehicle equipment, 
though it strikes a provision related to fi-

registration, removes a management plan re-
quirement, and changes written examination 
provisions. For providers of motorcoach 
services, the conference report also replaces 
a pre-authorization audit requirement with a 
requirement that new operators undergo a 
safety review within 120 days of beginning 
operations. The conference report also re-
moves requirements to periodically update 
registration information when no changes 
have been made. 
The conference report includes a number of 
Senate provisions to address motor carrier 
companies that mask prior noncompliance 
and adverse safety history. The provisions 
authorize the Secretary to withhold, sus-
pend, amend, or revoke a motor carrier’s reg-
istration if the carrier failed to disclose an 
adverse safety history or other facts relevant 
to its past regulatory compliance. The provi-
sions authorize similar action where the Sec-
retary finds that within the previous 3 years 
the carrier: (1) was closely related to another 
motor carrier with a poor compliance his-
tory; and (2) did not disclose this relation-
ship in its application. The Secretary is 
granted authority to refuse or revoke a 
USDOT number to an applicant that is unfit, 
unwilling or unable to comply with the safe-
ty 
regulations. 
The 
conference 
report 
amends some of the Senate provisions to 
limit the unintended results of punishing in-
dividuals who were not guilty parties in pre-
vious companies. 
The conference report adopts several Sen-
ate penalty provisions for operations in vio-
lation of registration requirements. The con-
ference report includes civil penalties and 
revocation authority for operating without 
registration, operating as imminent hazard, 
and transporting hazardous wastes without 
necessary registration. Provisions increase 
the civil penalties for motor carriers, motor 
carriers of migrant workers and private 
motor carriers that disobey a subpoena or a 
requirement of the Secretary to produce wit-
nesses or records. Other provisions included 
authorize the Secretary to suspend, amend 
or revoke the registration of a motor carrier, 
broker or freight forwarder for failing to 
obey an administrative subpoena. Another 
provision authorizes the Secretary to place 
out of service the operations of a motor car-
rier discovered to be operating vehicles with-
out the required registration, or operating 
beyond the scope of the registration granted. 
The conference report amends the Senate 
provision for hazardous waste transportation 
penalties and sets the penalty range at not 
less than $20,000 but not to exceed $40,000. 
Electronic logging devices. The conference 
report includes provisions directing the Sec-
retary to issue regulations requiring elec-
tronic logging devices for recording hours of 
service in commercial motor vehicles and 
sets basic performance standards for the de-
vice. The conference report adopted the Sen-
ate approach with some amendments. The 
conference report adds an hours of service 
field study to expand on a previous Federal 
Motor 
Carrier 
Safety 
Administration 
(FMCSA) report on driver fatigue and max-
imum driving time requirements focusing on 
the 34-hour restart rule. The conference re-
port directs the Secretary, in prescribing 
regulations, to consider how the rule may re-
duce or eliminate requirements for drivers 
and motor carriers to retain supporting doc-
umentation 
associated 
with 
paper-based 
records. The conference report changes the 
name of the device and adds other language 
to make clear that the devices are to be used 
only to enforce federal regulations. The re-
port also includes a definition of ‘‘tamper re-
sistant’’ and provisions to ensure that appro-
priate measures are taken to protect the pri-
vacy of individuals and the confidentiality of 
the data. 
Commercial motor vehicle driver safety. 
The conference report includes several Sen-
ate provisions to address commercial driver 
safety: driver medical qualifications, oper-
ator training, driver’s license program, driv-
er’s requirements and driver information 
systems. The conference report removes a 
Senate provision that would have directed 
the development of driver safety fitness rat-
ings. The report also removes a study and re-
port to Congress examining the extent to 
which detention time contributes to drivers 
violating hours of service requirements and 
driver fatigue. The conference report re-
moves a Senate provision that would have 
amended the membership of the Motor Car-
rier Safety Advisory Committee to specifi-
cally include non-profit employee organiza-
tion representation. 
The provisions included direct the Sec-
retary to establish a national registry of 
medical examiners, issue regulations to es-
tablish minimum entry-level training re-
quirements for all CMV operators, require 
States to modernize commercial driver’s li-
cense (CDL) information systems, and add 
disqualification standards for drivers. The 
conference report includes Senate provisions 
for the commercial driver’s license program, 
but removes language for federal guidance 
on critical requirements for effective State 
CDL programs. The conference report in-
cludes alternate language directing states to 
prioritize areas that the Secretary has iden-
tified as critical in the most recent audit of 
their programs. 
The conference report also includes lan-
guage for streamlining the process by which 
military members and veterans who operate 
heavy trucks during duty are able to obtain 
commercial driver’s licenses. The conference 
provision includes Senate language directing 
the Secretary to complete a study and report 
to Congress on what can be done to stream-
line the process. The report adds new lan-
guage requiring the Secretary, based on rec-
ommendations of the report, to establish ac-
celerated licensing procedures within 1 year 
of enactment. 
Drug and Alcohol Clearinghouse. The con-
ference report includes Senate provisions di-
recting the Secretary to establish a national 
repository for records relating to alcohol and 
controlled substances testing of CMV driv-
ers. The records will be used to determine 
the qualifications for operating a CMV. The 
clearinghouse will include safeguards to pro-
tect the privacy of individuals to whom the 
information pertains and ensure that the in-
formation is not divulged to anyone not di-
rectly involved in evaluating the individual’s 
qualifications to drive a CMV. The con-
ference report also includes Senate provi-
sions for prohibiting an employer from hir-
ing a driver unless he or she has determined 
that during the preceding three years that 
such driver: did not test positive in violation 
of the regulations at title 49, Code of Federal 
Regulations; and did not refuse a test under 
these regulations. Other included provisions 
grant preemption authority to the Secretary 
in regard to the reporting of valid positive 
results or refusals to take alcohol screening 
and drug tests, and apply civil penalties to 
any violators of privacy and reporting re-
quirements. 
The conference report amends Senate pro-
visions for archiving personal records to en-
sure further individual privacy protections. 
The conference report also includes amend-
ments to the National Transportation Safety 
Board’s access to clearinghouse records. The 
conference report makes amendments to 
clarify that the clearinghouse will be used to 
determine whether individuals have existing 
employment prohibitions at the time of 
making hiring decisions. 
Motor Carrier Grant programs. The con-
ference report does not include Senate provi-
sions updating and consolidating grant pro-
grams and processes. While the conference 
believes that reducing administrative bur-
dens on the states and local governments by 
streamlining grants processes is beneficial, 
the short time frame of the legislation does 
not allow for these changes. In that regard, 
the conference agrees to retain existing 
grant programs and authorizes them for FY 
2013 and FY 2014 at current funding levels. 
The conference report adds language allow-
ing the Secretary to examine methods and 
approaches for streamlining grants adminis-
tration and processes to reduce burdens for 
the states and local governments. The con-
ference report makes some administrative 
amendments to the existing commercial 
driver license program improvement grant 
that was included in the Senate bill. The 
conference also retains the Senate provision 
requiring a report to Congress on resuming 
the commercial vehicle information systems 
and networks program. 
Motorcoach Safety. The conference report 
includes provisions addressing the safety of 
motorcoach 
operations. 
The 
conference 
adopts the Senate approach, but modifies 
some rulemaking and research requirements 
and removes registration provisions. The 
conference report consolidates several re-
search and rulemakings related to fire pre-
vention and mitigation. The report amends 
language on assessing the feasibility of ret-
rofitting existing motorcoaches with safety 
requirements. The report makes conforming 
definition changes regarding the registration 
of motorcoaches. The registration provisions 
were not included in the conference report 
because they are largely redundant to the 
provisions in the report updating registra-
tion requirements for all motor carriers. 
The conference report also includes a Sen-
ate provision for oversight of motorcoaches. 
The provision directs the Secretary to estab-
lish a safety fitness system to rate motor 
coaches, determine and assign a fitness rat-
ing for each motor coach, periodically review 
the safety ratings and make public the fit-
ness ratings of each motorcoach. 
The conference report includes a new pro-
vision that directs the Secretary, to the ex-
tent feasible, to ensure that motorcoach re-
search programs and rulemaking are carried 
out concurrently. The report also includes a 
provision requiring the Secretary to review 
and report to Congress on the current knowl-
edge and skill testing requirements for a 
commercial driver’s license passenger en-
dorsement. The conference agreement re-
moves a Senate rulemaking requirement on 
distracted driving because FMCSA has al-
ready addressed this issue. 
Truck, Size and Weight. The conference re-
port includes provisions directing the Sec-
retary to study the effects of truck, size and 
weight on highway safety and infrastructure 
and compile a list of existing state truck size 
and weight laws. The conference report 
amends the Senate study provisions. The 
conference report includes language direct-
ing the Secretary to consider the effects of 
trucks operating in excess of federal law and 
regulations in comparison to those trucks 
that do not operate in excess of federal law 
and regulations, when assessing accident fre-
quency and impacts to highway and bridge 
infrastructure. The conference report adopts 
the Senate requirement that the report must 
be submitted to Congress not later than 2 
years after enactment. 
Financial responsibility requirements. The 
conference report includes provisions ad-
dressing 
the 
financial 
responsibility 
of 
freight-forwarders and brokers. These provi-
sions direct rulemakings to establish min-
imum financial solvency and bonding re-
quirements for these entities. The con-
ference agreement includes exemptions for

equivalent to the Federal permit, and ac-
tions to improve the program including an 
additional level of fitness review. Based on 
the findings of the review, the Secretary 
may either issue a rulemaking to make any 
necessary improvements to the program, or 
publish in the Federal Register justification 
for why a rulemaking is not necessary. 
Civil penalties. The conference report adds 
new language amending civil penalties by re-
moving the minimum penalty amount for 
violations of hazardous materials laws and 
regulations. The conference report also adds 
language amending penalties for training 
violations. It includes a definition of ‘‘ob-
struct’’ regarding penalties for obstruction 
of inspections and investigations. 
TITLE V—NATIONAL RAIL SYSTEM PRESERVA-
TION, EXPANSION AND DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 
2012 
The Senate legislation included provisions 
that would direct the Secretary, in collabo-
ration with stakeholders, to develop a long- 
range, national rail plan. Other provisions in 
this title would amend statutory require-
ments for implementation of positive train 
control, refine Surface Transportation Board 
authorities and amend and update Amtrak’s 
environmental review, capital planning and 
financing, and inspector general authorities. 
The conference report does not include any 
of the provisions in this title. 
TITLE VI—SPORT FISH RESTORATION AND 
RECREATIONAL BOATING SAFETY ACT OF 2012 
Sport Fish Restoration and Boating Trust 
Fund. The conference report adopts Senate 
provisions to authorize appropriations and 
amounts for administrative costs through 
FY 2013 for the Sport Fish Restoration and 
Boating Trust Fund. The Trust Fund, often 
referred to as Wallop-Breaux, is the main-
stay of funding for State and Federal sport 
fish conservation and recreational boating 
safety programs. Funds go to projects that 
support sport fish conservation and habitat 
conservation in the States, and to assist 
States in establishing and maintaining rec-
reational boating safety and boater edu-
cation programs. The Trust Fund receives 
income from the following five sources: (1) 
motorboat fuel taxes; (2) annual tax receipts 
from small engine fuel used for outdoor 
power equipment; (3) a manufacturers’ excise 
tax on sport fishing equipment; (4) import 
duties on fishing tackle and on yachts and 
pleasure craft; and (5) interest on funds in-
vested prior to disbursal. All moneys re-
ceived in a given fiscal year are apportioned 
to the States in the following fiscal year. 
TITLE VII—MISCELLANEOUS 
the feasibility and effectiveness of using 
paperless hazard communications systems. 
The conference report includes these provi-
sions and adds a requirement to conduct a 
cost-benefit analysis of the pilot projects and 
submit recommendations on the analysis and 
other findings in the report to Congress. 
The conference report includes Senate pro-
visions requiring an assessment of the Pipe-
line and Hazardous Materials Safety Admin-
istration’s (PHMSA) hazmat data collection, 
analysis and reporting. These provisions re-
quire PHMSA to develop an action plan and 
timeline to make improvements to its sys-
tems. The conference report directs PHMSA 
to conduct the assessment in consultation 
with Commandant of the Coast Guard, in 
lieu of in coordination with the Secretary of 
Homeland Security. This amendment was in-
cluded because the Coast Guard is more spe-
cifically involved in handling accidents and 
investigations in the transportation of haz-
ardous materials. 
Hazmat Transportation. The conference re-
port includes a new requirement for the Sec-
retary to study the safety of transporting 
flammable liquids in the external pipes of 
cargo tanks, ‘‘wetlines.’’ The report specifies 
that the Secretary may not issue a rule-
making on ‘‘wetlines’’ until the study is 
complete, but no later than two years after 
the date of enactment. The conference report 
also modifies Senate provisions that direct 
the Secretary to address transportation of 
perishable material after inspection, train-
ing for inspectors and the proper closing of 
packaging after inspections, by requiring 
that these regulations be issued within a 
year after enactment. 
The Senate bill included a provision that 
requires uniform regulations for the safe 
loading and unloading of hazardous mate-
rials on and off tank cars and cargo tank 
trucks. The provision was not included in 
the conference report due to an ongoing rule-
making addressing the matter. 
The conference report includes a Senate 
provision that ensures States update the 
hazardous materials route registry kept by 
the Department of Transportation. 
Special permitting. The conference report 
amends provisions included in the Senate 
bill on special permits. The conference re-
port removes some language regarding cri-
teria for special permits but includes the 
rulemaking provision for special permit and 
approvals procedures. It directs a review and 
analysis of special permits that have been in 
continuous effect for a 10-year period to de-
termine which permits can be converted into 
the hazardous materials regulations (HMR). 
It includes factors that the Secretary may 
consider in reviewing special permits. After 
the analysis is complete, but no later than 3 
years after enactment, the report authorizes 
the Secretary to issue regulations for incor-
porating special permits into the HMR. The 
amended language also directs the Secretary 
to publish in the Federal Register justifica-
tion in the case of special permits that are 
not appropriate for incorporation into the 
HMR. Similarly, the amended language in-
cludes a process to review a special permit 
for incorporation into the regulations once 
that permit has been in effect for 10 years. 
Motor carrier safety permits. The con-
ference report includes a provision directing 
the Secretary to conduct a review of the im-
plementation of the hazardous material safe-
ty permit program. The conference report di-
rects the Secretary to consider factors, in-
cluding the list of hazardous materials re-
quiring a safety permit, the criteria used by 
PHMSA to determine whether a hazardous 
material safety permit issued by a State is 
air carrier and customs brokers who are al-
ready subject to financial responsibility re-
quirements under federal law. 
Enforcement. The Senate bill included sev-
eral 
provisions 
amending 
and 
updating 
FMCSA’s enforcement authorities. The con-
ference report includes nine of the Senate 
provisions. Five of the Senate enforcement 
provisions were not included in the con-
ference report: minimum prohibition on op-
eration of unfit carriers, minimum out of 
service penalties, failure to pay civil penalty 
as a disqualifying offense, intrastate oper-
ations of interstate motor carriers and en-
forcement of safety laws and regulations. 
Exemptions. The conference report amends 
an exemption for the transportation of agri-
cultural commodities by increasing the per-
mitted travel radius from 100 air-miles to 150 
air-miles. The conference report includes 
Senate language for a narrow exemption 
from federal requirements for covered farm 
vehicles. This conference report adopts the 
Senate language directing the Secretary to 
study and report to Congress on the safety 
impacts of the covered farm vehicle exemp-
tion. 
TITLE III—SURFACE TRANSPORTATION AND 
FREIGHT POLICY ACT OF 2012 
The Senate legislation included provisions 
establishing a comprehensive national sur-
face 
transportation 
system 
and 
freight 
transportation policy. The policy would have 
provided certainty to states and localities by 
requiring the development of long term, 
strategic plans and directing transportation 
investment data collection and evaluation 
efforts. This Senate title had included provi-
sions for safety standards to ensure that the 
design of federal transportation projects pro-
vides for adequate consideration of non-mo-
torized users. The conference report does not 
include this title. 
TITLE IV—HAZARDOUS MATERIALS TRANSPOR-
TATION SAFETY IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2012 
Training Programs. There is currently no 
uniform training standard for hazardous ma-
terials (‘‘hazmat’’) inspectors and investiga-
tors. The conference bill requires the Sec-
retary to establish standards for training 
these inspectors and investigators. The con-
ference report modifies the Senate bill to re-
quire that the standards be developed not 
later than 18 months after enactment, and to 
clarify that the standards are established as 
guidelines. 
The conference report includes Senate pro-
visions that amend training requirements for 
emergency responders of hazardous mate-
rials. These provisions direct that organiza-
tions receiving grant funding to train emer-
gency responders have the ability to protect 
against accidents or incidents involving the 
transportation of hazardous material in ac-
cordance 
with 
existing 
regulations 
and 
standards. 
The conference report adds language to 
permit ‘‘portable training’’ which can be of-
fered in any suitable setting rather than spe-
cific, designated facilities. This provision is 
included to allow training at locations and 
times convenient to students and instruc-
tors. The conference report also adds re-
quirements to ensure that the emergency re-
sponder 
and 
hazmat 
employee 
training 
grants be awarded through a competitive 
process. 
Data Collection and Research. The Senate 
bill recognized the need for increased re-
search and data collection on hazardous ma-
terials programs and included a new pilot 
program for paperless hazard communica-
tions. The program would permit the Sec-
retary to conduct pilot projects to evaluate 
Overflights in Grand Canyon National 
Park. The conference report makes amend-
ments to a Senate provision on aircraft noise 
abatement at Grand Canyon National Park 
(GCNP). The provision establishes standards 
to be used by the National Park Service 
(NPS) in restoring natural quiet at GCNP, 
defines the term ‘‘substantial restoration of 
natural quiet’’ for the park, and directs the 
NPS to take measures that promote adop-
tion of quiet technology aircraft at GCNP. 
Commercial air tour operations. The con-
ference report amends a Senate provision for 
commercial air tour operations at national 
parks. The report modifies existing statu-
tory authority to clarify the conditions 
under which the Director of the NPS may 
deny an application to begin or expand com-
mercial air tour operations without devel-
oping an air tour management plan at Crater 
Lake National Park and Great Smoky Moun-
tains National Park only.

PRESENT LAW HIGHWAY TRUST FUND EXCISE 
TAXES 
In general 
Six separate excise taxes are imposed to fi-
nance the Federal Highway Trust Fund pro-
gram. Three of these taxes are imposed on 
highway motor fuels. The remaining three 
are a retail sales tax on heavy highway vehi-
cles, a manufacturers’ excise tax on heavy 
vehicle tires, and an annual use tax on heavy 
vehicles. A substantial majority of the reve-
nues produced by the Highway Trust Fund 
excise taxes are derived from the taxes on 
motor fuels. The annual use tax on heavy ve-
hicles expires October 1, 2013. Except for 4.3 
cents per gallon of the Highway Trust Fund 
fuels tax rates, the remaining taxes are 
scheduled to expire after June 30, 2012. The 
4.3-cents-per-gallon portion of the fuels tax 
rates is permanent.2 The six taxes are sum-
marized below. 
Highway motor fuels taxes 
The Highway Trust Fund motor fuels tax 
rates are as follows: 3 
Gasoline .........................
18.3 cents per gallon 
Diesel fuel and kerosene 
24.3 cents per gallon 
Alternative fuels ............
18.3 or 24.3 cents per gallon generally 4 
4 See secs. 4041(a)(2), 4041(a)(3), and 4041(m). 
The provision extends the motor fuel 
taxes, and all three non-fuel excise taxes at 
their current rates through September 30, 
2015.14 The provision resolves the projected 
deficit in the Highway Trust Fund, assures a 
cushion of $2.8 billion in each account of the 
Highway Trust Fund, and creates a solvency 
account available for use by either highways 
or mass transit. Specifically, the Secretary 
of the Treasury is to transfer the excess of 
(1) any amount appropriated to the Highway 
Trust Fund before October 1, 2013, by reason 
of the provisions of this bill, over (2) the 
amount necessary to meet the required ex-
penditures from the Highway Trust Fund as 
authorized in section 9503(c) of the Code 
(which provides expenditure authority from 
the Highway Trust Fund) for the period end-
ing before October 1, 2013. Amounts in the 
solvency account are available for transfers 
to the Highway Account and the Mass Tran-
sit Account in such amounts as determined 
necessary by the Secretary to ensure that 
each account has a surplus balance of $2.8 
billion on September 30, 2013. The solvency 
account terminates on September 30, 2013 
and any remainder in the solvency account 
remains in the Highway Trust Fund. The 
Committee expects that the Secretary of the 
Treasury will consult with the Secretary of 
Transportation in making determinations 
concerning amounts necessary to meet re-
quired expenditures and amounts necessary 
to ensure the cushion of $2.8 billion. 
Effective date.—The provision is effective 
on April 1, 2012. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT 
PRESENT LAW HIGHWAY TRUST FUND 
EXPENDITURE PROVISIONS 
In general 
Under present law, revenues from the high-
way excise taxes, as imposed through June 
30, 2012, generally are dedicated to the High-
way Trust Fund. Dedication of excise tax 
revenues to the Highway Trust Fund and ex-
penditures from the Highway Trust Fund are 
governed by the Code.9 The Code authorizes 
expenditures 
(subject 
to 
appropriations) 
from the Highway Trust Fund through June 
30, 2012, for the purposes provided in author-
izing legislation, as such legislation was in 
effect on the date of enactment of the Sur-
face Transportation Extension Act of 2012. 
Highway Trust Fund expenditure purposes 
The Highway Trust Fund has a separate 
account for mass transit, the Mass Transit 
Account.10 The Highway Trust Fund and the 
Mass Transit Account are funding sources 
for specific programs. 
Highway Trust Fund expenditure purposes 
have been revised with each authorization 
Act enacted since establishment of the High-
way Trust Fund in 1956. In general, expendi-
tures authorized under those Acts (as the 
Acts were in effect on the date of enactment 
of the most recent such authorizing Act) are 
specified by the Code as Highway Trust Fund 
expenditure purposes.11 The Code provides 
that the authority to make expenditures 
from the Highway Trust Fund expires after 
June 30, 2012. Thus, no Highway Trust Fund 
expenditures may occur after June 30, 2012, 
without an amendment to the Code. 
As noted above, section 9503 appropriates 
to the Highway Trust Fund amounts equiva-
lent to the taxes received from the following: 
the taxes on diesel, gasoline, kerosene and 
special motor fuel, the tax on tires, the an-
nual heavy vehicle use tax, and the tax on 
the retail sale of heavy trucks and trailers.12 
Section 9601 provides that amounts appro-
priated to a trust fund pursuant to sections 
9501 through 9511, are to be transferred at 
least monthly from the General Fund of the 
Treasury to such trust fund on the basis of 
estimates made by the Secretary of the 
Treasury of the amounts referred to in the 
Code section appropriating the amounts to 
such trust fund. The Code requires that prop-
er adjustments be made in amounts subse-
quently transferred to the extent prior esti-
mates were in excess of, or less than, the 
amounts required to be transferred. 
HOUSE BILL 
Present-law 
expenditure 
authority 
and 
taxes are extended for an additional three 
months, through September 30, 2012. 
The conference agreement provides for ex-
penditure authority through September 30, 
2014. The Code provisions governing the pur-
poses for which monies in the Highway Trust 
Fund may be spent are updated to include 
the conference agreement bill, MAP–21. 
Cross-references to the reauthorization bill 
in the Code provisions governing the Sport 
Fish Restoration and Boating Trust Fund 
are also updated to include the conference 
agreement bill. In general, the provision ex-
tends the taxes dedicated to the Highway 
Trust Fund at their present law rates 
through September 30, 2016, and for the 
heavy vehicle use tax, through September 30, 
2017.15 
Non-fuel highway trust fund excise taxes 
In addition to the highway motor fuels ex-
cise tax revenues, the Highway Trust Fund 
receives revenues produced by three excise 
taxes imposed exclusively on heavy highway 
vehicles or tires. These taxes are: 
1. A 12-percent excise tax imposed on the 
first retail sale of heavy highway vehicles, 
tractors, and trailers (generally, trucks hav-
ing a gross vehicle weight in excess of 33,000 
pounds and trailers having such a weight in 
excess of 26,000 pounds); 5 
2. An excise tax imposed on highway tires 
with a rated load capacity exceeding 3,500 
pounds, generally at a rate of 0.945 cents per 
10 pounds of excess; 6 and 
3. An annual use tax imposed on highway 
vehicles having a taxable gross weight of 
55,000 pounds or more.7 (The maximum rate 
for this tax is $550 per year, imposed on vehi-
cles having a taxable gross weight over 75,000 
pounds.) 
The taxable year for the annual use tax is 
from July 1st through June 30th of the fol-
lowing year. For the period July 1, 2013, 
through September 30, 2013, the amount of 
the annual use tax is reduced by 75 percent.8 
Effective date.—The provision is effective 
July 1, 2012. 
13 The provision also replaces cross-references to 
the Surface Transportation Extension Act of 2011, 
Part II, with MAP–21, and replaces April 1, 2012 ref-
erences with October 1, 2013 in the Code provisions 
governing the Leaking Underground Storage Tank 
Trust Fund, and the Sport Fish Restoration and 
Boating Trust Fund. 
14 The Leaking Underground Storage Tank Trust 
Fund financing rate of 0.1 cent per gallon also is ex-
tended through September 30, 2015. 
15 The Leaking Underground Storage Tank Trust 
Fund financing rate also is extended through Sep-
tember 30, 2016. The provision also corrects a poten-
tial drafting ambiguity regarding the taxable period 
as reflected in prior legislation. The provision is ef-
fective as if included in section 142 of the Surface 
Transportation Extension Act of 2011, Part II. 
1 Except where otherwise stated, all section ref-
erences are to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as 
amended (the ‘‘Code’’). 
2 This portion of the tax rates was enacted as a def-
icit reduction measure in 1993. Receipts from it were 
retained in the General Fund until 1997 legislation 
provided for their transfer to the Highway Trust 
Fund. 
3 Secs. 4081(a)(2)(A)(i), 4081(a)(2)(A)(iii), 4041(a)(2), 
4041(a)(3), and 4041(m). Some of these fuels also are 
subject to an additional 0.1-cent-per-gallon excise 
tax to fund the Leaking Underground Storage Tank 
Trust Fund (secs. 4041(d) and 4081(a)(2)(B)). 
5 Sec. 4051. 
6 Sec. 4071. 
7 Sec. 4481. 
8 Sec. 4482(c)(4) and (d). 
9 Sec. 9503. The Highway Trust Fund statutory pro-
visions were placed in the Internal Revenue Code in 
1982. 
10 Sec. 9503(e)(1). 
11 The authorizing Acts that currently are ref-
erenced in the Highway Trust Fund provisions of the 
Code are: the Highway Revenue Act of 1956; Titles I 
and II of the Surface Transportation Assistance Act 
of 1982; the Surface Transportation and Uniform Re-
location Act of 1987; the Intermodal Surface Trans-
portation Efficiency Act of 1991; the Transportation 
Equity Act for the 21st Century, the Surface Trans-
portation Extension Act of 2003, the Surface Trans-
portation Extension Act of 2004; the Surface Trans-

1974 (‘‘ERISA’’), which is generally in the ju-
risdiction of the Department of Labor.21 The 
minimum funding rules for single-employer 
defined benefit plans were substantially re-
vised by the Pension Protection Act of 2006 
(‘‘PPA’’).22 
Minimum required contributions 
In general 
The minimum required contribution for a 
plan year for a single-employer defined ben-
efit plan generally depends on a comparison 
of the value of the plan’s assets, reduced by 
any prefunding balance or funding standard 
carryover balance (‘‘net value of plan as-
sets’’),23 with the plan’s funding target and 
target normal cost. The plan’s funding tar-
get for a plan year is the present value of all 
benefits accrued or earned as of the begin-
ning of the plan year. A plan’s target normal 
cost for a plan year is generally the present 
value of benefits expected to accrue or to be 
earned during the plan year. 
If the net value of plan assets is less than 
the plan’s funding target, so that the plan 
has a funding shortfall (discussed further 
below), the minimum required contribution 
is the sum of the plan’s target normal cost 
and the shortfall amortization charge for the 
plan year (determined as described below).24 
If the net value of plan assets is equal to or 
exceeds the plan’s funding target, the min-
imum required contribution is the plan’s tar-
get normal cost, reduced by the amount, if 
any, by which the net value of plan assets 
exceeds the plan’s funding target. 
Shortfall amortization charge 
The shortfall amortization charge for a 
plan year is the sum of the annual shortfall 
amortization installments attributable to 
the shortfall bases for that plan year and the 
six previous plan years. Generally, if a plan 
has a funding shortfall for the plan year, a 
shortfall amortization base must be estab-
lished for the plan year.25 A plan’s funding 
shortfall is the amount by which the plan’s 
funding target exceeds the net value of plan 
assets. The shortfall amortization base for a 
plan year is: (1) the plan’s funding shortfall, 
minus (2) the present value, determined 
using the segment interest rates (discussed 
below), of the aggregate total of the shortfall 
amortization installments that have been de-
termined for the plan year and any suc-
ceeding plan year with respect to any short-
fall amortization bases for the six previous 
plan years. The shortfall amortization base 
is amortized in level annual installments 
(‘‘shortfall amortization installments’’) over 
a seven-year period beginning with the cur-
rent plan year and using the segment inter-
est rates (discussed below).26 
The shortfall amortization base for a plan 
year may be positive or negative, depending 
on whether the present value of remaining 
installments with respect to amortization 
bases for previous years is more or less than 
the plan’s funding shortfall. If the shortfall 
amortization base is positive (that is, the 
funding shortfall exceeds the present value 
of the remaining installments), the related 
shortfall amortization installments are posi-
tive. If the shortfall amortization base is 
negative, the related shortfall amortization 
installments are negative. The positive and 
negative shortfall amortization installments 
for a particular plan year are netted when 
adding them up in determining the shortfall 
PRESENT LAW 
Leaking Underground Storage Tank Trust Fund 
financing rate 
Fuels of a type subject to other trust fund 
excise taxes generally are subject to an add- 
on excise tax of 0.1-cent-per-gallon to fund 
the Leaking Underground Storage Tank 
(‘‘LUST’’) Trust Fund.16 For example, the 
LUST excise tax applies to gasoline, diesel 
fuel, kerosene, and most alternative fuels 
subject to highway and aviation fuels excise 
taxes, and to fuels subject to the inland wa-
terways fuel excise tax. This excise tax is 
imposed on both uses and parties subject to 
the other taxes, and to situations (other 
than export) in which the fuel otherwise is 
tax-exempt. For example, off-highway busi-
ness use of gasoline and off-highway use of 
diesel fuel and kerosene generally are ex-
empt from highway motor fuels excise tax. 
Similarly, States and local governments and 
certain other parties are exempt from such 
tax. Nonetheless, all such uses and parties 
are subject to the 0.1-cent-per-gallon LUST 
excise tax. 
Liquefied natural gas, compressed natural 
gas, and liquefied petroleum gas are exempt 
from the LUST tax. Additionally, methanol 
and ethanol fuels produced from coal (includ-
ing peat) are taxed at a reduced rate of 0.05 
cents per gallon. 
The LUST tax is scheduled to expire after 
June 30, 2012.17 
Overview of Leaking Underground Storage 
Tank Trust Fund expenditure provisions 
Amounts in the LUST Trust Fund are 
available, as provided in appropriations Acts, 
for purposes of making expenditures to carry 
out sections 9003(h)–(j), 9004(f), 9005(c), and 
9010–9013 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act as 
in effect on the date of enactment of Public 
Law 109–168. Any claim filed against the 
LUST Trust Fund may be paid only out of 
such fund, and the liability of the United 
States for claims is limited to the amount in 
the fund. 
The monies in the LUST Trust Fund are 
used to pay expenses incurred by the Envi-
ronmental Protection Agency (the ‘‘EPA’’) 
and the States for preventing, detecting, and 
cleaning up leaks from petroleum under-
ground storage tanks, as well as programs to 
evaluate the compatibility of fuel storage 
tanks with alternative fuels, MTBE addi-
tives, and ethanol and biodiesel blends. 
The EPA makes grants to States to imple-
ment the program, and States use cleanup 
funds primarily to oversee and enforce cor-
rective actions by responsible parties. States 
and EPA also use cleanup funds to conduct 
corrective actions where no responsible 
party has been identified, where a respon-
sible party fails to comply with a cleanup 
order, in the event of an emergency, and to 
take cost recovery actions against parties. 
In 2005, Congress authorized the EPA and 
States to use trust fund monies for non- 
cleanup purposes as well, specifically for ad-
ministration and enforcement of the leak 
prevention requirements of the UST pro-
gram.18 
HOUSE BILL 
No provision. 
16 Secs. 4041, 4042, and 4081. 
17 For Federal budget scorekeeping purposes, the 
LUST Trust Fund tax, like other excise taxes dedi-
cated to trust funds, is assumed to be permanent. 
18 Pub. L. No. 109–58. 
19 As noted above, the Leaking Underground Stor-
age Tank Trust Fund financing rate of 0.1 cent per 
gallon is also extended through September 30, 2015. 
20 Sec. 412. A number of exceptions to the min-
imum funding rules apply. For example, govern-
mental plans (within the meaning of section 414(d) 
and church plans (within the meaning of section 
414(e)) are generally not subject to the minimum 
funding rules. Under section 4971, an excise tax ap-
plies to an employer maintaining a single-employer 
plan if the minimum funding requirements are not 
satisfied. 
21 Sec. 302 of ERISA. 
22 Pub. L. No. 109–280. The PPA minimum funding 
rules for single-employer plans are generally effec-
tive for plan years beginning after December 31, 2007. 
Delayed effective dates apply to single-employer 
plans sponsored by certain large defense contrac-
tors, multiple-employer plans of some rural coopera-
tives, eligible charity plans, and single-employer 
plans affected by settlement agreements with the 
Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. Subsequent 
changes to the single-employer plan and multiem-
ployer plan funding rules (including temporary fund-
ing relief) were made by the Worker, Retiree, and 
Employer Recovery Act of 2008 (‘‘WRERA’’), Pub. L. 
No. 110–458, and the Preservation of Access to Care 
for Medicare Beneficiaries and Pension Relief Act of 
2010 (‘‘PRA 2010’’), Public Law 111–192. 
23 The value of plan assets is generally reduced by 
any prefunding balance or funding standard carry-
over balance in determining minimum required con-
tributions, including for this purpose. A prefunding 
balance results from contributions to a plan that ex-
ceed the minimum required contributions. A funding 
standard carryover balance results from a positive 
balance in the funding standard account that ap-
plied under the funding requirements in effect before 
PPA. Subject to certain conditions, a prefunding 
balance or funding standard carryover balance may 
be credited against the minimum required contribu-
tion for a year, reducing the amount that must be 
contributed. 
24 If the plan has obtained a waiver of the min-
imum required contribution (a funding waiver) with-
in the past five years, the minimum required con-
tribution also includes the related waiver amortiza-
tion charge, that is, the annual installment needed 
to amortize the waived amount in level installments 
over the five years following the year of the waiver. 
25 If the value of plan assets, reduced only by any 
prefunding balance if the employer elects to apply 
the prefunding balance against the required con-
tribution for the plan year, is at least equal to the 
plan’s funding target, no shortfall amortization base 
is established for the year. 
26 Under PRA 2010, employers were permitted to 
elect to use one of two alternative extended amorti-
zation schedules for up to two ‘‘eligible’’ plan years 
during the period 2008–2011. The use of an extended 
amortization schedule has the effect of reducing the 
amount of the shortfall amortization installments 
attributable to the shortfall amortization base for 
the eligible plan year. However, the shortfall amor-
tization installments attributable to an eligible plan 
year may be increased by an additional amount, an 
‘‘installment acceleration amount,’’ in the case of 
employee compensation exceeding $1 million, ex-
traordinary dividends, or stock redemptions within 
a certain period of the eligible plan year.

limits to lump sums (and the certain other 
forms of benefit). 
Limits apply to the amount of plan con-
tributions that may be deducted by an em-
ployer.35 In the case of a single-employer de-
fined benefit plan, the plan’s funding target 
and target normal cost, determined using 
the segment rates that apply for funding 
purposes, are taken into account in calcu-
lating the limit on deductible contributions. 
Subject to various conditions, a qualified 
transfer of excess assets of a single-employer 
defined benefit plan to a retiree medical ac-
count within the plan may be made in order 
to fund retiree health benefits.36 For this 
purpose, excess assets generally means the 
excess, if any, of the value of the plan’s as-
sets over 125 percent of the sum of the plan’s 
funding target and target normal cost for 
the plan year. 
PBGC premiums and 4010 reporting 
PBGC premiums apply with respect to de-
fined benefit plans covered by ERISA.37 In 
the case of a single-employer defined benefit 
plan, flat-rate premiums apply at a rate of 
$35.00 per participant for 2012.38 If a single- 
employer defined benefit plan has unfunded 
vested benefits, variable-rate premiums also 
apply at a rate of $9 per $1,000 of unfunded 
vested benefits divided by the number of par-
ticipants. For purposes of determining vari-
able-rate premiums, unfunded vested bene-
fits are equal to the excess (if any) of (1) the 
plan’s funding target for the year determined 
as under the minimum funding rules, but 
taking into account only vested benefits, 
over (2) the fair market value of plan assets. 
In determining the plan’s funding target for 
this purpose, the interest rates used are seg-
ment rates determined as under the min-
imum funding rules, but determined on a 
monthly basis, rather than using a 24–month 
average of corporate bond rates. 
In certain circumstances, the contributing 
sponsor of a single-employer plan defined 
benefit pension plan covered by the PBGC 
(and members of the contributing sponsor’s 
controlled group) must provide certain infor-
mation to the PBGC (referred to as ‘‘section 
4010 reporting’’).39 This information includes 
actuarial information with respect to single- 
employer plans maintained by the contrib-
uting sponsor (and controlled group mem-
bers). Section 4010 reporting is required if: (1) 
the funding target attainment percentage at 
the end of the preceding plan year of a plan 
maintained by the contributing sponsor or 
any member of its controlled group is less 
than 80 percent; (2) the conditions for impo-
sition of a lien (i.e., required contributions 
totaling more than $1 million have not been 
made) have occurred with respect to a plan 
maintained by the contributing sponsor or 
any member of its controlled group; or (3) 
minimum funding waivers in excess of $1 
million have been granted with respect to a 
plan maintained by the contributing sponsor 
or any member of its controlled group and 
any portion of the waived amount is still 
outstanding. 
target or target normal cost is an element, is 
cross-referenced elsewhere. 
Funding target attainment percentage 
A plan’s funding target attainment per-
centage for a plan year is the ratio, ex-
pressed as a percentage, that the net value of 
plan assets bears to the plan’s funding target 
for the year. Special rules may apply to a 
plan if its funding target attainment per-
centage is below a certain level. For exam-
ple, funding target attainment percentage is 
used to determine whether a plan is in ‘‘at- 
risk’’ status, so that special actuarial as-
sumptions (‘‘at-risk assumptions’’) must be 
used in determining the plan’s funding tar-
get and target normal cost.28 A plan is in at 
risk status for a plan year if, for the pre-
ceding year: (1) the plan’s funding target at-
tainment percentage, determined without re-
gard to the at-risk assumptions, was less 
than 80 percent, and (2) the plan’s funding 
target attainment percentage, determined 
using the at-risk assumptions (without re-
gard to whether the plan was in at-risk sta-
tus for the preceding year), was less than 70 
percent.29 In addition, special reporting to 
the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation 
(‘‘PBGC’’) may be required if a plan’s funding 
target attainment percentage is less than 80 
percent.30 
Restrictions on benefit increases, certain 
types of benefits and benefit accruals (collec-
tively referred to as ‘‘benefit restrictions’’) 
may apply to a plan if the plan’s adjusted 
funding target attainment percentage is 
below a certain level.31 Adjusted funding tar-
get attainment percentage is determined in 
the same way as funding target attainment 
percentage, except that the net value of plan 
assets and the plan’s funding target are both 
increased by the aggregate amount of pur-
chases of annuities for employees, other than 
highly compensated employees, made by the 
plan during the two preceding plan years. Al-
though anti-cutback rules generally prohibit 
reductions in benefits that have already been 
earned under a plan,32 reductions required to 
comply with the benefit restrictions are per-
mitted. 
Minimum and maximum lump sums, limits on 
deductible contributions, retiree health 
Defined benefit plans commonly allow a 
participant to choose among various forms 
of benefit offered under the plan, such as a 
lump-sum distribution. These optional forms 
of benefit generally must be actuarially 
equivalent to the life annuity benefit pay-
able to the participant at normal retirement 
age. For certain forms of benefit, such as 
lump sums, the benefit amount cannot be 
less than the amount determined using the 
segment rates and a specified mortality 
table.33 For this purpose, however, the seg-
ment rates are determined on a monthly 
basis, rather than using a 24-month average 
of corporate bond rates. 
The amount of benefits under a defined 
benefit plan are subject to certain limits.34 
The segment rates used in determining min-
imum lump sums (and certain other forms of 
benefit) are also used in applying the benefit 
Annual funding notice 
The plan administrator of a defined benefit 
plan must provide an annual funding notice 
to: (1) each participant and beneficiary; (2) 
each labor organization representing such 
amortization charge for the plan year, but 
the resulting shortfall amortization charge 
cannot be less than zero (i.e., negative amor-
tization installments may not offset normal 
cost). 
If the net value of plan assets for a plan 
year is at least equal to the plan’s funding 
target for the year, so the plan has no fund-
ing shortfall, any shortfall amortization 
bases and related shortfall amortization in-
stallments are eliminated.27
As indicated 
above, if the net value of plan assets exceeds 
the plan’s funding target, the excess is ap-
plied against target normal cost in deter-
mining the minimum required contribution. 
Interest rate used to determine target normal 
cost and funding target 
The minimum funding rules for single-em-
ployer plans specify the interest rates and 
other actuarial assumptions that must be 
used in determining the present value of ben-
efits for purposes of a plan’s target normal 
cost and funding target. 
Present value is determined using three in-
terest rates (‘‘segment’’ rates), each of which 
applies to benefit payments expected to be 
made from the plan during a certain period. 
The first segment rate applies to benefits 
reasonably determined to be payable during 
the five-year period beginning on the first 
day of the plan year; the second segment 
rate applies to benefits reasonably deter-
mined to be payable during the 15-year pe-
riod following the initial five-year period; 
and the third segment rate applies to bene-
fits reasonably determined to be payable at 
the end of the 15-year period. Each segment 
rate is a single interest rate determined 
monthly by the Secretary of the Treasury 
(‘‘Secretary’’) on the basis of a corporate 
bond yield curve, taking into account only 
the portion of the yield curve based on cor-
porate bonds maturing during the particular 
segment rate period. The corporate bond 
yield curve used for this purpose reflects the 
average, for the 24-month period ending with 
the preceding month, of yields on investment 
grade corporate bonds with varying matu-
rities and that are in the top three quality 
levels available. The Internal Revenue Serv-
ice (IRS) publishes the segment rates each 
month. 
The present value of liabilities under a 
plan is determined using the segment rates 
for the ‘‘applicable month’’ for the plan year. 
The applicable month is the month that in-
cludes the plan’s valuation date for the plan 
year, or, at the election of the employer, any 
of the four months preceding the month that 
includes the valuation date. 
Solely for purposes of determining min-
imum required contributions, in lieu of the 
segment rates described above, an employer 
may elect to use interest rates on a yield 
curve based on the yields on investment 
grade corporate bonds for the month pre-
ceding the month in which the plan year be-
gins (i.e., without regard to the 24-month 
averaging described above) (‘‘monthly yield 
curve’’). If an election to use a monthly yield 
curve is made, it cannot be revoked without 
IRS approval. 
Use of segment rates for other purposes 
In general 
In addition to being used to determine a 
plan’s funding target and target normal cost, 
the segment rates are used also for other 
purposes, either directly because the seg-
ment rates themselves are specifically cross- 
referenced or indirectly because funding tar-
get, target normal cost, or some other con-
cept, such as funding target attainment per-
centage (discussed below) in which funding 
28 If a plan is in at-risk status, under section 
409A(b)(3), limitations apply on the employer’s abil-
ity to set aside assets to provide benefits under a 
nonqualified deferred compensation plan. 
29 A similar test applies in order for an employer to 
be permitted to apply a prefunding balance against 
its required contribution, that is, for the preceding 
year, the ratio of the value of plan assets (reduced 
by any prefunding balance) must be at least 80 per-
cent of the plan’s funding target (determined with-
out regard to the at-risk rules).

In addition to the information required to 
be provided in all funding notices, certain in-
formation must be provided in the case of a 
single-employer defined benefit plan, includ-
ing: 
a statement as to whether the plan’s fund-
ing target attainment percentage (as defined 
under the minimum funding rules) for the 
plan year to which the notice relates and the 
two preceding plan years, is at least 100 per-
cent (and, if not, the actual percentages); 
and 
a statement of (a) the total assets (sepa-
rately stating any funding standard carry-

isfy the notice requirement. 
HOUSE BILL 
No provision. 
Annual funding notice 
The conference agreement requires addi-
tional information to be included in the an-
nual funding notice in the case of an applica-
ble plan year. For this purpose, an applicable 
plan year is any plan year beginning after 
December 31, 2011, and before January 1, 2015, 
for which (1) the plan’s funding target, deter-
mined using segment rates as adjusted to re-
flect average segment rates (‘‘adjusted’’ seg-
ment rates), is less than 95 percent of the 
funding target determined without regard to 
adjusted segment rates (that is, determined 
as under present law), (2) the plan has a 
funding shortfall, determined without regard 
to adjusted segment rates, greater than 
$500,000 and (3) the plan had 50 or more par-
ticipants on any day during the preceding 
plan year. 
The additional information that must be 
provided is: 
a statement that MAP–21 modified the 
method for determining the interest rates 
used to determine the actuarial value of ben-
efits earned under the plan, providing for a 
25-year average of interest rates to be taken 
into account in addition to a 2-year average; 
a statement that, as a result of MAP–21, 
the plan sponsor may contribute less money 
to the plan when interest rates are at histor-
ical lows, and 
a table showing, for the applicable plan 
year and each of the two preceding plan 
years, the plan’s funding target attainment 
percentage, funding shortfall, and the em-
ployer’s minimum required contribution, 
each determined both using adjusted seg-
ment rates and without regard to adjusted 
segment rates (that is, as under present law). 
In the case of a preceding plan year begin-
ning before January 1, 2012, the plan’s fund-
ing target attainment percentage, funding 
shortfall, and the employer’s minimum re-
quired contribution provided are determined 
only without regard to adjusted segment 
rates (that is, as under present law). 
As under present law, a funding notice may 
also include any additional information that 
the plan administrator elects to include to 
the extent not inconsistent with regulations. 
For example, a funding notice may include a 
statement of the amount of the employer’s 
actual or planned contributions to the plan. 
The Secretary of Labor is directed to mod-
ify the model funding notice required so that 
the model includes the additional informa-
tion in a prominent manner, for example, on 
a separate first page before the remainder of 
the notice. 
C. Transfer of Excess Pension Assets 
(secs. 40310 and 40311 of the Senate amend-
ment, secs. 40241 and 40242 of the con-
ference agreement, and sec. 420 of the 
Code) 
SENATE AMENDMENT 
The Senate amendment revises the rules 
for determining the segment rates under the 
single-employer plan funding rules by ad-
justing a segment rate if the rate determined 
under the regular rules is outside a specified 
range of the average of the segment rates for 
the preceding 25-year period (‘‘average’’ seg-
ment rates). In particular, if a segment rate 
determined for an applicable month under 
the regular rules is less than the applicable 
minimum percentage, the segment rate is 
adjusted upward to match that percentage. If 
a segment rate determined for an applicable 
month under the regular rules is more than 
the applicable maximum percentage, the seg-
ment rate is adjusted downward to match 
that percentage. For this purpose, the aver-
age segment rate is the average of the seg-
ment rates determined under the regular 
rules for the 25-year period ending Sep-
tember 30 of the calendar year preceding the 
calendar year in which the plan year begins. 
The Secretary is to determine average seg-
ment rates on an annual basis and may pre-
scribe equivalent rates for any years in the 
25-year period for which segment rates deter-
mined under the regular rules are not avail-
able. The Secretary is directed to publish the 
average segment rates each month. 
The applicable minimum percentage and 
the applicable maximum percentage depend 
on the calendar year in which the plan year 
begins as shown by the following table:

The special effective date rule is modified 
under the conference agreement so that an 
employer may elect, for any plan year begin-
ning before January 1, 2013, not to have the 
provision apply either (1) for all purposes for 
which the provision would otherwise apply, 
or (2) solely for purposes of determining the 
plan’s adjusted funding target attainment 
percentage (used in applying the benefit re-
strictions) for that year. A plan is not treat-
ed as failing to meet the requirements of the 
anti-cutback rules solely by reason of an 
election under the special rule. 
Under the conference agreement, if, as of 
the date of enactment, an employer election 
is in effect to use a monthly yield curve in 
determining minimum required contribu-
tions, rather than segment rates, the em-
ployer may revoke the election (and use seg-
ment rates, as modified by the conference 
agreement provision) without obtaining IRS 
approval. The revocation must be made at 
any time before the date that is one year 
after the date of enactment, and the revoca-
tion will be effective for the first plan year 
to which the amendments made by the provi-
sion apply and all subsequent plan years. 
The employer is not precluded from making 
a subsequent election to use a monthly yield 
curve in determining minimum required con-
tributions in accordance with present law.

Defined benefit pension plan reversions 
Defined benefit plan assets generally may 
not revert to an employer prior to termi-
nation of the plan and satisfaction of all plan 
liabilities.45 Upon plan termination, the ac-
crued benefits of all plan participants are re-
quired to be 100-percent vested. A reversion 
prior to plan termination may constitute a 
prohibited transaction and may result in 
plan disqualification. Any assets that revert 
to the employer upon plan termination are 
includible in the gross income of the em-
ployer and subject to an excise tax. The ex-
cise tax rate is 20 percent if the employer 
maintains a replacement plan or makes cer-
tain benefit increases in connection with the 
termination; if not, the excise tax rate is 50 
45 In addition, a reversion may occur only if the 
terms of the plan so provide.

A pension plan may provide life insurance 
benefits for employees (including retirees) 
but only to the extent that the benefits are

vided under the plan.55 The cost of term life

percent. Medical benefits and life insurance 
benefits provided under a pension plan 
Retiree medical accounts 
A pension plan may provide medical bene-
fits to retired employees through a separate 
account that is part of a defined benefit plan 
(‘‘retiree medical accounts’’).46 Medical bene-
fits provided through a retiree medical ac-
count are generally not includible in the re-
tired employee’s gross income.47 
Transfers of excess pension assets 
In general 
A qualified transfer of excess assets of a 
defined benefit plan, including a multiem-
ployer plan,48 to a retiree medical account 
within the plan may be made in order to 
fund retiree health benefits.49 A qualified 
transfer does not result in plan disqualifica-
tion, is not a prohibited transaction, and is 
not treated as a reversion. Thus, transferred 
assets are not includible in the gross income 
of the employer and are not subject to the 
excise tax on reversions. No more than one 
qualified transfer may be made in any tax-
able year. No qualified transfer may be made 
after December 31, 2013. 
Excess assets generally means the excess, 
if any, of the value of the plan’s assets 50 over 
125 percent of the sum of the plan’s funding 
target and target normal cost for the plan 
year. In addition, excess assets transferred in 
a qualified transfer may not exceed the 
amount reasonably estimated to be the 
amount that the employer will pay out of 
such account during the taxable year of the 
transfer for qualified current retiree health 
liabilities. No deduction is allowed to the 
employer for (1) a qualified transfer, or (2) 
the payment of qualified current retiree 
health liabilities out of transferred funds 
(and any income thereon). In addition, no de-
duction is allowed for amounts paid other 
than from transferred funds for qualified cur-
rent retiree health liabilities to the extent 
such amounts are not greater than the ex-
cess of (1) the amount transferred (and any 
income thereon), over (2) qualified current 
retiree health liabilities paid out of trans-
ferred assets (and any income thereon). An 
employer may not contribute any amount to 
a health benefits account or welfare benefit 
fund with respect to qualified current retiree 
health liabilities for which transferred assets 
are required to be used. 
Transferred assets (and any income there-
on) must be used to pay qualified current re-
tiree health liabilities for the taxable year of 
the transfer. Transferred amounts generally 
must benefit pension plan participants, other 
than key employees, who are entitled upon 
retirement to receive retiree medical bene-
fits through the separate account. Retiree 
health benefits of key employees may not be 
paid out of transferred assets. 
Amounts not used to pay qualified current 
retiree health liabilities for the taxable year 
of the transfer are to be returned to the gen-
eral assets of the plan. These amounts are 
not includible in the gross income of the em-
ployer, but are treated as an employer rever-
sion and are subject to a 20-percent excise 
tax. 
In order for the transfer to be qualified, ac-
crued retirement benefits under the pension 
plan generally must be 100-percent vested as 
if the plan terminated immediately before 
the transfer (or in the case of a participant 
who separated in the one-year period ending 
on the date of the transfer, immediately be-
fore the separation). 
In order for a transfer to be qualified, there 
is maintenance of effort requirement under 
which, the employer generally must main-
tain retiree health benefits at the same level 
for the taxable year of the transfer and the 
following four years. 
In addition, the Employee Retirement In-
come Security Act of 1974 (‘‘ERISA’’)51 pro-
vides that, at least 60 days before the date of 
a qualified transfer, the employer must no-
tify the Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of 
the Treasury, employee representatives, and 
the plan administrator of the transfer, and 
the plan administrator must notify each 
plan participant and beneficiary of the trans-
fer.52 
Qualified future transfers and collectively 
bargained transfers 
If certain requirements are satisfied, trans-
fers of excess pension assets under a single- 
employer plan to retiree medical accounts to 
fund the expected cost of retiree medical 
benefits are permitted for the current and fu-
ture years (a ‘‘qualified future transfer’’) and 
such transfers are also allowed in the case of 
benefits provided under a collective bar-
gaining agreement (a ‘‘collectively bargained 
transfer’’).53 Transfers must be made for at 
least a two-year period. An employer can 
elect to make a qualified future transfer or a 
collectively bargained transfer rather than a 
qualified transfer. A qualified future transfer 
or collectively bargained transfer must meet 
the requirements applicable to qualified 
transfers, except that the provision modifies 
the rules relating to: (1) the determination of 
excess pension assets; (2) the limitation on 
the amount transferred; and (3) the mainte-
nance of effort requirement. The general 
sunset applicable to qualified transfer ap-
plies (i.e., no transfers can be made after De-
cember 31, 2013). 
Qualified future transfers and collectively 
bargained transfers can be made to the ex-
tent that plan assets exceed 120 percent of 
the sum of the plan’s funding target and the 
normal cost for the plan year. During the 
transfer period, the plan’s funded status 
must be maintained at the minimum level 
required to make transfers. If the minimum 
level is not maintained, the employer must 
make contributions to the plan to meet the 
minimum level or an amount required to 
meet the minimum level must be transferred 
from the health benefits account. The trans-
fer period is the period not to exceed a total 
of ten consecutive taxable years beginning 
with the taxable year of the transfer. As pre-
viously discussed, the period must be not 
less than two consecutive years. 
Employer provided group-term life insurance 
Group-term life insurance coverage pro-
vided under a policy carried by an employer 
is includible in the gross income of an em-
ployee (including a former employee) but 
only to the extent that the cost exceeds the 
sum of the cost of $50,000 of such insurance 
plus the amount, if any, paid by the em-
ployee toward the purchase of such insur-
ance.54 Special rules apply for determining 
the cost of group-term life insurance that is 
SENATE AMENDMENT 
Extension of existing provisions 
The provision allows qualified transfers, 
qualified future transfers, and collectively 
bargained transfers to retiree medical ac-
counts to be made through December 31, 
2021. No transfers are permitted after that 
date. 
Transfers to fund retiree group-term life insur-
ance permitted 
The provision allows qualified transfers, 
qualified future transfers, and collectively 
bargained transfers to be made to fund the 
purchase of retiree group-term life insur-
ance. The assets transferred for the purchase 
of group-term life insurance must be main-
tained in a separate account within the plan 
(‘‘retiree life insurance account’’), which 
must be separate both from the assets in the 
retiree medical account and from the other 
assets in the defined benefit plan. 
Under the provision, the general rule that 
the cost of group-term life insurance cov-
erage provided under a defined benefit plan 
is includable in gross income of the partici-
pant does not apply to group-term life insur-
ance provided through a retiree life insur-
ance account. Instead, the general rule for 
determining the amount of employer-pro-
vided group-term life insurance that is in-
cludible in gross income applies. However, 
group-term life insurance coverage is per-
mitted to be provided through a retiree life 
insurance account only to the extent that it 
is not includible in gross income. Thus, gen-
erally, only group-term life insurance not in 
excess of $50,000 may be purchased with such 
transferred assets. 
Generally, the present law rules for trans-
fers of excess pension assets to retiree med-
ical accounts to fund retiree health benefits 
also apply to transfers to retiree life insur-
ance accounts to fund retiree group-term 
life. However, generally, the rules are ap-
plied separately. Thus, for example, the one- 
transfer-a-year rule generally applies sepa-
rately to transfers to retiree life insurance 
accounts and transfers to retiree medical ac-
counts. Further, the maintenance of effort 
requirement for qualified transfers applies 
separately to life insurance benefits and 
health benefits. Similarly, for qualified fu-
ture transfers and collectively bargained 
transfers for retiree group-term life insur-
ance, the maintenance of effort and other 
special rules are applied separately to trans-
fers to retiree life insurance accounts and re-
tiree medical accounts. 
Reflecting the inherent differences be-
tween life insurance coverage and health 
coverage, certain rules are not applied to 
transfers to retiree life insurance accounts, 
such as the special rules allowing the em-
ployer to elect to determine the applicable 
employer cost for health coverage during the 
cost maintenance period separately for retir-
ees eligible for Medicare and retirees not eli-
gible for Medicare. However, a separate test 
is allowed for the cost of retiree group-term 
life insurance for retirees under age 65 and 
those retirees who have reached age 65. 
The provision makes other technical and 
conforming changes to the rules for transfers

52 ERISA sec. 101(e). ERISA also provides that a

In general, the excise tax on tobacco prod-
ucts and cigarette papers and tubes manufac-
tured in the United States comes into exist-
ence when the products are manufactured 
and is determined and payable when the to-
bacco products or cigarette papers and tubes 
are removed from the bonded premises of the 
manufacturer. ‘‘Tobacco products’’ means ci-
gars, cigarettes, smokeless tobacco (snuff 
and chewing tobacco), pipe tobacco, and roll 
your own tobacco. Processed tobacco is regu-
lated under the internal revenue laws but no 
excise tax is imposed. Tobacco products and 
cigarette papers and tubes may be exported 
from the United States without payment of 
tax. 
Manufacturers and importers of tobacco 
products or processed tobacco are subject to 
certain permitting, bonding, reporting, and 
record keeping requirements. ‘‘Manufacturer 
of tobacco products’’ means any person who 
manufactures cigars, cigarettes, smokeless 
tobacco, pipe tobacco, or roll-your-own to-
bacco. There is an exception for a person who 
produces these products for their own per-
sonal consumption or use. 
HOUSE BILL 
No provision. 
PRESENT LAW 
The Code imposes an early distribution tax 
on distributions made from qualified retire-
ment plans before an employee attains age 
591⁄2.57 The tax is equal to 10 percent of the 
amount of the distribution that is includible 
in gross income. The 10–percent tax is in ad-
dition to the taxes that would otherwise be 
due on distribution. Certain exceptions to 
the early distribution tax apply including an 
exception for distributions after separation 
from service with the employer after attain-
ing age 55, or in the form of substantially 
equal periodic payments from the qualified 
retirement plan commencing after separa-
tion from service at any age. However, there 
is no exception for annuity payments that 
commence before separating from service 
with the employer.

tion 100112 of the conference agreement, 
and sec. 5702(d) of the Code) 
SENATE AMENDMENT 
No provision. 
SENATE AMENDMENT 
The provision amends the definition of 
manufacturer of tobacco products to include 
any person who for commercial purposes 
makes available machines capable of making 
tobacco products for consumer use. This in-
cludes making a machine available for con-
sumers to produce tobacco products for per-
sonal consumption or use. The addition of 
this provision is not intended to change the 
treatment of such machines under present 
law, or to make taxable the sale, at retail, 
for a consumer’s personal home use, a ma-
chine designed to produce tobacco only in 
personal use quantities, where the machine 
is not used on the retail premises. 
For purposes of imposing the tax liability, 
the person making the machine available for 
consumer use is deemed to be the person 
making the removal with respect to any to-
bacco products manufactured by the ma-
chine. 
Effective date.—The provision is effective 
for articles removed after the date of enact-
ment. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT 
The Senate amendment and the Conference 
agreement include a new Federal Phased Re-
tirement Program under which a Federal 
agency may allow a full-time retirement eli-
gible employee to elect to enter phased re-
tirement status in accordance with regula-
tions issued by the Office of Personnel Man-
agement (OPM).58 During that status, gen-
erally, the employee’s work schedule is a 
percentage of a full time work schedule, and 
the employee receives a phased retirement 
annuity. At full-time retirement, the phased 
retiree is entitled to a composite retirement 
annuity that also includes the portion of the 
employee’s retirement annuity attributable 
to the reduced work schedule. The Con-
ference agreement includes an exception to 
the early distribution tax for payments 
under a phased retirement annuity and a 
composite retirement annuity received by an 
employee participating in this new Federal 
Phased Retirement Program. 
Effective date.—The provision is effective 
on the effective date of implementing regula-
tions issued by OPM implementing the Fed-
eral Phased Retirement Program.

CONFERENCE AGREEMENT 
The conference agreement includes the 
Senate amendment with the following modi-
fication. The provision is modified to clarify 
that a person who sells a machine directly to 
a consumer at retail for the consumer’s per-
sonal home use is not a manufacturer of to-
bacco products under the provision if the 
machine is not used at a retail establishment 
and is designed to produce only personal use 
quantities.

certain items, including tax-exempt interest, 
excluded from taxable income but included 
in the corporation’s earnings and profits.69 
The American Recovery and Reinvestment 
Act of 2009 (‘‘2009 Act’’) provided that tax-ex-

For these purposes, a refunding bond gen-

requirements of the section 265(b)(3) quali-
fied small issuer exception, the portion of 
the proceeds of a qualified financing issue 
that are loaned to a ‘‘qualified borrower’’ 
that participates in the issue were treated as 
a separate issue with respect to which the 
qualified borrower is deemed to be the issuer. 
A ‘‘qualified financing issue’’ was any com-
posite, pooled, or other conduit financing 
issue the proceeds of which were used di-
rectly or indirectly to make or finance loans 
to one or more ultimate borrowers all of 
whom are qualified borrowers. A ‘‘qualified 
borrower’’ meant (1) a State or political sub-
division of a State or (2) an organization de-
scribed in section 501(c)(3) and exempt from 
tax under section 501(a). Thus, for example, a 
$100 million pooled financing issue that was 
issued in 2009 would qualify for the section 
265(b)(3) exception if the proceeds of such 
issue were used to make four equal loans of 
$25 million to four qualified borrowers. How-
ever, if (1) more than $30 million were loaned 
to any qualified borrower, (2) any borrower 
were not a qualified borrower, or (3) any bor-
rower would, if it were the issuer of a sepa-
rate issue in an amount equal to the amount 
loaned to such borrower, fail to meet any of 
the other requirements of section 265(b)(3), 
the entire $100 million pooled financing issue 
failed to qualify for the exception. 
For purposes of determining whether an 
issuer meets the requirements of the small 
issuer exception, under the special rules, 
qualified 501(c)(3) bonds issued in 2009 or 2010 
were treated as if they were issued by the 
501(c)(3) organization for whose benefit they 
were issued (and not by the actual issuer of 
such bonds). In addition, in the case of an or-
ganization described in section 501(c)(3) and 
exempt from taxation under section 501(a), 
requirements for ‘‘qualified financing issues’’ 
were applied as if the section 501(c)(3) organi-
zation were the issuer. Thus, in any event, 
an organization described in section 501(c)(3) 
and exempt from taxation under section 
501(a) was limited to the $30 million per 
issuer cap for qualified tax exempt obliga-
tions described in section 265(b)(3). 
PRESENT LAW 
There are no Code provisions for the 
issuance of transportation and regional in-
frastructure project (‘‘TRIP’’) bonds. 
HOUSE BILL 
No provision. 
HOUSE BILL 
No provision. 
SENATE AMENDMENT 
The provision extends the special rules 
providing modifications to the qualified 
small issuer exception to bonds issued after 
June 30, 2012 and before July 1, 2013. 
Effective date.—The provision is effective 
for obligations issued after June 30, 2012. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT 
The conference agreement does not include 
the Senate amendment provision. 
B. Temporary Modification of Alternative 
Minimum Tax Limitations on Tax-Exempt 
Bonds (sec. 40202 of the Senate amendment 
and secs. 56 and 57 of the Code) 
interest deduction is disallowed only if the 
taxpayer has a purpose of using borrowed 
funds to purchase or carry tax-exempt obli-
gations; a determination of the taxpayer’s 
purpose in borrowing funds is made based on 
all of the facts and circumstances.61 
Financial institutions 
In the case of a financial institution, the 
Code generally disallows that portion of the 
taxpayer’s interest expense that is allocable 
to tax-exempt interest.62 The amount of in-
terest that is disallowed is an amount which 
bears the same ratio to such interest expense 
as the taxpayer’s average adjusted bases of 
tax-exempt obligations acquired after Au-
gust 7, 1986, bears to the average adjusted 
bases for all assets of the taxpayer. 
Exception for certain obligations of qualified 
small issuers 
The general rule in section 265(b), denying 
financial institutions’ interest expense de-
ductions allocable to tax-exempt obligations, 
does not apply to ‘‘qualified tax-exempt obli-
gations.’’ 63 Instead, as discussed in the next 
section, only 20 percent of the interest ex-
pense allocable to ‘‘qualified tax-exempt ob-
ligations’’ is disallowed.64 A ‘‘qualified tax- 
exempt obligation’’ is a tax-exempt obliga-
tion that is (1) issued after August 7, 1986, by 
a qualified small issuer, (2) not a private ac-
tivity bond, and (3) designated by the issuer 
as qualifying for the exception from the gen-
eral rule of section 265(b). 
A ‘‘qualified small issuer’’ is an issuer that 
reasonably anticipates that the amount of 
tax-exempt obligations that it will issue dur-
ing the calendar year will be $10 million or 
less.65 The Code specifies the circumstances 
under which an issuer and all subordinate 
entities are aggregated.66 For purposes of the 
$10 million limitation, an issuer and all enti-
ties that issue obligations on behalf of such 
issuer are treated as one issuer. All obliga-
tions issued by a subordinate entity are 
treated as being issued by the entity to 
which it is subordinate. An entity formed (or 
availed of) to avoid the $10 million limita-
tion and all entities benefiting from the de-
vice are treated as one issuer. 
Composite issues (i.e., combined issues of 
bonds for different entities) qualify for the 
‘‘qualified tax-exempt obligation’’ exception 
only if the requirements of the exception are 
met with respect to (1) the composite issue 
as a whole (determined by treating the com-
posite issue as a single issue) and (2) each 
separate lot of obligations that is part of the 
issue (determined by treating each separate 
lot of obligations as a separate issue).67 Thus 
a composite issue may qualify for the excep-
tion only if the composite issue itself does 
not exceed $10 million, and if each issuer 
benefitting from the composite issue reason-
ably anticipates that it will not issue more 
than $10 million of tax-exempt obligations 
during the calendar year, including through 
the composite arrangement. 
Special rules providing modifications to quali-
fied small issuer exception for certain 
issues in 2009 and 2010 
With respect to tax-exempt obligations 
issued during 2009 and 2010, the special rules 
increased from $10 million to $30 million the 
annual limit for qualified small issuers. 
PRESENT LAW 
Present law imposes an alternative min-
imum tax (‘‘AMT’’) on individuals and cor-
porations. AMT is the amount by which the 
tentative minimum tax exceeds the regular 
income tax. The tentative minimum tax is 
computed based upon a taxpayer’s alter-
native minimum taxable income (‘‘AMTI’’). 
AMTI is the taxpayer’s taxable income modi-
fied to take into account certain preferences 
and adjustments. One of the preference items 
is tax-exempt interest on certain tax-exempt 
bonds issued for private activities.68 Also, in 
SENATE AMENDMENT 
The provision amends Title 23 to provide 
that a State, through a State infrastructure 
bank, may issue TRIP bonds and deposit the 
proceeds from such bonds into a TRIP bond 
account of the bank. A ‘‘TRIP bond’’ means 
any bond issued as part of an issue if (1) 100 
percent of the available project proceeds of 
such issue are to be used for expenditures in-
curred after the date of enactment for one or 
more qualified projects pursuant to an allo-
cation of such proceeds to such project or 
projects by a State infrastructure bank, (2) 
the bond is issued by a State infrastructure 
bank and is in registered form (within the 
meaning of section 149 of the Internal Rev-
enue Code), (3) the State infrastructure bank 
designates such bond for purposes of the pro-
vision and (4) the term of each bond that is 
part of such issue does not exceed 30 years. A 
‘‘qualified project’’ means the capital im-
provements to any transportation infra-
structure project of any governmental unit 
or other person, including roads, bridges, rail 
and transit systems, ports and, inland water-
ways proposed and approved by a State infra-
structure bank, but does not include costs of

the ordinary course of such person’s trade or busi-
ness and is subject to Federal or State supervision

scribed by section 585(a)(2). Sec. 265(b)(5).

June 28, 2012 
HOUSE BILL 
No provision. 
SENATE AMENDMENT 
The provision exempts two types of exempt 
facility bonds from the annual private activ-
ity volume limits. The newly-exempted 
bonds are exempt facility bonds for sewage 
and water facilities. 
The provision only applies to bonds issued 
before January 1, 2018. 
Effective date.—The provision is effective 
for bonds issued after the date of enactment. 
for the entirety of 2012. In order for the ex-
tension to be effective retroactive to Janu-
ary 1, 2012, it is intended that expenses in-
curred prior to enactment by an employee 
for employer-provided vanpool and transit 
benefits may be reimbursed by employers on 
a tax free basis to the extent they exceed 
$125 per month and are less than $240 per 
month, but only to the extent that such 
amount has not already been excluded from 
such employee’s taxable compensation. 
Effective date.—The provision in the Senate 
amendment is effective for months after De-
cember 31, 2011. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT 
The conference agreement does not include 
the Senate amendment provision. 
F. Dedication of Gas Guzzler Tax to the 
Highway Trust Fund (sec. 40303 of the Sen-
ate amendment and sec. 9503 of the Code) 
operations or maintenance with respect to 
such project. 
The provision requires a State to develop a 
transparent and competitive process for the 
award of funds deposited into the TRIP bond 
account that considers the impact of quali-
fied projects on the economy, the environ-
ment, state of good repair, and equity. The 
requirements of any Federal law, including 
Title 23 and Titles 40 and 49, which would 
otherwise apply to projects to which the 
United States is a party or to funds made 
available under such law and projects as-
sisted with those funds shall apply to (1) 
funds made available under the TRIP bond 
account for similar qualified projects and (2) 
similar qualified projects assisted through 
the use of such funds. 
Effective date.—The provision is effective 
on the date of enactment. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT 
The conference agreement does not include 
the Senate amendment provision. 
D. Mass Transit and Parking Benefits (sec. 
40204 of the Senate amendment, and sec. 
132(f) of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW 
Under present law, the Code imposes a tax 
(‘‘the gas guzzler tax’’) on automobiles that 
are manufactured primarily for use on public 
streets, roads, and highways and that are 
rated at 6,000 pounds unloaded gross vehicle 
weight or less.75 The tax is imposed on the 
sale by the manufacturer of each automobile 
of a model type with a fuel economy of 22.5 
miles per gallon or less. The tax range begins 
at $1,000 and increases to $7,700 for models 
with a fuel economy less than 12.5 miles per 
gallon. 
Emergency 
vehicles 
and 
non-passenger 
automobiles are exempt from the tax. The 
tax also does not apply to non-passenger 
automobiles. The Secretary of Transpor-
tation determines which vehicles are ‘‘non- 
passenger’’ automobiles, thereby exempting 
these vehicles from the gas guzzler tax based 
on regulations in effect on the date of enact-
ment of the gas guzzler tax.76 Hence, vehicles 
defined in Title 49 C.F.R. sec. 523.5 (relating 
to light trucks) are exempt. These vehicles 
include those designed to transport property 
on an open bed (e.g., pick-up trucks) or pro-
vide greater cargo-carrying than passenger 
carrying volume including the expanded 
cargo-carrying space created through the re-
moval of readily detachable seats (e.g., pick- 
up trucks, vans, and most minivans, sports 
utility vehicles, and station wagons). Addi-
tional vehicles that meet the ‘‘non-pas-
senger’’ requirements are those with at least 
four of the following characteristics: (1) an 
angle of approach of not less than 28 degrees; 
(2) a breakover angle of not less than 14 de-
grees; (3) a departure angle of not less than 
20 degrees; (4) a running clearance of not less 
than 20 centimeters; and (5) front and rear 
axle clearances of not less than 18 centi-
meters each. These vehicles would include 
many sports utility vehicles. 
HOUSE BILL 
No provision. 
SENATE AMENDMENT 
The provision requires that amounts equiv-
alent to the gas guzzler taxes received in the 
Treasury be transferred to the Highway 
Trust Fund. 
Effective date.—The provision is effective 
on the date of enactment. 
PRESENT LAW 
Qualified transportation fringe benefits 
provided by an employer are excluded from 
an employee’s gross income for income tax 
purposes and from an employee’s wages for 
payroll tax purposes.70 Qualified transpor-
tation fringe benefits include parking, tran-
sit passes, vanpool benefits, and qualified bi-
cycle 
commuting 
reimbursements. 
No 
amount is includible in the income of an em-
ployee merely because the employer offers 
the employee a choice between cash and 
qualified 
transportation 
fringe 
benefits 
(other than a qualified bicycle commuting 
reimbursement). 
Qualified 
transportation 
fringe benefits also include a cash reimburse-
ment by an employer to an employee. In the 
case of transit passes, however, a cash reim-
bursement is considered a qualified transpor-
tation fringe benefit only if a voucher or 
similar item which may be exchanged only 
for a transit pass is not readily available for 
direct distribution by the employer to the 
employee. 
Prior to February 17, 2009, the amount that 
could be excluded as qualified transportation 
fringe benefits was limited to $100 per month 
in combined vanpooling and transit pass ben-
efits and $175 per month in qualified parking 
benefits. All limits are adjusted annually for 
inflation, using 1998 as the base year (for 2012 
the limits are $125 and $240, respectively). 
The American Recovery and Reinvestment 
Act of 2009 71 provided parity in qualified 
transportation fringe benefits by tempo-
rarily increasing the monthly exclusion for 
employer-provided vanpool and transit pass 
benefits to the same level as the exclusion 
for employer-provided parking, effective for 
months beginning on or after the date of en-
actment (February 17, 2009) and before Janu-
ary 1, 2011. The Tax Relief, Unemployment 
Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation 
Act of 2010 72 extended the parity in qualified 
transportation fringe benefits through De-
cember 31, 2011. 
Effective January 1, 2012, the amount that 
could be excluded as qualified transportation 
fringe benefits is limited to $125 per month 
in combined vanpooling and transit pass ben-
efits and $240 per month in qualified parking 
benefits.

E. Private Activity Volume Cap Exemption 
for Sewage and Water Facility Bonds (sec. 
40205 of the Senate amendment and sec. 
146(g) of the Code) 
In general 
Subject to certain Code restrictions, inter-
est on bonds issued by State and local gov-
ernment generally is excluded from gross in-
come for Federal income tax purposes. Bonds 
issued by State and local governments may 
be classified as either governmental bonds or 
private activity bonds. Governmental bonds 
are bonds the proceeds of which are pri-
marily used to finance governmental func-
tions or which are repaid with governmental 
funds. Private activity bonds are bonds in 
which the State or local government serves 
as a conduit providing financing to non-
governmental persons. For this purpose, the 
term ‘‘nongovernmental person’’ generally 
includes the Federal Government and all 
other individuals and entities other than 
State or local governments. The exclusion 
from income for interest on State and local 
bonds does not apply to private activity 
bonds, unless the bonds are issued for certain 
permitted purposes (‘‘qualified private activ-
ity bonds’’) and other Code requirements are 
met. 
Qualified private activity bonds 
Interest on private activity bonds is tax-
able unless the bonds meet the requirements 
for qualified private activity bonds. Quali-
fied private activity bonds permit States or 
local governments to act as conduits pro-
viding tax-exempt financing for certain pri-
vate activities. The definition of qualified 
private activity bonds includes an exempt fa-
cility bond, or qualified mortgage, veterans’ 
mortgage, small issue, redevelopment, quali-
fied 501(c)(3), or student loan bond.73 The def-
inition of exempt facility bond includes 
bonds issued to finance certain transpor-
tation facilities (airports, ports, mass com-
muting, and high-speed intercity rail facili-
ties); qualified residential rental projects; 
privately owned and/or operated utility fa-
cilities (sewage, water, solid waste disposal, 
and local district heating and cooling facili-
ties, certain private electric and gas facili-
ties, and hydroelectric dam enhancements); 
public/private educational facilities; quali-
fied green building and sustainable design 
projects; and qualified highway or surface 
freight transfer facilities.74 
In most cases, the aggregate volume of 
these tax-exempt private activity bonds is 
restricted by annual aggregate volume lim-
its imposed on bonds issued by issuers within 
each State. Certain types of private activity 
bonds are exempted from the annual volume 
limits. 
For calendar year 2012, the State volume 
cap, which is indexed for inflation, equals $95 
per resident of the State, or $284,560,000, 
whichever is greater.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4594 
June 28, 2012 
State may refuse to issue or renew a pass-
port if the applicant owes child support in 
excess of $2,500 or owes certain types of Fed-
eral debts, such as expenses incurred in pro-
viding assistance to an applicant to return 
to the United States. The scope of this au-
thority does not extend to rejection or rev-
ocation of a passport on the basis of delin-
quent Federal taxes. Issuance of a passport 
does not require the applicant to provide a 
social security number or taxpayer identi-
fication number. 
Returns and return information are con-
fidential and may not be disclosed by the 
IRS, other Federal employees, State employ-
ees, and certain others having access to such 
information except as provided in the Inter-
nal Revenue Code.78 There are a number of 
exceptions to the general rule of nondisclo-
sure that authorize disclosure in specifically 
identified circumstances, including disclo-
sure of information about federal tax debts 
for purposes of reviewing an application for a 
Federal loan 79 and for purposes of enhancing 
the integrity of the Medicare program.80 
HOUSE PROVISION 
No provision. 
Payments to Medicare Providers 
In 2008, the Government Accountability Of-
fice (‘‘GAO’’) found that over 27,000 Medicare 
providers (i.e., about six percent of all such 
providers) owed more than $2 billion of tax 
debt, consisting largely of individual income 
and payroll taxes.92 In one case, a home 
health company received over $15 million in 
Medicare payments but did not pay $7 mil-
lion in federal taxes.93 As of 2008, the Centers 
for Medicare & Medicaid Services (‘‘CMS’’) 
had not incorporated most of its Medicare 
payments into the continuous levy program, 
despite the IRS authority to continuously 
levy up to 15 percent of these payments. 
Thus, for calendar year 2006, the government 
lost the chance to possibly collect over $140 
million in unpaid Federal taxes.94 The GAO 
noted that CMS officials promised to incor-
porate about 60 percent of all Medicare fee- 
for-service payments into the levy program 
by October 2008 and the remaining 40 percent 
in the next several years. 
Following the GAO study, Congress di-
rected CMS to participate in the FPLP and 
ensure that all Medicare provider and sup-
plier payments are processed through it, in 
specified graduated percentages, by the end 
of fiscal year 2011.95 
HOUSE PROVISION 
No provision. 
SENATE AMENDMENT 
The provision allows Treasury to levy up 
to 100 percent of a payment to a Medicare 
provider to collect unpaid taxes. 
Effective date.—The provision is effective 
for payments made after the date of enact-
ment. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT 
The conference agreement does not include 
the Senate amendment provision. 
I. Appropriation to the Highway Trust Fund 
of Amounts Attributable to Certain Duties 
on Imported Vehicles (sec. 40306 of the Sen-
ate amendment) 
PRESENT LAW 
Customs duties are deposited into the gen-
eral fund of the Treasury of the United 
States. This includes customs duties col-
lected on imported vehicles classified under 
Chapter 87 of the Harmonized Tariff Sched-
ule of the United States. 
HOUSE BILL 
No provision. 
SENATE AMENDMENT 
If the Commissioner of Internal Revenue 
certifies to the Secretary of the Treasury the 
identity of persons who have seriously delin-
quent Federal taxes, the Secretary of Treas-
ury or his delegate is authorized to transmit 
such certification to the Secretary of State 
for use in determining whether to issue, 
renew, or revoke a passport. Applicants 
whose names are included on the certifi-
cations provided to the Secretary of State 
are ineligible for a passport. The provision 
bars the Secretary of State from issuing a 
passport to any individual who has a seri-
ously delinquent tax debt. It also requires 
revocation of a passport previously issued to 
any such individual. Exceptions are per-
mitted for emergency or humanitarian cir-
cumstances, as well as short term use of a 
passport for return travel to the United 
States by the delinquent taxpayer. 
A seriously delinquent tax debt generally 
includes any outstanding debt for Federal 
tax in excess of $50,000, including interest 
and any penalties, for which a notice of lien 
or a notice of levy has been filed. This 
amount is to be adjusted for inflation annu-
ally, using calendar year 2011, and a cost-of- 
living adjustment. Even if a tax debt other-
wise meets the statutory threshold, it may 
not be considered seriously delinquent if (1) 
the debt is being paid in a timely manner 
pursuant to an installment agreement or 
offer-in-compromise, or (2) collection action 
with respect to the debt is suspended because 
a collection due process hearing or innocent 
spouse relief has been requested or is pend-
ing. 
Effective date.—The provision is effective 
on January 1, 2013. 
SENATE AMENDMENT 
The provision would appropriate from the 
General Fund and deposit into the Highway 
Trust Fund amounts equivalent to amounts 
received in the General Fund, for FY 2012 
through FY 2016, on articles classified under 
subheadings 8703.22.00 and 8703.24.00 of Chap-
ter 87. 
Effective date.—The provision is effective 
on the date of enactment. 
a taxpayer’s property by levy if a Federal 
tax lien has attached to such property,82 the 
property is not exempt from levy,83 and the 
IRS has provided both notice of intention to 
levy 84 and notice of the right to an adminis-
trative hearing (the notice is referred to as a 
‘‘collections due process notice’’ or ‘‘CDP no-
tice’’ and the hearing is referred to as the 
‘‘CDP hearing’’) 85 at least 30 days before the 
levy is made. A levy on salary or wages gen-
erally is continuously in effect until re-
leased.86 A Federal tax lien arises automati-
cally when: (1) a tax assessment has been 
made; (2) the taxpayer has been given notice 
of the assessment stating the amount and 
demanding payment; and (3) the taxpayer 
has failed to pay the amount assessed within 
10 days after the notice and demand.87 
The notice of intent to levy is not required 
if the Secretary finds that collection would 
be jeopardized by delay. The standard for de-
termining whether jeopardy exists is similar 
to the standard applicable when determining 
whether assessment of tax without following 
the normal deficiency procedures is per-
mitted.88 
The CDP notice (and pre-levy CDP hearing) 
is not required if: (1) the Secretary finds that 
collection would be jeopardized by delay; (2) 
the Secretary has served a levy on a State to 
collect a Federal tax liability from a State 
tax refund; (3) the taxpayer subject to the 
levy requested a CDP hearing with respect to 
unpaid employment taxes arising in the two- 
year period before the beginning of the tax-
able period with respect to which the em-
ployment tax levy is served; or (4) the Sec-
retary has served a Federal contractor levy. 
In each of these four cases, however, the tax-
payer is provided an opportunity for a hear-
ing within a reasonable period of time after 
the levy.89 
Federal payment levy program 
To help the IRS collect taxes more effec-
tively, the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 90 au-
thorized the establishment of the Federal 
Payment Levy Program (‘‘FPLP’’), which al-
lows the IRS to continuously levy up to 15 
percent of certain ‘‘specified payments’’ by 
the Federal government if the payees are de-
linquent on their tax obligations. With re-
spect to payments to vendors of goods, serv-
ices, or property sold or leased to the Fed-
eral government, the continuous levy may be 
up to 100 percent of each payment.91 The levy 
(either up to 15 percent or up to 100 percent) 
generally continues in effect until the liabil-
ity is paid or the IRS releases the levy. 
Under FPLP, the IRS matches its accounts 
receivable records with Federal payment 
records maintained by the Department of the 
Treasury’s Financial Management Service 
(‘‘FMS’’), such as certain Social Security 
benefit and Federal wage records. When 
these records match, the delinquent tax-
payer is provided both the notice of inten-
tion to levy and the CDP notice. If the tax-
payer does not respond after 30 days, the IRS 
can instruct FMS to levy the taxpayer’s Fed-
eral payments. Subsequent payments are 
continuously levied until such time that the 
tax debt is paid or the IRS releases the levy.

the Senate amendment provision. 
K. Internal Revenue Service Levies and 
Thrift Savings Plan Accounts (sec. 40308 of 
the Senate amendment) 
HOUSE BILL 
No provision. 
SENATE AMENDMENT 
Under the Senate amendment, in the case 
of a divisive D reorganization, no gain or loss 
is recognized to a corporation if the corpora-
tion is a party to a reorganization and ex-
changes property, in pursuance of the plan of 
reorganization, solely for stock other than 
nonqualified preferred stock (as defined in 
section 351(g)(2)).101 Thus, under the provi-
sion, securities and nonqualified preferred 
stock are treated as ‘‘other property.’’ 
The transferor corporation’s gain on the 
exchange is recognized to the extent of the 
sum of money and the value of other prop-
erty, including securities and nonqualified 
preferred stock, not distributed in pursuance 
of the plan of reorganization. A distribution 
to creditors of the transferor corporation is 
not treated as a distribution for this pur-
pose. 
The value of controlled corporation securi-
ties or nonqualified preferred stock trans-
ferred to creditors of the distributing cor-
poration is treated in the same manner as a 
direct assumption of distributing corpora-
tion’s debt by the controlled corporation, or 
as a distribution of cash (or other non-
qualified property) from the controlled cor-
poration that is paid to the distributing cor-
poration’s creditors, so that the distributing 
corporation recognizes gain on the exchange 
to the extent that the sum of such amounts 
exceeds the adjusted bases of the assets 
transferred 
Effective date.—The provision generally ap-
plies to exchanges occurring after the date of 
enactment. 
However, the provision does not apply to 
any exchange in connection with a trans-
action which is (1) made pursuant to a writ-
ten agreement which was binding on Feb-
ruary 6, 2012 and at all times thereafter, (2) 
described in a ruling request submitted to 
the IRS on or before such date, or (3) de-
scribed on or before such date in a public an-
nouncement or in a filing with the Securities 
and Exchange Commission. 
transferor or one or more of its shareholders, 
qualifies as a tax-free reorganization if the 
transfer is made by one corporation (‘‘dis-
tributing’’) to a controlled subsidiary cor-
poration (‘‘controlled’’), followed by the dis-
tribution of the stock and securities of the 
controlled subsidiary in a divisive spin-off, 
split-off, or split-up which meets the require-
ments of section 355, including an active 
business requirement and a requirement that 
the transaction is not used principally as a 
device for the distribution of earnings and 
profits (‘‘divisive D reorganization’’).96 
No gain or loss is recognized to a corpora-
tion if the corporation is a party to a reorga-
nization and exchanges property, in pursu-
ance of the plan of reorganization, solely for 
stock or securities in another corporation 
that is a party to the reorganization.97 If 
property other than stock or securities is re-
ceived (‘‘other property’’), the transferor cor-
poration recognizes gain (if any) to the ex-
tent the other property is not distributed.98 
In addition, in a divisive D reorganization, 
if there is a transfer to the transferor cor-
poration’s creditors of money or other prop-
erty received from the controlled corpora-
tion in the exchange in connection with the 
reorganization, the transferor distributing 
corporation recognizes gain to the extent the 
sum of the money and the fair market value 
of the other property exceeds the adjusted 
bases of the assets transferred (reduced by 
the amount of liabilities assumed by the 
transferee under section 357(c)).99 Thus, such 
a transfer to creditors is aggregated with 
other assumptions of the transferor corpora-
tion’s liabilities by the transferee, and the 
transferor corporation recognizes gain to the 
extent this aggregate amount exceeds the 
adjusted basis of assets transferred.100 
For example, if in a divisive D reorganiza-
tion the controlled corporation either (1) di-
rectly assumes the debt of the distributing 
corporation, or (2) borrows and distributes 
cash to the distributing corporation to pay 
the distributing corporation’s creditors, such 
debt assumption or cash distribution is 
treated as money received by the distrib-
uting corporation, and the aggregate amount 
of such debt assumptions and distributions is 
taxable to the extent it exceeds the distrib-
uting corporation’s basis in the assets trans-
ferred to the controlled corporation. How-
ever, if the controlled corporation issues its 
own debt securities and such securities are 
distributed to the creditors of the distrib-
uting corporation, the controlled corpora-
tion’s debt securities are not treated as 
money or other property received by the dis-
tributing corporation. Thus, the distributing 
corporation could use the controlled corpora-
tion’s securities to retire the distributing 
corporation’s own debt, recognize no gain, 
and be in the same economic position as if 
its debt had been directly assumed by the 
controlled corporation or as if it had retired 
its debt with cash received from the con-
trolled corporation. In addition, to the ex-
PRESENT LAW 
In general 
Levy is the IRS’s administrative authority 
to seize a taxpayer’s property, or rights to 
property, to pay the taxpayer’s tax liabil-
ity.102 Generally, the IRS is entitled to seize 
a taxpayer’s property by levy if a Federal 
tax lien has attached to such property,103 the 
property is not exempt from levy,104 and the 
IRS has provided both notice of intention to 
levy 105 and notice of the right to an adminis-
trative hearing (the notice is referred to as a 
‘‘collections due process notice’’ or ‘‘CDP no-
tice’’ and the hearing is referred to as the 
‘‘CDP hearing’’) 106 at least 30 days before the 
levy is made. A levy on salary or wages is 
generally continuously in effect until re-
leased.107 A Federal tax lien arises automati-
cally when: (1) a tax assessment has been 
made; (2) the taxpayer has been given notice 
of the assessment stating the amount and 
demanding payment; and (3) the taxpayer 
has failed to pay the amount assessed within 
10 days after the notice and demand.108 
The notice of intent to levy is not required 
if the Secretary finds that collection would 
be jeopardized by delay. The standard for de-
termining whether jeopardy exists is similar 
to the standard applicable when determining 
whether assessment of tax without following 
the normal deficiency procedures is per-
mitted.109 
The CDP notice (and pre-levy CDP hearing) 
is not required if: (1) the Secretary finds that 
collection would be jeopardized by delay; (2) 
the Secretary has served a levy on a State to 
collect a Federal tax liability from a State 
tax refund; (3) the taxpayer subject to the 
levy requested a CDP hearing with respect to 
unpaid employment taxes arising in the two- 
year period before the beginning of the tax-
able period with respect to which the em-
ployment tax levy is served; or (4) the Sec-
retary has served a Federal contractor levy. 
In each of these four cases, however, the tax-
payer is provided an opportunity for a hear-
ing within a reasonable period of time after 
the levy.110 
Thrift Savings Plan 
Present law includes an anti-alienation 
rule that provides that the balance of an em-
ployee’s Thrift Savings Plan (‘‘TSP’’) Ac-
count is subject to taking only for the en-
forcement of one’s obligations to provide for 
child support or alimony payments, restitu-
tion orders, certain forfeitures, or certain 
obligations of the Executive Director.111 The 
authority for the IRS to levy an employee’s 
TSP Account to satisfy tax liabilities is not 
mentioned in the anti-alienation rule; TSP 
Accounts are not specifically enumerated in 
the Code provisions identifying property 
that is exempt from levy. 
HOUSE PROVISION 
No provision. 
96 Secs. 355 and 368(a)(1)(D). Section 355 imposes re-
quirements for a qualified spin-off, split-off, or split- 
up. Among other requirements, in order for a trans-
action to qualify under section 355, the distributing 
corporation must either (i) distribute all of the 
stock and securities of the controlled corporation 
that it holds, or (ii) distribute at least an amount of 
stock constituting control under section 368(c) and 
establish to the satisfaction of the Secretary of the 
Treasury that the retention of stock (or stock and 
securities) was not in pursuance of a plan having as 
one of its principal purposes the avoidance of Fed-
eral income tax. Sec. 355(a)(1)(D). Section 355 im-
poses other requirements to avoid gain recognition

to require the issuer or a related person to redeem 
or purchase the stock, which right may be exercised 
within the 20 year period beginning on the issue date 
and is not subject to a contingency which, as of the 
issue date, makes remote the likelihood of redemp-
tion or purchase; (ii) the issuer or a related person 
is required to redeem or purchase the stock (within 
such 20 year period and not subject to such a contin-
gency); (iii) the issuer or a related person has the 
right to redeem or purchase the stock (which right 
is exercisable within such 20 year period and not

date, it is more likely than not that such right will 
be exercised, or (iv) the dividend on such stock var-
ies in whole or in part (directly or indirectly) with 
reference to interest rates, commodity prices, or 
other similar indices. There are exceptions for cer-
tain rights that are exercisable only on the death, 
disability or mental incompetency of the holder, or 
only upon the separation from service of a service 
provider who received the right as reasonable com-
pensation for services, and for certain situations in-
volving publicly traded stock. Nonqualified pre-
ferred stock is treated in the same manner as securi-
ties under section 351 and thus is not qualified con-
sideration that may be received tax free by a con-
tributing shareholder. Sections 354(a)(2)(C) and 
356(e) treat nonqualified preferred stock as taxable 
consideration if received in exchange for stock by 
shareholders of a corporation that itself is a party 
to a reorganization (except to the extent received in 
exchange for other nonqualified preferred stock); 
and section 355 contains a similar rule (sec. 
355(a)(3)(D)).

SENATE AMENDMENT 
The provision amends the statutory provi-
sions governing the TSP to clarify that the 
anti-alienation provisions therein do not bar 
the IRS from issuing a notice of levy on a 
TSP Account. 
Effective date.—The provision is effective 
upon date of enactment. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT 
The conference agreement does not include 
the Senate amendment provision. 
L. Depreciation and Amortization Rules for 
Highway and Related Property Subject to 
Long-Term Leases (sec. 40309 of the Senate 
amendment and secs. 168, 197, and 147 of the 
Code) 
Under rules known as the transfer for 
value rules, if a life insurance contract is 
sold or otherwise transferred for valuable 
consideration, the amount paid by reason of 
the death of the insured that is excludable 
generally is limited.122 Under the limitation, 
the excludable amount may not exceed the 
sum of (1) the actual value of the consider-
ation, and (2) the premiums or other 
amounts subsequently paid by the transferee 
of the contract. Thus, for example, if a per-
son buys a life insurance contract, and the 
consideration he pays combined with his sub-
sequent premium payments on the contract 
are less than the amount of the death benefit 
he later receives under the contract, then 
the difference is includable in the buyer’s in-
come. 
Exceptions are provided to the limitation 
on the excludable amount. The limitation on 
the excludable amount does not apply if (1) 
the transferee’s basis in the contract is de-
termined in whole or in part by reference to 
the transferor’s basis in the contract,123 or 
(2) the transfer is to the insured, to a partner 
of the insured, to a partnership in which the 
insured is a partner, or to a corporation in 
which the insured is a shareholder or offi-
cer.124 
requires that any amortizable section 197 in-
tangible acquired in connection with an ap-
plicable lease must be recovered over a pe-
riod not less than the term of the applicable 
lease. 
Under this provision, private activity 
bonds are not qualified bonds, interest on 
which is tax-exempt, if the bonds are part of 
an issue, any portion of the proceeds of 
which is used to finance any applicable 
leased highway property. 
For purposes of this provision, applicable 
leased highway property is defined as prop-
erty subject to an applicable lease and 
placed in service before the date of such 
lease. An applicable lease is defined as an ar-
rangement between the taxpayer and a State 
or political subdivision thereof, or any agen-
cy or instrumentality of either, under which 
the taxpayer leases a highway and associated 
improvements, receives a right-of-way on 
the public lands underlying such highway 
and improvements, and receives a grant of a 
franchise or other intangible right permit-
ting the taxpayer to receive funds relating to 
the operation of such highway. As under 
present law, a contract that purports to be a 
service contract or other arrangement (in-
cluding a partnership or other passthrough 
entity) is treated as a lease if the contract or 
arrangement is properly treated as a lease.118 
Effective date.—The provision is effective 
for leases entered into, and private activity 
bonds issued, after the date of enactment. 
IRS guidance sets forth more details of the 
tax treatment of a life insurance policy-
holder who sells or surrenders the life insur-
ance contract and the tax treatment of other 
sellers and of buyers of life insurance con-
tracts. The guidance relates to the character 
of taxable amounts (ordinary or capital) and 
to the taxpayer’s basis in the life insurance 
contract. 
CONFERENE AGREEMENT 
The conference agreement does not include 
the Senate amendment provision. 
M. Transfers to Federal Old-Age and Sur-
vivors Insurance Trust Fund and Federal 
Disability Insurance Trust Fund 
(sec. 40314 of the Senate amendment) 
In Revenue Ruling 2009–13,125 the IRS ruled 
that income recognized under section 72(e) 
on surrender to the life insurance company 
of a life insurance contract with cash value 
is ordinary income. In the case of sale of a 
cash value life insurance contract, the IRS 
ruled that the insured’s (seller’s) basis is re-
duced by the cost of insurance, and the gain 
on sale of the contract is ordinary income to 
the extent of the amount that would be rec-
ognized as ordinary income if the contract 
were surrendered (the ‘‘inside buildup’’), and 
any excess is long-term capital gain. Gain on 
the sale of a term life insurance contract 
(without cash surrender value) is long-term 
capital gain under the ruling. 
PRESENT LAW 
To finance Social Security and Medicare 
benefits, taxes under the Federal Insurance 
Contributions Act (‘‘FICA’’) are imposed on 
employers and employees with respect to 
employee wages.119
Similar taxes are im-
posed under the Self-Employment Contribu-
tions Act (‘‘SECA’’) on self-employed indi-
viduals with respect to their self-employ-
ment income.120 These taxes consist of two 
parts: (1) old-age, survivors, and disability 
insurance (‘‘OASDI’’), which correlates to 
the Social Security program that provides 
monthly benefits after retirement, death or 
disability; and (2) Medicare hospital insur-
ance (‘‘HI’’). 
HOUSE BILL 
No provision. 
PRESENT LAW 
Depreciation and amortization for highways 
and related property 
A taxpayer generally must capitalize the 
cost of property used in a trade or business 
and recover such cost over time through an-
nual deductions for depreciation or amorti-
zation. Tangible property generally is depre-
ciated under the modified accelerated cost 
recovery system (‘‘MACRS’’), which deter-
mines depreciation by applying specific re-
covery periods, placed-in-service conven-
tions, and depreciation methods to the cost 
of various types of depreciable property.112 
The 
alternative 
depreciation 
system 
(‘‘ADS’’) applies with respect to tangible 
property used predominantly outside the 
United States during the taxable year, tax- 
exempt use property, tax-exempt bond fi-
nanced property, and certain other property. 
ADS generally requires the use of the 
straight-line method without regard to sal-
vage value, and requires longer recovery pe-
riods than MACRS. 
Under MACRS, the cost of land improve-
ments (such as roads and fences) is recovered 
over 15 years.113 Land improvements subject 
to ADS are recovered over 20 years using the 
straight-line method.114 
Amortization of intangible property 
The cost recovery of many intangible as-
sets is governed by the rules of section 197. 
In particular, section 197 provides that any 
amortizable section 197 intangible, including 
rights granted by a governmental unit and 
franchise rights, is amortized over a 15–year 
period.115 
Private activity bond financing for highways 
In general, interest on a private activity 
bond that is a qualified bond is excludable 
from taxable income.116 Under present law, a 
private activity bond is not a qualified bond, 
interest on which is tax-exempt, if any por-
tion of the proceeds of the issue of which the 
bond is a part is used to provide any air-
plane, skybox, or other private luxury box, 
health club facility, facility primarily used 
for gambling, or store the principal business 
of which is the sale of alcoholic beverages for 
consumption off premises.117 
SENATE AMENDMENT 
Under the Senate amendment, the fol-
lowing amounts are transferred from the 
General Fund to the OASDI Trust Funds: $27 
million in fiscal year 2012, and $82 million in 
fiscal year 2014. 
Effective date.—The Senate amendment 
provision is effective on the date of enact-
ment. 
HOUSE BILL 
No provision. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT 
The conference agreement does not include 
the Senate amendment provision. 
N. Modify Rules that Apply to Sales of Life 
Insurance Contracts 
(secs. 100112–4 of the Senate amendment and 
new sec. 6050X of the Code) 
SENATE AMENDMENT 
Under this provision, the depreciation for 
applicable leased highway property is deter-
mined under ADS with a statutory 45-year 
recovery period and requirement to use the 
straight-line method. Further, this provision

treat certain amounts as amounts paid by reason of 
the death of an insured (that is, generally, exclud-
able from income). Sec. 101(g). The rules relating to 
accelerated death benefits provide that amounts 
treated as paid by reason of the death of the insured 
include any amount received under a life insurance 
contract on the life of an insured who is a termi-
nally ill individual, or who is a chronically ill indi-
vidual (provided certain requirements are met). For 
this purpose, a terminally ill individual is one who 
has been certified by a physician as having an ill-
ness or physical condition which can reasonably be 
expected to result in death in 24 months or less after 
the date of the certification. A chronically ill indi-
vidual is one who has been certified by a licensed 
health care practitioner within the preceding 12– 
month period as meeting certain ability-related re-
quirements. In the case of a viatical settlement, if 
any portion of the death benefit under a life insur-
ance contract on the life of an insured who is termi-
nally ill or chronically ill is sold to a viatical settle-
ment provider, the amount paid for the sale or as-
signment of that portion is treated as an amount 
paid under the life insurance contract by reason of 
the death of the insured (that is, generally, exclud-
able from income). For this purpose, a viatical set-
tlement provider is a person regularly engaged in 
the trade or business of purchasing, or taking as-
signments of, life insurance contracts on the lives of 
terminally ill or chronically ill individuals (pro-
vided certain requirements are met).

June 28, 2012 
In Revenue Ruling 2009–14,126 the IRS ruled 
that under the transfer for value rules, a por-
tion of the death benefit received by a buyer 
of a life insurance contract on the death of 
the insured is includable as ordinary income. 
The portion is the excess of the death benefit 
over the consideration and other amounts 
(e.g., premiums) paid for the contract. Upon 
sale of the contract by the purchaser of the 
contract, the ruling concludes that the gain 
is long-term capital gain, and in determining 
the gain, the basis of the contract is not re-
duced by the cost of insurance.

crecy Act 129 provide additional guidance re-
garding the disclosure obligation with re-
spect to foreign accounts. 
As part of a series of reforms directed at 
international financing of terrorism,130 the 
Bank Secrecy Act authorizes the Secretary 
of Treasury to impose special measures on 
certain domestic institutions or agencies if, 
after consultation with the Secretary of 
State and the Attorney General, the Sec-
retary of Treasury determines that there are 
reasonable grounds to conclude that a juris-
diction or institution operating outside the 
United States, or accounts or transactions 
involving such jurisdictions or institutions, 
are of primary money laundering concern.131 
In determining whether a particular juris-
diction is of primary money laundering con-
cern, the Secretary considers multiple fac-
tors that may evidence that the jurisdiction 
lacks adequate transparency and may be a 
haven for criminal activities. Evidence that 
groups involved in organized crime, inter-
national terrorism or proliferation of weap-
ons of mass destruction have transacted 
business in that jurisdiction as well as the 
degree of corruption among high-level offi-
cials must be considered. With respect to as-
sessing the fiscal transparency of the juris-
diction, factors include the domestic laws of 
that jurisdiction and their administration; 
the reputation of the jurisdiction as an off-
shore banking haven by credible inter-
national organizations; the extent to which 
the jurisdiction offers regulatory advantages 
to nonresidents; and whether the United 
States has a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty 
(‘‘MLAT’’) with the jurisdiction, and if so, 
experience of U.S. officials in obtaining in-
formation under that agreement. 
In determining whether to apply one or 
more special measure to a particular institu-
tion, or with respect to a type of account or 
transaction, the Secretary considers whether 
the transactions, accounts or institutions fa-
cilitate money laundering through a par-
ticular jurisdiction. The Secretary also 
looks at evidence that organized criminal 
groups or terrorists have been able to avail 
policy number of the contract. Notice of the 
transfer of a life insurance contract to a for-
eign person is intended to include any sort of 
notice, including information provided for 
nontax purposes such as change of address 
notices for purposes of sending statements or 
for other purposes, or information relating 
to loans, premiums, or death benefits with 
respect to the contract. 
The statement the issuer provides to any 
seller or transferor to a foreign person also 
includes the name, address, and phone num-
ber of the issuer’s information contact. 
Reporting with respect to reportable death 
benefits 
When a reportable death benefit is paid 
under a life insurance contract, the payor in-
surance company is required to report infor-
mation about the payment to the IRS and to 
the payee. Under this reporting requirement, 
the payor reports (1) the payor’s name, ad-
dress, and TIN; (2) the name, address, and 
TIN of each recipient of payment; (3) the 
date of each payment; and (4) the amount of 
each payment. A reportable death benefit 
means an amount paid by reason of the 
death of the insured under a life insurance 
contract that has been transferred in a re-
portable policy sale. 
The statement the payor provides to any 
payee also includes the name, address, and 
phone number of the payor’s information 
contact. 
Payment 
For purposes of these reporting require-
ments, payment means the amount of cash 
and the fair market value of any consider-
ation transferred in a reportable policy sale. 
Determination of basis 
The provision provides that in determining 
the basis of a life insurance or annuity con-
tract, no adjustment is made for mortality, 
expense, or other reasonable charges in-
curred under the contract (known as ‘‘cost of 
insurance’’). This reverses the position of the 
IRS in Revenue Ruling 2009–13 that on sale of 
a cash value life insurance contract, the in-
sured’s (seller’s) basis is reduced by the cost 
of insurance. 
Scope of transfer for value rules 
The provision provides that the exceptions 
to the transfer for value rules do not apply 
in the case of a transfer of a life insurance 
contract, or any interest in a life insurance 
contract, in a reportable policy sale. Thus, 
some portion of the death benefit ultimately 
payable under such a contract may be in-
cludable in income. 
Effective date 
Under the provision, the reporting require-
ment is effective for reportable policy sales 
occurring after December 31, 2012, and re-
portable death benefits paid after December 
31, 2012. The clarification of the basis rules 
for life insurance and annuity contracts is 
effective for transactions entered into after 
August 25, 2009. The modification of excep-
tion to the transfer for value rules is effec-
tive for transfers occurring after December 
31, 2012. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT 
The conference agreement does not include 
the Senate amendment provision. 
O. Authorizing Special Measures against 
Foreign Jurisdictions, Financial Institu-
tions, and Others that Significantly Im-
pede U.S. Tax Enforcement 
(sec. 100201 of the Senate amendment and 31 
U.S.C. sec. 5138A) 
SENATE AMENDMENT 
In general 
The provision imposes reporting require-
ments in the case of the purchase of an exist-
ing life insurance contract in a reportable 
policy sale and imposes reporting require-
ments on the payor in the case of the pay-
ment of reportable death benefits. The provi-
sion sets forth rules for determining the 
basis of a life insurance or annuity contract. 
Lastly, the provision modifies the transfer 
for value rules in a transfer of an interest in 
a life insurance contract that is a reportable 
policy sale. 
Reporting requirements for acquisitions of life 
insurance contracts 
Reporting upon acquisition of life insurance 
contract 
The reporting requirement applies to every 
person who acquires a life insurance con-
tract, or any interest in a life insurance con-
tract, in a reportable policy sale during the 
taxable year. A reportable policy sale means 
the acquisition of an interest in a life insur-
ance contract, directly or indirectly, if the 
acquirer has no substantial family, business, 
or financial relationship with the insured 
(apart from the acquirer’s interest in the life 
insurance contract). An indirect acquisition 
includes the acquisition of an interest in a 
partnership, trust, or other entity that holds 
an interest in the life insurance contract. 
Under the reporting requirement, the 
acquiror of the contract reports information 
about the acquisition to the IRS, to the in-
surance company that issued the contract, 
and to the person or persons receiving a pay-
ment. The information reported by the 
acquiror about the acquisition of the con-
tract is (1) the acquiror’s name, address, and 
taxpayer identification number (‘‘TIN’’), (2) 
the name, address, and TIN of each recipient 
of payment in the reportable policy sale, (3) 
the date of the reportable policy sale, (4) the 
name of the issuer and the policy number of 
the life insurance contract, and (5) the 
amount of each payment. 
The statement the acquiror provides to 
any issuer of a life insurance contract is not 
required to include the amount of the pay-
ment or payments for the acquisition of the 
contract. The statement the acquiror pro-
vides to any issuer of a life insurance con-
tract or recipient of a payment in the report-
able policy sale also includes the name, ad-
dress, and phone number of the acquiror’s in-
formation contact. 
Reporting of seller’s basis in the life insurance 
contract 
On receipt of a report described above, or 
on any notice of the transfer of a life insur-
ance contract to a foreign person, each 
issuer is required to report to the IRS and to 
the seller or transferor (1) the basis of the 
contract (i.e., the investment in the contract 
within the meaning of section 72(e)(6)), (2) 
the name, address, and TIN of the seller or 
the transferor to a foreign person, and (3) the 
126 2009–21 I.R.B. 1031.

need to avoid impeding or controlling the export or 
import of monetary instruments and the need to 
avoid burdening unreasonably a person making a 
transaction with a foreign financial agency, the Sec-
retary of the Treasury shall require a resident or 
citizen of the United States or a person in, and doing 
business in, the United States, to keep records, file 
reports, or keep records and file reports, when the 
resident, citizen, or person makes a transaction or 
maintains a relation for any person with a foreign 
financial agency.’’

themselves of such institution, accounts or 
transactions. The extent to which legitimate 
business is conducted through the accounts 
or institutions is also considered. 
The selection of the specific measures is 
made after consultation with other financial 
regulatory agencies and the Secretary of 
State.132 The factors that must be considered 
in selecting which of the measures to invoke 
are enumerated and include U.S. national se-
curity and foreign policy; the cost and bur-
den of compliance with the measures; wheth-
er U.S. financial institutions will be placed 
at a competitive disadvantages as a result; 
the impact of the measure on the inter-
national payment, clearance and settlement 
system; and whether any similar sanction 
has been imposed by another nation or mul-
tilateral group. Increased reporting obliga-
tions with respect to types of transactions or 
accounts involving a foreign jurisdiction, 
mandatory collection of information about 
beneficial ownership of certain types of ac-
counts, and prohibitions against opening or 
maintaining 
payable-through 
or 
cor-
respondent accounts with a nexus to foreign 
jurisdictions are among the measures per-
mitted. These measures may be imposed sep-
arately or in combination. 
Cross-border payment flows are also sub-
ject to reporting obligations for tax pur-
poses.133 Those reporting obligations and re-
lated provisions are commonly referred to as 
FATCA,134 which added new Chapter 4, a re-
porting and withholding regime, to Subtitle 
A of the Code. Chapter 4 requires reporting 
of specific information by third parties for 
certain U.S. accounts held in foreign finan-
cial institutions (‘‘FFIs’’).135 Information re-
porting is encouraged through the with-
holding of tax on payments to FFIs unless 
the FFI enters into and complies with an in-
formation reporting agreement with the Sec-
retary of the Treasury.136 
Access to the foreign-based documents nec-
essary to combat money laundering and tax 
evasion is secured through information ex-
changes with foreign jurisdictions under the 
terms of various treaties and international 
agreements, such as MLAT, tax treaties, or 
tax 
information 
exchange 
agreements 
(‘‘TIEA’’).137 International norms regarding 
fiscal transparency and exchange of informa-
tion for tax administration purposes are re-
flected in the standards developed by the Or-
ganization for Economic Cooperation and 
Development (‘‘OECD’’). The OECD Stand-
ards have been endorsed by the G–20 Min-
SENATE AMENDMENT 
The provision expands the special meas-
ures powers under the Bank Secrecy Act by 
authorizing use of the powers based on a 
finding, made in consultation with the Com-
missioner of the IRS, the Secretary of State 
and the Attorney General, that an institu-
tion, jurisdiction or international trans-
action is significantly impeding tax enforce-
ment. In making such a finding, cooperation 
of an institution or jurisdiction with the im-
plementation of FATCA may be favorably 
considered. The information and consulta-
tions to be considered in making a finding to 
support use of the special measures on the 
basis of either money-laundering or tax en-
forcement concerns are expanded to require 
consideration of U.S. experience with admin-
istrative assistance requests under a tax 
treaty or tax information exchange agree-
ment. Furthermore, a number of conforming 
changes are made to the enumeration of con-
siderations to ensure that factors relevant to 
tax enforcement are considered. 
The process for selection of special meas-
ures to be taken and the considerations for 
their selection remain the same as under 
present law, except for the identity of the 
persons or agencies to be consulted in the 
process when the use of special measures is 
based on a finding that U.S. tax enforcement 
is being significantly impeded. In that case, 
the Secretary of Treasury is required to con-
sult only with the Commissioner of IRS, the 
Secretary of State and the Attorney Gen-
eral. The Secretary of Treasury has sole dis-
cretion whether to consult any other agen-
cies. 
All special measures under present law are 
available for both anti-money-laundering 
and tax enforcement-based findings. The 
ability to prohibit or impose conditions on 
the use of correspondent or payable-through 
accounts is expanded to include the author-
ization, approval or use in the United States 
of a credit card, charge card, debit card or 
other similar financial instrument. 
Effective date.—The provision is effective 
upon date of enactment. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT 
The conference agreement does not include 
the Senate amendment provision. 
P. Delay in Application of Worldwide 
Interest 
(sec. 1801 of the Senate amendment and sec. 
864(f) of the Code) 
is properly attributable to all business ac-
tivities and property of a taxpayer, regard-
less of any specific purpose for incurring an 
obligation on which interest is paid.139 For 
interest allocation purposes, all members of 
an affiliated group of corporations generally 
are treated as a single corporation (the so- 
called ‘‘one-taxpayer rule’’) and allocation 
must be made on the basis of assets rather 
than gross income. The term ‘‘affiliated 
group’’ in this context generally is defined 
by reference to the rules for determining 
whether corporations are eligible to file con-
solidated returns. 
For consolidation purposes, the term ‘‘af-
filiated group’’ means one or more chains of 
includible corporations connected through 
stock ownership with a common parent cor-
poration that is an includible corporation, 
but only if: (1) the common parent owns di-
rectly stock possessing at least 80 percent of 
the total voting power and at least 80 per-
cent of the total value of at least one other 
includible corporation; and (2) stock meeting 
the same voting power and value standards 
with respect to each includible corporation 
(excluding the common parent) is directly 
owned by one or more other includible cor-
porations. 
Generally, the term ‘‘includible corpora-
tion’’ means any domestic corporation ex-
cept certain corporations exempt from tax 
under section 501 (for example, corporations 
organized and operated exclusively for chari-
table or educational purposes), certain life 
insurance companies, corporations electing 
application of the possession tax credit, reg-
ulated investment companies, real estate in-
vestment trusts, and domestic international 
sales corporations. A foreign corporation 
generally is not an includible corporation. 
Subject to exceptions, the consolidated re-
turn and interest allocation definitions of af-
filiation generally are consistent with each 
other. For example, both definitions gen-
erally exclude all foreign corporations from 
the affiliated group. Thus, while debt gen-
erally is considered fungible among the as-
sets of a group of domestic affiliated cor-
porations, the same rules do not apply as be-
tween the domestic and foreign members of a 
group with the same degree of common con-
trol as the domestic affiliated group. 
Banks, savings institutions, and other finan-
cial affiliates 
The affiliated group for interest allocation 
purposes generally excludes what are re-
ferred to in the Treasury regulations as ‘‘fi-
nancial corporations.’’ 140
A financial cor-
poration includes any corporation, otherwise 
a member of the affiliated group for consoli-
dation purposes, that is a financial institu-
tion (described in section 581 or section 591), 
the business of which is predominantly with 
persons other than related persons or their 
customers, and which is required by State or 
Federal law to be operated separately from 
any other entity that is not a financial insti-
tution.141 The category of financial corpora-
tions also includes, to the extent provided in 
regulations, bank holding companies (includ-
ing financial holding companies), subsidi-
aries of banks and bank holding companies 
(including financial holding companies), and 
savings institutions predominantly engaged 
in the active conduct of a banking, financ-
ing, or similar business.142 
A financial corporation is not treated as a 
member of the regular affiliated group for 
purposes of applying the one-taxpayer rule 
to other nonfinancial members of that group. 
PRESENT LAW 
In general 
To compute the foreign tax credit limita-
tion, a taxpayer must determine the amount 
of its taxable income from foreign sources. 
Thus, the taxpayer must allocate and appor-
tion deductions between items of U.S.-source 
gross income, on the one hand, and items of 
foreign-source gross income, on the other. 
In the case of interest expense, the rules 
generally are based on the approach that 
money is fungible and that interest expense 
139 However, exceptions to the fungibility principle 
are provided in particular cases, some of which are 
described below.

135 Under section 1471(c), an FFI must report (1) the 
name, address, and taxpayer identification number 
of each U.S. person or a foreign entity with one or 
more substantial U.S. owners holding an account, (2) 
the account number, (3) the account balance or 
value, and (4) except as provided by the Secretary, 
the gross receipts and gross withdrawals or pay-
ments from the account. 
136 The information reporting requirement under 
the HIRE Act generally applies to payments made 
after December 31, 2012. 
137 TIEAs are entered into by the Administration, 
without the advice and consent of the Senate. In 
contrast to the bilateral tax treaties, TIEAs are gen-
erally limited in scope to mutual exchange of infor-
mation. Since the 1980s, the United States has en-
tered into over 20 such agreements.

CONFERENCE AGREEMENT 
The conference agreement does not include 
the Senate amendment provision. 
PART IV—TAX COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS 
Section 4022(b) of the Internal Revenue 
Service Reform and Restructuring Act of 
1998 (the ‘‘IRS Reform Act’’) requires the 
Joint Committee on Taxation (in consulta-
tion with the Internal Revenue Service and 
the Department of the Treasury) to provide 
a tax complexity analysis. The complexity 
analysis is required for all legislation re-
ported by the Senate Committee on Finance, 
the House Committee on Ways and Means, or 
any committee of conference if the legisla-
tion includes a provision that directly or in-
directly amends the Internal Revenue Code 
(the ‘‘Code’’) and has widespread applica-
bility to individuals or small businesses. 
The staff of the Joint Committee on Tax-
ation has determined that a complexity 
analysis is not required under section 4022(b) 
of the IRS Reform Act because the bill con-
tains no provisions that have ‘‘widespread 
applicability’’ to individuals or small busi-
nesses.

fungibility approach. The rules also provide 
a one-time ‘‘financial institution group’’ 
election that expands the bank group. At the 
election of the common parent of the pre- 
election worldwide affiliated group, the in-
terest expense allocation rules are applied 
separately to a subgroup of the worldwide af-
filiated group that consists of (1) all corpora-
tions that are part of the bank group, and (2) 
all ‘‘financial corporations.’’ For this pur-
pose, a corporation is a financial corporation 
if at least 80 percent of its gross income is fi-
nancial services income (as described in sec-
tion 
904(d)(2)(D)(ii) 
and 
the 
regulations 
thereunder) that is derived from trans-
actions with unrelated persons.147 For these 
purposes, items of income or gain from a 
transaction or series of transactions are dis-
regarded if a principal purpose for the trans-
action or transactions is to qualify any cor-
poration as a financial corporation. 
In addition, anti-abuse rules are provided 
under which certain transfers from one mem-
ber of a financial institution group to a 
member of the worldwide affiliated group 
outside of the financial institution group are 
treated as reducing the amount of indebted-
ness of the separate financial institution 
group. Regulatory authority is provided with 
respect to the election to provide for the di-
rect allocation of interest expense in cir-
cumstances in which such allocation is ap-
propriate to carry out the purposes of these 
rules, to prevent assets or interest expense 
from being taken into account more than 
once, or to address changes in members of 
any group (through acquisitions or other-
wise) treated as affiliated under these rules. 
Effective date of worldwide interest allocation 
The common parent of the domestic affili-
ated group must make the worldwide affili-
ated group election. It must be made for the 
first taxable year beginning after December 
31, 2020, in which a worldwide affiliated 
group exists that includes at least one for-
eign corporation that meets the require-
ments for inclusion in a worldwide affiliated 
group.148 The common parent of the pre-elec-
tion worldwide affiliated group must make 
the election for the first taxable year begin-
ning after December 31, 2020, in which a 
worldwide affiliated group includes a finan-
cial corporation. Once either election is 
made, it applies to the common parent and 
all other members of the worldwide affiliated 
group or to all members of the financial in-
stitution group, as applicable, for the tax-
able year for which the election is made and 
all subsequent taxable years, unless revoked 
with the consent of the Secretary of the 
Treasury. 
HOUSE BILL 
No provision. 
PRESENT LAW 
Defined benefit plans subject to ERISA are 
covered by the Pension Benefit Guaranty 
Corporation (‘‘PBGC’’) insurance program 
and related premium requirements. 
In the case of a single-employer defined 
benefit plan, flat-rate premiums apply at a 
rate of $35.00 per participant for 2012. Single- 
employer flat-rate premium rates are in-
dexed for inflation. 
If a single-employer defined benefit plan 
has unfunded vested benefits, variable-rate 
premiums also apply at a rate of $9 per $1,000 
of unfunded vested benefits divided by the 
number of participants. Variable-rate pre-
miums are not indexed for inflation. For pur-
poses 
of 
determining 
variable-rate 
pre-
miums, unfunded vested benefits are equal to 
the excess (if any) of (1) the plan’s funding 
target for the year, as determined under the 
minimum funding rules, but taking into ac-
count only vested benefits, over (2) the fair 
market value of plan assets. In determining 
the plan’s funding target for this purpose, 
the interest rates used are segment rates de-
termined as under the minimum funding 
rules, but determined on a monthly basis, 
rather than using a 24-month average of cor-
porate bond rates. 
In the case of a multiemployer defined ben-
efit plan, flat-rate premiums apply at a rate 
of $9.00 per participant for 2012. Multiem-
ployer flat-rate premium rates are indexed 
for inflation and are expected to increase to 
$10 for 2013.

Instead, all such financial corporations that

Worldwide interest allocation 
In general 
The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 
(‘‘AJCA’’) 143 modified the interest expense 
allocation rules described above (which gen-
erally apply for purposes of computing the 
foreign tax credit limitation) by providing a 
one-time election (the ‘‘worldwide affiliated 
group election’’) under which the taxable in-
come of the domestic members of an affili-
ated group from sources outside the United 
States generally is determined by allocating 
and apportioning interest expense of the do-
mestic members of a worldwide affiliated 
group on a worldwide-group basis (i.e., as if 
all members of the worldwide group were a 
single corporation). If a group makes this 
election, the taxable income of the domestic 
members of a worldwide affiliated group 
from sources outside the United States is de-
termined by allocating and apportioning the 
third-party interest expense of those domes-
tic members to foreign-source income in an 
amount equal to the excess (if any) of (1) the 
worldwide affiliated group’s worldwide third- 
party interest expense multiplied by the 
ratio that the foreign assets of the worldwide 
affiliated group bears to the total assets of 
the worldwide affiliated group,144 over (2) the 
third-party interest expense incurred by for-
eign members of the group to the extent 
such interest would be allocated to foreign 
sources if the principles of worldwide inter-
est allocation were applied separately to the 
foreign members of the group.145 
For purposes of the new elective rules 
based on worldwide fungibility, the world-
wide affiliated group means all corporations 
in an affiliated group as well as all con-
trolled foreign corporations that, in the ag-
gregate, either directly or indirectly,146 
would be members of such an affiliated group 
if section 1504(b)(3) did not apply (i.e., in 
which at least 80 percent of the vote and 
value of the stock of such corporations is 
owned by one or more other corporations in-
cluded in the affiliated group). Thus, if an af-
filiated group makes this election, the tax-
able income from sources outside the United 
States of domestic group members generally

144 For purposes of determining the assets of the 
worldwide affiliated group, neither stock in corpora-
tions within the group nor indebtedness (including 
receivables) between members of the group is taken 
into account. 
145 Although the interest expense of a foreign sub-
sidiary is taken into account for purposes of allo-
cating the interest expense of the domestic members 
of the electing worldwide affiliated group for foreign 
tax credit limitation purposes, the interest expense 
incurred by a foreign subsidiary is not deductible on 
a U.S. return. 
146 Indirect ownership is determined under the 
rules of section 958(a)(2) or through applying rules 
similar to those of section 958(a)(2) to stock owned 
directly or indirectly by domestic partnerships, 
trusts, or estates.

implementation of the worldwide interest allocation 
rules for two years, until taxable years beginning 
after December 31, 2010; section 15 of the Worker,

Restore Employment Act, Pub. L. No. 111–126, fur-
ther delayed implementation of the worldwide inter-
est allocation rules for three years, until taxable 
years beginning after December 31, 2020.

B. Improvements of PBGC (secs. 40231–40234 
of the conference agreement and ERISA 
sec. 4002, new sec. 4004 and sec. 4005)—Draft 
of 6/27/12, 9:00 PM 
PRESENT LAW 
The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation 
(‘‘PBGC’’), which was created by the Em-
ployee Retirement Income Security Act of 
1974 (‘‘ERISA’’), insures benefits provided 
under defined benefit plans covered by 
ERISA, collects premiums with respect to 
such plans, and manages assets and pays 
benefits with respect to certain terminated 
plans. PBGC’s purposes are to encourage the 
continuation and maintenance of voluntary 
private defined benefit plans, provide timely 
and uninterrupted payment of pension bene-
fits to participants and beneficiaries, and 
maintain premiums at the lowest level con-
sistent with carrying out its obligations 
under ERISA.149 
PBGC is administered by a director, who is 
appointed by the President with the advice 
and consent of the Senate. PBGC’s board of 
directors consists of the Secretary of the 
Treasury, the Secretary of Labor, and the 
Secretary of Commerce, with the Secretary 
of Labor serving as chair. An advisory com-
mittee has been established for the purpose 
of advising the PBGC as to various policies 
and procedures. ERISA contains general pro-
visions as to the board of directors and advi-
sory committee. 
HOUSE BILL 
No provision. 
fies that funds for eligible Title III projects 
under the program must be obligated by the 
end of the following fiscal year but not nec-
essarily initiated. 
Payment-in-lieu of taxes 
The conference report also includes Senate 
language to extend by one year, through fis-
cal year 2013, full funding for the Payment in 
Lieu of Taxes program. The program pro-
vides federal payments to local governments 
to help offset losses in property taxes due to 
nontaxable federal land within their bound-
aries. 
Gulf coast restoration 
The conference report modifies a Senate 
provision related to Gulf Coast restoration 
known as the Resources and Ecosystems 
Sustainability, Tourism Opportunities and 
Revived Economies of the Gulf Coast States 
Act of 2012 (RESTORE Act). The provision 
establishes the Gulf Coast Restoration Trust 
Fund and places in the Trust Fund 80% of all 
civil penalties paid by responsible parties in 
connection with the Deepwater Horizon oil 
spill. Funding may be used to invest in 
projects and activities to restore the long- 
term health of the coastal ecosystem and 
local economies in the Gulf Coast Region, 
which includes the states of Mississippi, Lou-
isiana, Alabama, Florida, and Texas. A por-
tion of the funds will be allocated directly 
and equally to the five Gulf Coast states for 
ecological and economic recovery along the 
coast. A portion will be provided to the Gulf 
Coast Ecosystem Restoration Council estab-
lished by the bill to develop and fund a com-
prehensive plan for the restoration of Gulf 
Coast ecosystems. A portion will be allo-
cated among the states using an impact- 
based formula to implement state plans that 
have been approved by the Council. Finally, 
a portion of the fines will be allocated to a 
Gulf Coast ecosystem restoration, science, 
observation, monitoring and technology pro-
gram and for grants to nongovernmental en-
tities for the establishment of Gulf Coast 
centers of excellence. 
Phased retirement 
SENATE AMENDMENT 
No provision. 
PRESENT LAW 
Under current law, Federal agencies may 
offer part-time employment to retirement- 
eligible workers, but the employee may not 
begin receiving accrued pension benefits. 
Currently, Federal employees face one of 
three choices upon reaching retirement age: 
(1) voluntarily retire and collect an annuity 
based on the pension computation formula, 
(2) continue to work full time, in most cases 
increasing the number of service years used 
in calculating their pension, or (3) volun-
tarily retire and return to Federal employ-
ment as a reemployed annuitant. As a result, 
most experienced Federal employees elect to 
retire. 
Under Internal Revenue Code section 72(t), 
certain distributions from a qualified retire-
ment plan prior to age 591⁄2 are subject to an 
additional tax of 10 percent of the taxable 
amount of the distribution. 
HOUSE BILL 
No provision. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT 
PBGC governance improvement 
The conference agreement expands the 
ERISA provisions relating to the PBGC 
board of directors, advisory committee, di-
rector and other PBGC officials. 
With respect to the board of directors, the 
conference agreement addresses timing and 
procedures for meetings (including a joint 
meeting with the advisory committee). It 
also ensures that the PBGC inspector gen-
eral has direct access to the board, clarifies 
the role of the General Counsel, and provides 
authority to the board to hire its own em-
ployees, experts and consultants as may be 
required to enable the board to perform its 
duties. The conference agreement includes 
specific rules on conflicts of interest with re-
spect to the board of directors and the direc-
tor of PBGC and provides for the PBGC to 
have a risk management officer. It further 
clarifies that the PBGC board of directors is 
ultimately responsible for overseeing PBGC 
and that the director is directly accountable 
to the board of directors and can be removed 
by the board of directors or the president. It 
also sets the director’s term at five years un-
less removed before the expiration of the 
term by the President or the board of direc-
tors. 
The conference agreement states the sense 
of Congress that (1) the board of directors 
should form committees, including an audit 
committee and an investment committee 
composed of at least two members, to en-
149 ERISA sec. 4002(a). 
SENATE AMENDMENT 
The Senate amendment provides the Office 
of Personnel Management the authority to 
establish a phased retirement program for 
qualified Federal employees. The amend-
ment allows Federal employees to retire 
from a portion of their full time employment 
and receive a prorated pension for that serv-
ice. During phased retirement, Federal em-
ployees may work 20 to 80 percent of their 
full-time schedule and continue to receive a 
prorated salary and pension credit for the 
time worked. At least 20 percent of the time 
worked must be used to mentor new employ-
ees. When the phased retiree fully retires, 
hance the overall effectiveness of the board, 
and (2) the advisory committee should pro-
vide the board with policy recommendations 
regarding changes to the law that would be 
beneficial to the PBGC or the voluntary pri-
vate pension system. 
The conference agreement also directs the 
PBGC, not later than 90 days after enact-
ment, to contract with the National Acad-
emy of Public Administration to conduct a 
study of the PBGC to include (1) a review of 
governance structures of organizations (gov-
ernmental and nongovernmental) that are 
analogous to the PBGC and (2) recommenda-
tions with respect to various topics relating 
to the board of directors, such as composi-
tion, procedures, and policies to enhance 
Congressional oversight. The results of the 
study are to be reported within a year of ini-
tiation of the study to the Committee on 
Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions and 
Committee on Finance of the Senate and the 
Committee on Education and the Workforce 
and Committee on Ways and Means of the 
House of Representatives. 
Participant and plan sponsor advocate 
The conference agreement establishes a 
new Participant and Plan Sponsor Advocate. 
The Advocate is chosen by the Board of Di-
rectors from the candidates nominated by 
the advisory committee. This individual will 
act as a liaison between the corporation and 
participants in terminated pension plans. 
The Advocate will ensure that participants 
receive everything they are entitled to under 
the law. The Advocate will also provide plan 
sponsors with assistance in resolving dis-
putes with the corporation. Each year, the 
Advocate will provide a report on their ac-
tivities to the Committee on Health, Edu-
cation, Labor, and Pensions and Committee 
on Finance of the Senate, the Committee on 
Education and the Workforce of the House of 
Representatives, and the Committee on 
Ways and Means of the House of Representa-
tives summarizing the issues raised by par-
ticipants and plan sponsors and making rec-
ommendations for changes to improve the 
system. 
Quality control procedures for the PBGC 
The conference agreement states that the 
PBGC will contract with an outside agency 
(such as the Social Security Administration) 
to conduct an annual review of the Corpora-
tion’s Single-Employer and Multiemployer 
Pension 
Insurance 
Modeling 
Systems 
(‘‘PIMS’’). The first reviews will be initiated 
no later than 3 months after the enactment 
of this Act. 
The conference agreement also states that 
the PBGC will make its own efforts to de-
velop review policies to examine actuarial 
work, management, and record keeping. Fi-
nally, the conference agreement instructs 
the PBGC to provide a specific report ad-
dressing outstanding recommendations made 
by the Office of the Inspector General 
(‘‘OIG’’) relating to the Policy, Research, 
and Analysis Department and the Benefits 
Administration and Payment Department. 
Line of credit repeal 
The conference agreement repeals section 
4005(c) of ERISA, which provides authority 
for the PBGC to issue notes or other obliga-
tions in an amount up to $100,000,000. 
Natural resource provisions 
Secure rural schools 
The conference report includes Senate lan-
guage that extends by one year, through fis-
cal year 2012, the Secure Rural Schools pro-
gram. The program funds county outlays for 
public schools, road improvement and main-
tenance projects, and forest restoration and 
improvement projects in and around Na-
tional Forests. The conference report clari-

ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
PRO TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
BERG). Under clause 8 of rule XX, the 
filing of the conference report on H.R. 
4348 has vitiated the motion to instruct 
conferees offered by the gentlewoman 
from California (Ms. HAHN) which was 
debated yesterday and on which fur-
ther proceedings were postponed. 
f 
RECESS 
CONFERENCE REPORT 
The conference report follows the Senate 
amendment with three changes. First, Postal 
Service employees are exempted from the re-
quirement to spend 20 percent of their time 
mentoring. Second, the provision provides 
that certain law enforcement officers such as 
Customs and Border Protection Officers 
hired before 2008 (when they were granted 
law-enforcement type status which makes 
them ineligible for phased retirement under 
the Senate Amendment because they are 
subject to mandatory retirement) are eligi-
ble for phased retirement. Finally, the con-
ference agreement provides an exception to 
the additional tax under section 72(t) of the 
Internal Revenue Code for distributions from 
federal retirement plans to qualified phased 
retirees. 
Effective Date—The provision is effective on 
the date the implementing regulations are 
issued by the Director of the Office of Per-
sonnel Management. 
Technical correction to the disaster recovery 
FMAP provision 
The ACA included a provision known as 
the ‘disaster-recovery FMAP’ designed to 
help states adjust to drastic changes in 
FMAP following a statewide disaster. Once 
triggered, the policy would provide assist-
ance for as many as seven years following 
the disaster, as long as the state continued 
to experience an FMAP drop of more than 
three percentage points. The Middle Class 
Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 cor-
rected the formula. This policy moves the ef-
fective date to October 1, 2012 and adjusts 
the formula for fiscal year 2013. 
Ocean freight differential 
The United States provides humanitarian 
food aid to developing countries. This assist-
ance is subject to an additional cargo pref-
erence, which requires 75% of food assistance 
be shipped from U.S. flagged vessels. The 
Maritime Administration at the Department 
of Transportation is required to reimburse 
the U.S. agencies that sponsor food aid ship-
ments for the increased costs associated with 
the U.S. flag shipping requirement. This pro-
posal would reduce to 50% the incremental 
ocean freight differential, which would re-
duce the amount of quarterly payments 
made by Maritime Administration at the De-
partment of Transportation. 
Abandoned mine land 
This proposal would cap abandoned mine 
land (AML) reclamation payments to states 
that have completed all high-priority aban-
doned coal mine reclamation projects. Under 
this proposal, payments to those states (cer-
tified states) would be capped at $15 million 
annually. 
Pursuant to the order of the House on April 
25, 2012, the Speaker appointed the following 
conferees from the Committee on Transpor-
tation and Infrastructure for consideration 
of the House bill (except section 141) and the 
Senate amendment (except secs. 1801, 40102,

way through this. These are veteran 
legislators, the chairmen of all of the 
committees here in the Senate. We 
talked a lot about compromise being 
what legislation is all about. Legisla-
tion is the art of compromise, con-
sensus building, but when it comes 
right down to doing that, it is hard for 
Senators to give up what they want. 
But this is a bill that affects almost 3 
million people. That is just the trans-
portation part of it—the flood part, 7 
million people, and the student loan, 7 
million people. So everyone had to give 
a little bit or we could not have gotten 
this done. 
I am terribly disappointed on a part 
of what did not get done. I have always 
been a big fan of the Land and Water 
Conservation Fund. I do not have a bet-
ter friend in the world than Ken Sala-
zar. This is something he wanted so 
very much, but we could not get it 
done. So there is a lot of disappoint-
ment in many different areas. 
But this is legislation at its best. I 
say that purposefully. It is hard to get 
these pieces of legislation done, but we 
got it done. And as I said, we are going 
to work through the process. With the 
Senate being such that it is, people can 
hold measures up, but they cannot hold 
them up forever. So we are going to 
work through this. It is for the better-
ment of our country if we complete 
this legislation as quickly as possible. 
APPOINTMENT OF ACTING 
PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will please read a communication 
to the Senate from the President pro 
tempore (Mr. INOUYE). 
The assistant legislative clerk read 
the following letter: 
U.S. SENATE, 
PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE, 
Washington, DC, June 28, 2012. 
To the Senate: 
Under the provisions of rule I, paragraph 3, 
of the Standing Rules of the Senate, I hereby 
SCHEDULE 
Mr. REID. Mr. President, the next 
hour will be divided between the Re-
publicans and Democrats. The Repub-
licans will control the first half and 
the majority will control the final half. 
It was last night, but just barely, 
when we finally worked out some 
agreement on a piece of legislation we 
are dealing with. The House posted 
that last night just before midnight to 
meet their rules. It includes the trans-
portation conference and flood insur-
ance and student loans in one package. 
I say to all of my Senators that we are 
going to finish this before we leave. I 
hope we can do it today. We certainly 
can if the will is there. Otherwise, if it 
takes tomorrow or whenever, we have 
to finish the bill. I know everyone has 
MEASURE PLACED ON THE CALENDAR—S. 3342 
Mr. REID. Mr. President, S. 3342 is at 
the desk and due for its second reading. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will read the title of 
the bill for the second time.

S4690 
June 28, 2012 
The assistant legislative clerk read 
as follows: 
A bill (S. 3342) to improve information se-
curity, and for other purposes. 
Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would ob-
ject to any further proceedings with re-
spect to this matter at this time. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Objection is heard. The bill will 
be placed on the calendar. 
HEALTH CARE 
Mr. REID. Mr. President, there is a 
lot going on in Washington today. I so 
admire the Supreme Court’s ability to 
keep everything quiet. I mean, it is 
really incredible that we are going to 
have two major decisions this week— 
one dealing with immigration, one 
dealing with health care—and there 
has not been a single word that has 
come out of the Supreme Court. I am 
so impressed. That is the way it has al-
ways been, and I hope it stays that 
way. 
Today the Supreme Court will rule 
on the constitutionality of the land-
mark health reform that made afford-
able, quality care a right for every 
American. Millions of Americans are 
already seeing the benefits of this 
law—I repeat, millions of Americans. 
The Democrats are very proud that we 
stood for the right of every man, 
woman, and child to lifesaving medical 
care instead of standing for insurance 
companies that worry more about 
making money than making people 
better. 
The Supreme Court’s decision, being 
a lawyer myself—I know the Presiding 
Officer was the chief legal officer for 
the State of New Mexico, the attorney 
general—when you are in the area of 
law and are a lawyer, whatever the 
Court does, you accept that. That is 
our form of government. We are a na-
tion of laws, not a nation of men. So 
whatever the Court does, we will work 
through that. If they uphold it, that is 
great. If they do not uphold it, what-
ever it is, we stand ready, willing, and 
able to work to make sure Americans 
have the ability to get health care 
when they are sick. 
I look forward to the opinion coming 
out in the next half hour or so, and we 
will see what that holds. I know that 
will cause a lot of interest here in the 
Senate, but we cannot take our eyes off 
what we have to do today; that is, fig-
ure a way forward on these other mat-
ters with which we have to deal—flood 
insurance, student loans, and the big 
Transportation bill. 
RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Under the previous order, the 
leadership time is reserved. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Under the previous order, the fol-
lowing hour will be equally divided and 
controlled between the two leaders or 
their designees, with the Republicans 
controlling the first half and the ma-
jority controlling the final half. 
The Senator from Wyoming is recog-
nized. 
DEBT AND DEFICIT 
Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I come to 
floor to talk about a bit of a crisis the 
United States is in right now. We are 
out of money, but we are not recog-
nizing that we are out of money. We 
must make that realization soon. We 
are going to have to do some work for 
this country to keep it operating so 
that the next generation has the same 
hope as the present generation. 
I think the best example of where we 
are is probably this highway bill. High-
ways are important to this country. We 
need them to get from one place to an-
other. We need them to move the goods 
across this country to keep the econ-
omy going—highways are extremely 
important. Highways have always been 
funded from a gas tax, until now. Using 
different funding is a prime example of 
what is about to happen in all of the 
bills that we do because we have run 
out of money and we haven’t taken the 
necessary steps to solve that crisis. 
When the highway bill came to the 
Finance Committee, I suggested that 
we ought to change the gas tax so that 
there was an inflationary rate added 
each year for the following year. That 
was the least that I could think of to 
do for highways. It would have added 
half a cent a gallon. The price fluc-
tuates at the pump more than half a 
cent a day. 
I have to tell you, though, that I 
really thought there would be strong 
support for doing something like that, 
taking a minimal step. I had the 
amendment devised so that it could be 
changed 
easily 
to 
increase 
that 
amount. The Simpson-Bowles deficit 
commission said—and this was over a 
year and a half ago—that for the next 
3 years, we needed to raise the gas tax 
5 cents per year for 3 years. So we real-
ly ought to be at 71⁄2 cents or 10 cents 
in increase already. Now, if we did 
that, the highway bill could be funded 
from highway funds. And that is a user 
fee. If you drive, you buy gas. If you 
buy gas, you pay for the highways on 
which you drive. 
I have been talking about this ever 
since we started on the highway bill, 
and I have not had anybody say to me: 
You are wrong, we should not raise the 
gas tax. I was really surprised. I 
thought there would be a huge outcry 
and that I would be in a lot of trouble 
for suggesting a raise in the gas tax. 
But America understands we are broke 
better than Congress understands. 
Both parties told me we would not 
vote on my amendment. And we didn’t 
vote on that amendment in committee, 
and we didn’t vote on that amendment 
on the floor. Of course, by my count, I 
think I had two Democrats supporting 
me and two Republicans supporting 
me, but we didn’t even really get to de-
bate it. We should debate it. We should 
go to the logical spot for highway 
money, the spot that through the his-
tory of highways has been used to fund 
highways. 
So where are we getting the money? 
Well, we did raise the tax on people 
who have pensions, and that is very im-
portant. There is a trust fund—the 
Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation 
has a trust fund to see that if a com-
pany goes out of business and it had 
promised pensions, then the Pension 
Benefit Guaranty Corporation’s trust 
fund makes up part of that. They do 
not make up all of it, but they make it 
part of it. So it is an insurance policy 
for people across America who have 
pensions. And we said: That needs a lit-
tle bit more of a jolt. So we did a cou-
ple of things. One of the things was to 
do some smoothing so companies would 
not have to put quite as much money 
into the fund, and therefore they would 
have maybe more profit, and on the 
profit they would pay taxes, and we 
can steal those taxes to put in the 
highway trust fund so that we can 
build the highways. We have never sto-
len money to pay for highways before. 
Never use the Pension Benefit Guar-
anty trust before. But this bill does 
that. And then there is another little 
bit of money that comes right out of 
the Pension Benefit Guarantee trust 
fund that goes into the highway bill. 
That is the wrong way to do business. 
We should not violate trust funds. 
Wait until the seniors who said 
‘‘don’t touch my Social Security’’ real-
ize that Social Security is a trust fund 
and that we are stealing from trust 
funds. I think we will hear a furor 
across this country that will be un-
matched if Social Security is touched. 
So we are not touching that one—yet. 
We have maxed out our credit cards. 
You know what a maxed-out credit 
card is. That is when you buy some-
thing and the clerk says: I am sorry, 
but there is a hold on your card. When 
you check on it, you find out that you 
have so much debt with that credit 
card company that they are not going 
to let you charge any more. Well, we 
have maxed out a lot of our credit 
cards. We are relying on foreign coun-
tries to help us out with our debt. 
There is a problem in Europe right 
now. The euro is having a real tough 
strain. Eight of the banks that have a 
lot of euros have invested that in U.S. 
bonds because we are the safest place 
in the world. But if those banks col-
lapse, they will need their money. Be-
tween those eight euro banks and the 
four Japanese banks, that is 40 percent 
of the money, almost 40 percent of the 
money we borrow from other countries 
in order to keep our government going. 
We are at $16 trillion worth of debt. 
What is worse, we have quadrupled the 
bottom line on the Federal Reserve. We 
have made money—we have printed 
money to four times the amount of 
money we had 3 years ago. 
We are facing some really difficult 
times, and we are going to have to deed 
up to those. One of those ways would be 
to raise the gas tax and to do the high-
way bill the way the highway bill 
ought to be done. 
Now, I mention these trust funds, and 
I mention them for a very specific rea-
son; that is, they found a trust fund

raise the gas tax. We better take a look 
at what we are doing, and make 
changes. If there is a user fee—and that 
is what the gas tax is—if we use the 
highways, we buy gas; if we buy gas, we 
pay into the trust fund. We should use 
the user fee to pay for highways. We 
have an additional problem that is the 
user fee is probably diminishing be-
cause there are cars that run on elec-
tricity now, and that will probably be 
increasing. Alternative fuels will be in-
creasing, and that will affect how much 
money goes into the trust fund. 
But just to meet the immediate 
needs, there needs to be something 
done, and stealing from other trust 
funds is not the way to do it. If we get 
in the habit of stealing from trust 
funds, Social Security will have to 
watch out. Of course, that will be the 
end of the road for a lot of people in 
this body if they start stealing from 
Social Security. But it ought to be the 
end of the road for people if they are 
stealing from other trust funds because 
it starts the habit, and we can’t afford 
that habit. 
Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unan-
imous 
consent 
the 
order 
for 
the 
quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
The majority leader is recognized. 
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT 
Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am happy, 
I am pleased to see the Supreme Court 
put the rule of law ahead of partisan-
ship and ruled that the affordable care 
act is constitutional. 
This is a long opinion. We know when 
we come back here after the elections 
there may be some work we need to do 
to improve the law, and we will do it 
together. But today millions of Ameri-
cans are already seeing the benefits of 
the law we passed. Seniors are saving 
money 
on 
their 
prescriptions 
and 
checkups, children can no longer be de-
nied insurance because they have a pre-
existing 
condition—protection 
that 
will soon extend to every American. No 
longer will American families be a car 
accident or heart attack away from 
bankruptcy. 
Every Thursday I have a ‘‘Welcome 
to Washington.’’ Today we had a group 
of people from Nevada who have or 
have relatives who have cystic fibrosis. 
It has been so hard for these young 
people to get insurance. It is not going 
to be that way anymore. No longer will 
Americans live in fear of losing their 
health insurance because they lose a 
job. No longer will tens of millions of 
Americans rely on emergency room 
care or go without care entirely be-
cause they have no insurance at all. 
Soon, virtually every man, woman, and 
child in America will have access to 
health insurance they can afford and 
the vital care they need. 
Passing the Affordable Care Act was 
the single greatest step in generations 
toward ensuring access to affordable, 
quality health care for every person in 
America, regardless of where they live 
or how much money they make. 
they could violate. They did it very 
cleverly. They did not mention it to 
anybody who is going to be affected by 
the trust fund. Fortunately, there were 
some diligent people who took a look 
at that highway trust fund bill, and 
they said: Wow, they are going after 
abandoned mine land money in this 
bill. 
That is an abandoned mine land trust 
fund. The money comes from coal that 
is mined, and the money, the tax on 
that coal, is supposed to go to fix aban-
doned mines across the country. The 
conference report’s drafters found $700 
million in that trust fund. That trust 
fund hasn’t maxed out its credit cards 
because, so far, we are still mining coal 
in this country, and so far there is 
money going into it. 
But there are uses for that money 
that need to be achieved. It helps fix 
abandoned mine lands. Another use is 
taking care of orphan miners. I men-
tioned the pension folks before; when 
their company goes out of business, 
they get a little help. Under the aban-
doned mine land trust fund, if a coal 
company goes out of business and the 
miners don’t have any health insurance 
then part of this abandoned mine land 
money goes to make them whole in the 
health insurance area. 
This system was part of a grand coa-
lition that came together to solve some 
problems that are involved with min-
ing in America. The companies and the 
employees and the States that were in-
volved said this probably isn’t the per-
fect solution, but it helps a lot of peo-
ple, so we were going to do it, and we 
did it. We were able to override a point 
of order on the budget in order to 
maintain that trust fund and move the 
money from the trust fund to where it 
was supposed to be used. 
For more than a decade, the money 
wasn’t even taken out of the trust 
fund, and do you know why? Anytime I 
asked about it and said we needed some 
of the money, the government said: Oh, 
I am sorry. You will have to put some 
money in there so we can take the 
money out. I said: What kind of a trust 
fund do you have to put money into 
twice before you can get money out? 
The money already went in there once 
before. Here is how it works. The 
money goes into bonds and the bonds 
go into the drawer and the money gets 
spent. Think about that. Seniors have 
been complaining about the Social Se-
curity trust fund and how we have been 
spending money from the Social Secu-
rity trust fund. They were more clever 
than most people who are involved in 
trust funds because they figured it out. 
The Social Security trust fund has a 
whole bunch of bonds in the drawer. It 
doesn’t have money in the drawer. But 
don’t worry, those bonds are backed by 
the full faith and credit of the United 
States of America, and Europe is about 
to have a huge problem. 
It is kind of interesting. In America, 
every single man, woman, and child 
owes more than $49,000 in national 
debt—and it is growing daily. In one 
meeting I attended, I mentioned that 
figure and somebody said: Can I pay 
my $49,000 and not be responsible for 
the rest of it? I said that is not the way 
it works. Even if we could do that, that 
is not the way it works. So it is $49,000 
for every man, woman, and child in the 
United States. If a child is born today, 
we can tag him or her with a $49,000 
debt immediately. 
Why is that significant? You have 
probably watched Greece and Italy. 
Greece and Italy had to do 19 percent 
cuts. They cut pension plans 19 per-
cent. They cut employees 19 percent. 
They cut the number of employees 19 
percent. They cut the services they 
provide by 19 percent. They cut every-
thing by 19 percent. You probably saw 
there were some riots in their coun-
tries. If we cut 19 percent, there would 
be riots in this country. Here is an in-
teresting fact. In Italy, they only owe 
$40,000 per person. In Greece, they only 
owe $39,000 per person. We owe $49,000 
per person. We are considered to be the 
safest place in the world to put your 
money, and I think that is right—at 
the moment—and it will change if we 
don’t act soon. 
If we keep doing what we are doing in 
the highway trust fund—and it shows 
better there than any other place I can 
think of—we won’t be a secure place to 
invest. The way we are fiddling with 
funds and shuffling credit cards so we 
are not using the maxed-out ones, has 
to stop, my friends. 
With the highway bill before us, the 
conferees did construct a bill so they 
could get quite a few votes on it. They 
put a limit on the amount of money 
certified states could get from the 
abandoned mine land trust fund. It 
doesn’t 
discriminate 
against 
very 
many States. It does discriminate 
against Wyoming, and so I make a plea 
that they not do that and remove the 
section of the bill. Trust fund money 
needs to go for what the trust fund said 
the money would go for. 
Even if they decide to steal from Wy-
oming—and I hope they don’t—but 
even if they do, the money ought to go 
into the other States that are a part of 
the trust fund that need to do mine 
clean up. Over the 10 years of the bill, 
it takes about $715 million worth of 
money from the abandoned mine land 
trust fun—10 years. I did mention 10 
years. 
There is a reason I mentioned 10 
years. This highway bill we are talking 
about doesn’t get all the money from 
all the places we are stealing from in a 
short enough period to pay for the 
highways we are going to build over 
the life of that bill. After the bill ex-
pires and all those things have been 
built, we will still be trying to collect 
the money from the sources it has been 
stolen from in order to pay for what 
has already been built. OK. What hap-
pens when we get to the end of this 
highway bill, and we are still waiting 
for all the places we stole the money 
from to get the money in? Where do we 
steal the next money from? We better

June 28, 2012 
Unfortunately, Republicans in Con-
gress continue to target the rights and 
benefits guaranteed under this law. 
They would like to give the power of 
life and death back to the insurance 
companies. Our Supreme Court has 
spoken. This matter is settled. 
No one thinks this law is perfect. The 
Presiding Officer doesn’t and neither 
do I. Democrats have proven we are 
willing to work with Republicans to 
improve whatever problems exist in 
this law or, in fact, any other law. 
Millions of Americans are struggling 
to find work today, and we know that. 
Our first priority must be to improve 
the economy. It is time for Republicans 
to stop refighting yesterday’s battles. 
Now that this matter is settled, let’s 
move on to other issues such as jobs. 
I note the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. I ask unanimous 
consent that the order for the quorum 
call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Republican leader is recog-
nized. 
died on Saturday, May 12, while serv-
ing in Kandahar Province in Afghani-
stan. He was fatally injured by the det-
onation of an improvised explosive de-
vice. He was 38 years old. 
In the decade that our Nation has 
been at war in Afghanistan, thousands 
of men and women have volunteered to 
serve our country. In order to protect 
others, they put their own lives at risk. 
They leave their homes and their loved 
ones to defend the freedoms we hold 
dear. Nearly 2,000 of them, thus far, 
will not come home. 
Staff Sergeant Nuanes was from Las 
Cruces, NM. He lived most of his adult 
life as a soldier. He was assigned to the 
741st Ordnance Company, 84th Explo-
sive Ordnance Disposal Battalion, 71st 
Ordnance Group. He served two tours of 
duty in Iraq. After returning from Iraq 
in 2010, he enlisted for 6 more years. 
His unit deployed to Afghanistan ear-
lier this year. 
Time and again he answered the call 
of his country. President Kennedy said: 
Stories of past courage . . . can teach, they 
can offer hope, they can provide inspiration. 
But, they cannot supply courage itself. For 
this, each man must look into his own soul. 
In Iraq, in Afghanistan, wherever his 
country needed him, Staff Sergeant 
Nuanes had that courage. Despite the 
danger, despite the risk, he went where 
his country sent him with commit-
ment, with determination, and with an 
unflinching sense of duty. He was 
awarded the Bronze Star and the Pur-
ple Heart. There is sorrow in his death, 
but also inspiration in his life. 
This courageous soldier loved his 
family. He loved his country. He made 
the ultimate sacrifice defending it. He 
leaves behind two children, Israel and 
Laurissa. He has left them far too soon. 
Abraham Lincoln said it best almost 
150 years ago. There is little our words 
can do to add or detract on these sol-
emn occasions. But I offer my deepest 
sympathies to the family of SSG Israel 
Nuanes. We honor his courage, we 
honor his sacrifice, and we mourn your 
loss. 
and what it doesn’t mean, but I can as-
sure you this: Republicans will not let 
up whatsoever in our determination to 
repeal this terrible law and replace it 
with the kind of reforms that will truly 
address the problems it was meant to 
solve. 
Look, we have passed plenty of ter-
rible laws around here that the Court 
finds constitutional. Constitutionality 
was never an argument to keep this 
law in place, and it is certainly not one 
we will hear from Republicans in Con-
gress. There is only one way to truly 
fix ObamaCare—and only one way—and 
that is a full repeal that clears the way 
for commonsense, step-by-step reforms 
that protect Americans’ access to the 
care they need from the doctor they 
choose at a lower cost. That is pre-
cisely what Republicans are committed 
to doing. 
The American people weren’t waiting 
on the Supreme Court to tell them 
whether they supported this law. That 
question was settled 21⁄2 years ago. The 
more the American people have learned 
about this law, the less they have liked 
it. 
Now that the Court has ruled, it is 
time to move beyond the constitu-
tional debate and focus on the primary 
reason this law should be fully repealed 
and replaced—because of the colossal 
damage it has already done to our 
health care system, to the economy, 
and to the job market. 
The Democrat’s health care law has 
made things worse. Americans wanted 
repeal, and that is precisely what we 
intend to do. Americans want us to 
start over, and today’s decision does 
nothing to change that. The Court’s 
ruling doesn’t mark the end of the de-
bate. It marks a fresh start on the road 
to repeal. That has been our goal from 
the start. That is our goal now, and we 
plan to achieve it. The President has 
done nothing to address the problems 
of cost, care, and access. We will. 
I yield the floor. I suggest the ab-
sence a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll.

HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES 
ARMY STAFF SERGEANT ISRAEL NUANES 
Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. 
President, just last month we com-
memorated Memorial Day. Memorial 
Day is a day of remembrance, a day of 
mourning, and a day of gratitude. It is 
a day when Americans from all walks 
of life gather to thank and honor the 
people we have lost, to honor the men 
and women who gave their lives in 
service to our country, and to acknowl-
edge a debt that can never truly be 
paid. 
I rise today to honor Army SSG 
Israel Nuanes. Staff Sergeant Nuanes 
HEALTH CARE RULING 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, 21⁄2 
years ago a Democratic President 
teamed up with a Democratically led 
Congress to force a piece of legislation 
on the American people they never 
asked for and that has turned out to be 
just as disastrous as many of us pre-
dicted. Amid economic recession, a spi-
raling Federal debt, and accelerated in-
creases in government health spending, 
they proposed a bill that made all 
those problems worse. 
Americans 
were 
promised 
lower 
health care costs, and they are going 
up. Americans were promised lower 
premiums, and they are going up. Most 
Americans were promised their taxes 
wouldn’t change, and they are going 
up. Seniors were promised Medicare 
would be protected. It was raided to 
pay for a new entitlement instead. 
Americans were promised it would cre-
ate jobs. The CBO predicts it will lead 
to nearly 1 million fewer jobs. Ameri-
cans were promised they could keep 
their health plans if they liked it. Yet 
millions have learned they can’t. 
The President of the United States 
promised up and down that this bill 
was not a tax. This was one of the 
Democrats’ top selling points because 
they knew it would never have passed 
if they said it was a tax. The Supreme 
Court has spoken. This law is a tax. 
The bill was sold to the American peo-
ple on a deception. It is not just that 
the promises about this law weren’t 
kept; it is that it made the problems it 
was meant to solve even worse. The 
supposed cure has proven to be worse 
than the disease. 
So the pundits will talk a lot about 
what they think today’s ruling means 
HEALTH CARE 
Mr. President, we have all heard the 
historic ruling on the Affordable Care 
Act today. I know the Presiding Officer 
has been following this closely. We all 
have been following this closely. The 
Supreme Court has upheld the Afford-
able Care Act. 
The Affordable Care Act has moved 
us forward, but now the call on the Re-
publican side is for full repeal of the 
law. So it seems their legislative objec-
tive is going to be to introduce a piece 
of legislation—and we will have a vote 
on the Senate floor—for full repeal. I 
wish to remind New Mexicans in par-
ticular what is at stake when we talk 
about full repeal. 
First of all, insurance companies 
today, with the Affordable Care Act in 
place, cannot deny coverage if a person 
has a preexisting condition. That is 
something that is tremendously impor-
tant to New Mexicans. If someone has 
a young child who has cancer and they

have to get insurance, they can’t deny 
them because of a preexisting condi-
tion. 
There is no doubt that we can im-
prove upon the law, but New Mexico 
has already received more than $200 
million in grants and loans to establish 
an 
insurance 
exchange, 
strengthen 
community health centers, train new 
health professionals, and so much 
more. 
Since passing the law, more than 
26,000 young adults under 26 years old 
have been allowed to stay on their par-
ents’ insurance plans. Almost 20,000 
New Mexico seniors on Medicare re-
ceived a rebate to help cover prescrip-
tion costs when they hit the doughnut 
hole in 2010. And 285,000 New Mexicans 
with 
private 
health 
insurance 
no 
longer have to pay a deductible or 
copay for preventive health care such 
as physicals, cancer screenings, and 
vaccinations. More is yet to come 
under the Affordable Care Act. 
So this is the contrast: There are 
some who are calling for full repeal; 
there are others of us who recognize 
that there are significant accomplish-
ments, and we want to work further 
with the other side in a bipartisan way 
to put aside partisanship and move for-
ward with improving our health care 
system. 
I note the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The assistant legislative clerk pro-
ceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
HEALTH CARE DECISION 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, this 
morning’s decision by the Supreme 
Court has clarified some things and has 
made other things more muddled. One, 
it has clarified the importance of the 
upcoming election on November 6, 2012. 
The only way to stop the overreaching 
by the Federal Government, including 
the President’s flawed health care bill, 
is to elect a new President and a Con-
gress that will repeal and replace this 
fundamentally flawed law. 
Before the health care bill became 
law, the President repeatedly assured 
the American people he would not raise 
taxes on the middle class. He declared 
emphatically that the individual man-
date was ‘‘absolutely not a tax in-
crease.’’ But the Supreme Court has 
made absolutely clear the only way 
ObamaCare can be upheld as within the 
constitutional power of Congress is for 
it to be considered a tax increase, and 
a tax increase on every single Amer-
ican, regardless of income. 
The President told us his health care 
law would reduce premiums by $2,500 
for the average family. That was an-
other broken promise. Last year, the 
average American family, with em-
ployer-sponsored insurance, saw their 
premiums rise by $1,200. 
The case against this health care leg-
islation is very simple: It relies on 
put a new President in the White 
House. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
HAGAN). The Senator from Iowa. 
Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, as 
chair of the Health, Education, Labor, 
and Pensions Committee in the Sen-
ate—the committee that drafted large 
portions of the Affordable Care Act—in 
looking back at all of the hearings we 
had, the long markup sessions, working 
across the aisle with Republicans, 
working with the administration, fi-
nally getting it passed and signed into 
law, this is a great day. 
There has been a cloud hanging over 
this because of those who didn’t want 
to reform the health care system. They 
wanted to keep insurance companies in 
charge. Well, we said, no, we are going 
to change this; we are going to reform 
the system and make it work for peo-
ple, not just for insurance companies. 
There are those out there who didn’t 
want to change, who didn’t want to re-
form the system, and so they brought 
cases to court. And as we know, this 
issue has wound its way through the 
courts—some deciding yes and some de-
ciding no—and then went to the Su-
preme Court. 
I remember being in the Court this 
spring for the arguments on this law, 
and we have been waiting since for the 
Supreme Court to make its decision. 
Well, this morning, the Supreme Court 
gave a resounding confirmation that 
the Affordable Care Act is indeed con-
stitutional. 
Some have been saying President 
Obama wins this or the Democrats win 
or the Republicans lose—that kind of 
thing. I don’t see it that way. What I 
see is that this is a great victory for 
the American people, for the businesses 
of America, and for our economy. That 
is what this is all about. It moves us 
forward so that every American—every 
single American—will have quality, af-
fordable health care coverage—some-
thing we have never done in this coun-
try. That is why this is such a land-
mark bill and such a landmark decision 
by the Supreme Court. 
The Supreme Court’s decision allows 
us to move ahead and replaces what I 
have often called a sick-care system— 
a system that will maybe get to you, if 
you are lucky, in the emergency room 
if you are sick, but not one that gets to 
you before that to keep you healthy. 
That is what the Affordable Care Act is 
moving toward—a system of more pre-
ventive health care, more promoting of 
wellness and keeping people healthy in 
the first place by giving them the cov-
erage they can use to access affordable 
wellness and preventive health care. 
The Supreme Court has made it clear 
what we have known all along, that 
those who want to block this law and 
who are now clamoring to repeal it are 
on the wrong side of this issue. They 
are on the wrong side of history. We 
can go all the way back to those who 
didn’t want to have a Social Security 
System. They were on the wrong side 
massive tax increases, job-killing regu-
lations, and government coercion. It 
will place Washington bureaucrats be-
tween patients and their doctors and it 
will cause millions of Americans to 
lose their current insurance coverage. 
So much for ‘‘if you like it, you can 
keep it.’’ And as we now know, 
ObamaCare has made the problem of 
rising health care costs worse, not bet-
ter. 
For these reasons and more, we need 
to repeal this entire piece of legislation 
and start over. We all share the goal of 
expanding health care coverage, but 
there are good ways and bad ways to do 
it. The authors of ObamaCare chose a 
fundamentally flawed way: Yet another 
government takeover. 
Perhaps one of the most telling 
things Congress has done in the last 2 
years is pass a bill under Medicare for 
prescription drug coverage for seniors. 
Rather than a government-run pro-
gram, we created a marketplace for 
competition, where prescription pro-
viders can compete for consumers’ 
favor by improved or lower cost and 
better service. Indeed, by using the 
cost discipline of a consumer-oriented 
approach to health care, that govern-
ment program came in 40 percent under 
projected cost. That is the only time I 
know of in the health care field where 
the government has actually created a 
program that people like and that has 
come in significantly under cost. 
We cannot continue to cut health 
care payments to providers because, 
quite simply, fewer and fewer providers 
are going to provide that service. We 
know that is true in Medicare, where 
many seniors can’t find a doctor to 
take them as a patient because pro-
viders won’t accept Medicare’s low re-
imbursement rates. We know it is even 
worse for Medicaid patients, because 
that government program pays pro-
viders a fraction of what they would be 
paid if they were simply covered by pri-
vate insurance. 
All Americans should have access to 
high-quality coverage and high-quality 
care. The best way to make quality 
coverage and care more accessible is to 
reduce the cost. ObamaCare increases 
the cost. We need to reduce the cost 
and make it more affordable, and the 
best way to reduce cost is through pa-
tient-driven 
reforms 
that 
increase 
transparency, 
eliminate 
government 
distortions, and boost private competi-
tion. Those are the reforms Americans 
want, and those are the reforms they 
deserve. 
Unfortunately, President Obama has 
made clear he views health care reform 
as a vehicle for expanding the size of 
government and its intrusion into the 
decisions that should be reserved for 
patients in consultation with their pri-
vate doctors. 
Time and time again the President 
has put ideology ahead of basic logic 
and sound economics. Therefore, to en-
sure future health care reforms em-
power patients and reduce cost and 
make it more affordable, we need to

of history. There were those who didn’t 
want to have a Medicare system. They 
were on the wrong side of history. And 
those who want to repeal this law can 
stand with them. They can stand with 
them in history. 
But I think history has shown that 
every time we expand the rights of peo-
ple to certain basic needs in people’s 
lives, we become a stronger country, a 
more unified country, a better country, 
with more opportunity for all. 
For those of us who believe that 
quality, affordable health care is a 
right and not a privilege, this is a great 
victory. 
I see that some in the House have 
scheduled a vote to repeal it after we 
get back from the Fourth of July 
break. They have already voted to re-
peal it; I guess they are going to vote 
to repeal it again. They are on the 
wrong side of history. I call upon my 
Republican friends in the House and 
the Senate: It is over. This is constitu-
tional. Now let’s work together to 
make it so that it is implemented and 
that it works for everyone. 
I say to my Republican friends that I 
have never said the Affordable Care 
Act is like the Ten Commandments, 
chiseled in stone for all eternity. I have 
often likened it to a starter home to 
which we could make some additions 
and some improvements as we go 
along. But at least that starter home 
has put a roof over our heads—a roof 
that will give quality affordable health 
care insurance to every American. So I 
say to my Republican friends, bring 
your toolkits if you want to make it 
better and improve it. Bring your tool-
kits, don’t bring a sledgehammer. 
Don’t bring a sledgehammer to break it 
down and try to repeal it. So let’s work 
together, put politics behind us, and 
make this bill work for everyone, make 
it work for every American. The Jus-
tices have spoken. Now it is time for us 
to get back to work to build a reformed 
health care system that works not just 
for the healthy and the wealthy but for 
all Americans. 
This is a victory. It is not a victory 
for President Obama. It is not a victory 
for my committee or anyone else 
around here. This is a victory to make 
sure that no one—no one in the future 
is ever denied health care coverage be-
cause he or she got cancer, to make 
sure that no one in the future will be 
denied quality affordable health care 
coverage because they have diabetes. 
It is a victory for families who have 
had a child who needed intensive, very 
expensive health care coverage to 
make sure that child would live and 
grow and be able to take full part in 
our society, although sometimes those 
costs are extremely high. In the past, 
there have been annual limits, and if 
you went above that, you had to pay 
out of pocket. There were lifetime 
caps. How many women have I met in 
the past who have had breast cancer 
and had to have intensive treatments 
for a period of time but they bumped 
up against a lifetime cap. They had to 
pay out of their pocket. So this is a 
victory for them. It is a victory for 
families so that they don’t face life-
time caps and annual caps. It is a vic-
tory for every family in America to en-
sure that their child can stay on their 
family’s policy until age 26. That is 
who wins here—ordinary hard-working 
families in America. It is a victory for 
hard-working families to make sure 
that insurance companies have to pro-
vide—have to provide—cost-effective, 
lifesaving preventive care at no cost to 
get to people early on to keep them 
healthy in the first place. It is a vic-
tory for working families so no longer 
do they have to choose between paying 
for health insurance or other critical 
family needs such as food, shelter, 
transportation, 
education. 
That 
is 
what this is about. That is what this 
victory is all about. It is a victory for 
American families. 
I say to those who now want to re-
peal it, who are going to start to make 
a political issue out of this, you are on 
the wrong side of history. The Amer-
ican people will now begin to take a 
look at this bill in a new light: that it 
is constitutional, it will be imple-
mented, and what is in it for us? And I 
just went through what is in it for 
every American family. The American 
people will not want to go back. They 
will not want to repeal this law. There 
may be improvements we can make as 
we go along. That is fine. But I say woe 
to those who vote to repeal this bill. 
The American people will hold you ac-
countable for being on the wrong side 
of history, the wrong side of progress, 
the wrong side of ensuring that every 
American family has quality affordable 
health care in America. 
Madam President, I yield the floor, 
and I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent the order for the 
quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I 
come to the floor, as many of our col-
leagues have done, to talk about this 
very significant and, for me at least, 
stunning U.S. Supreme Court decision 
on ObamaCare. First of all, I use the 
word ‘‘stunning,’’ not particularly be-
cause of the outcome. I would not have 
been shocked at either outcome—up-
holding the law or striking down the 
law. I considered both of those clear 
possibilities. 
I 
am 
stunned 
and 
shocked, somewhat confused, by the 
decision—by the nature of the decision, 
by the nature of the majority, and by 
the reasoning. 
I am not going to dwell on that. It is 
not my role or the role of other Sen-
ators to second-guess it or to claim we 
have some authority to rewrite it. But 
I do find that doing backflips beyond 
the significant power of the Court to 
completely recharacterize the indi-
vidual mandate and parts of the law as-
sociated with it as a tax—it was never 
proposed as a tax. It was never debated 
as a tax. It was never written as a tax. 
It was never meant as a tax in any part 
of the ObamaCare debate or legislative 
action. So I certainly agree with Jus-
tice Kennedy who said out loud from 
the bench, which I think is significant, 
that to read it ‘‘as a tax’’ is not just 
reading the law a certain way, it is re-
writing the law. Judicial rewriting of 
tax policy, judicial writing of the law 
to create a tax, is particularly worri-
some. I absolutely agree with that. 
I do think the majority, led trag-
ically by Chief Justice Roberts, did 
backflips to rewrite the law in order to 
uphold it. I think that is very unfortu-
nate. 
What it also means for the country 
and for the policy debate and for us in 
the Congress is at least two things, 
which I think are also very important. 
No. 1, it means that if this is a tax, this 
is a massive tax increase on the middle 
class, which stands full square against 
the clear and repeated campaign prom-
ises of President Obama. So this is a 
huge tax increase, now that it is a tax, 
completely against everything he ran 
on and what he said over and over, 
campaigning for office. 
It also means something separate 
that is very significant. If this is all 
about taxes and spending, it means a 
different Congress next year—hope-
fully, led by a different President—can 
repeal all of that with a simple major-
ity of votes in the Senate through rec-
onciliation. If this is all about taxes 
and spending, then it can all be undone 
through the reconciliation process. Of 
course, that is significant for one rea-
son and one reason only: In the Senate, 
it means that lowers the requirement 
from 60 votes to a simple majority. If 
there is a Republican President, that 
would be 50 votes, plus the Vice Presi-
dent as the tiebreaker. 
So my bottom line is simple. It was 
my bottom line yesterday before the 
opinion, it was my bottom line over 
the last several months, and it was my 
bottom line the day after Congress 
passed ObamaCare and the President 
signed it into law. It may be ruled con-
stitutional, but it is still a bad idea 
that is making things worse. It is put-
ting an all-powerful Federal Govern-
ment between the patient and his or 
her doctor, and it is costing us an enor-
mous amount of money as individuals, 
as citizens, as a society, and as a gov-
ernment that we clearly cannot afford. 
Many of us made those arguments 
during the original debate. But I think 
all of those arguments have been vali-
dated and are even more clearly true 
and compelling in the months since 
ObamaCare was passed, in particular, 
because costs have been going through 
the roof. The suggestion that this was 
going to save us money and not cost us 
extra money—even the suggestion of 
that argument—has gone out the win-
dow. It is clear the opposite is true. In-
dividual premiums have gone up as a

June 28, 2012 
health care law that has divided the 
American people and failed to address 
rising 
health 
care 
costs. 
Congress 
should work together to make com-
monsense, step-by-step health reforms 
that can truly lower the cost of health 
care. I was pleased to see that the Su-
preme Court narrowed the Medicaid ex-
pansion because States can’t afford 
them. Hard-working Americans are 
still struggling in this anemic economy 
and need real action to make health 
care more affordable. 
Reforms do not have to start here in 
Washington. Our Nation’s States are 
laboratories of democracy and can play 
a significant role in addressing the 
health care crisis in America. Gov-
ernors are in a special position to un-
derstand the unique problems facing 
their States, and fixing health care, 
like most problems facing our Nation, 
cannot be a one-size-fits-all solution. 
Efforts underway by Indiana Governor 
Mitch Daniels provide a great example 
of what different States are working 
on. He is moving forward with the 
Healthy Indiana initiative, which is an 
affordable insurance program for unin-
sured State adults aged 19 to 64. 
Outside Washington, some health in-
surance companies have already stated 
they will adopt several reasonable pro-
visions to lower health care costs. 
These include allowing young adults to 
be covered until age 26 while on their 
parent’s plan, not charging patients 
copays for certain care, not imposing 
lifetime limits, and not implementing 
retroactive cancellation of health care 
coverage. They said they would do that 
regardless of how the Supreme Court 
case came out. 
One of the most effective ways Con-
gress can address the rising costs of 
health care is to focus on the way it is 
delivered as part of the Nation’s cur-
rent cost-driven and ineffective patient 
care system. America’s broken fee-for- 
service structure is driving our Na-
tion’s health care system further down-
ward, and tackling this issue is a good 
start to reining in rising health care 
costs. What is fee for service? This 
method of payment encourages pro-
viders to see as many patients and pre-
scribe as many treatments as possible 
but does nothing to reward providers 
who help keep patients healthy. These 
misaligned incentives drive up costs 
and hurt patient care. 
The new health care law championed 
by President Obama and congressional 
Democrats did very little to address 
these problems. The legislation instead 
relied on a massive expansion of 
unsustainable government price con-
trols found in fee-for-service Medicare. 
If we want to address the threat posed 
by out-of-control entitlement spend-
ing, we need to restructure Medicare to 
better align incentives for providers 
and beneficiaries. This will not only 
lower health care costs, it will also im-
prove the quality of care for millions of 
Americans. In the health care bill, we 
took $500 billion out of Medicare and 
put it into new programs. Then we ap-
pointed an unelected board to suggest 
result, family premiums have gone up 
as a result, and costs to the govern-
ment and to society have gone up as a 
result. It has made the already stag-
gering problem of health care costs 
worse and worse. It has made health 
care for everyday Americans less and 
less affordable. Because of that, I cer-
tainly renew my commitment to work 
with others to fully repeal ObamaCare 
lock, stock, and barrel. 
Under the Supreme Court’s decision 
today, I restate again that I think it is 
very significant since it is all about a 
tax and all about taxes and spending 
that can be addressed early next year 
with a simple majority in the Senate if 
there is a President Romney and a Re-
publican Congress to do it. 
I thank the Chair. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam Presi-
dent, I ask unanimous consent that the 
order for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam Presi-
dent, in light of the Supreme Court’s 
decision on the Affordable Care Act, I 
wanted to come to the floor today to 
bring just a few Rhode Island voices 
into the discussion that is taking 
place. 
One such person is a man from Provi-
dence, RI, named Greg, who has a 16- 
year-old son named Will. Will has cys-
tic fibrosis, which requires Will to 
spend several hours every day under-
going the treatment that dreadful dis-
ease requires. He sees a specialist four 
times a year to monitor the disease. He 
has daily prescriptions and treatments. 
Without this bill, Will and his father 
were looking at two problems: One, de-
nial of coverage because Will’s cystic 
fibrosis was a preexisting condition; 
and, two, lifetime caps. 
For people like Will all around the 
country, this has been a real blessing 
because lifetime caps are forbidden and 
kids with preexisting conditions must 
be covered notwithstanding the pre-
existing condition. So for Greg, the fa-
ther in Providence, and his son Will, I 
want their voices to be heard today in 
not so much celebration but relief that 
what they have been provided by the 
health care law is still in place. 
Another voice to bring to the Senate 
floor is Olive. Olive is a senior citizen. 
She lives in Woonsocket, RI. Her hus-
band has fairly serious Alzheimer’s and 
requires several medications to treat 
it. Until the Affordable Care Act came 
along, Olive and her husband fell in the 
doughnut hole and had to pay 100 cents 
on the dollar for the husband’s Alz-
heimer’s medications while they were 
in the doughnut hole. 
When I ran for this office, one of the 
things I pledged to do was to work my 
heart out to close the doughnut hole. 
In the Affordable Care Act, it does 
close. Right now there is a 50-percent 
discount for Olive on her husband’s 
Alzheimer’s drugs when they are in the 
doughnut hole. For them that 50-per-
cent discount means $2,400, which, for 
senior citizens who count on Social Se-
curity in Woonsocket, makes a dif-
ference in the quality of their lives. 
Overall, it is up to $13.9 billion in 
doughnut hole discounts for seniors 
and people with disabilities as a result 
of this bill. That makes a big difference 
in every single one of those lives, just 
like Olive and her husband. 
A third voice I wish to bring to the 
Senate is Brianne, who is a 22-year-old 
graduate of the University of Rhode Is-
land, out and working part time as a 
physical therapist, but her job does not 
provide health insurance. She would be 
going without entirely, hanging her 
fortunes on chance, as the President 
recently said, if it were not for the Af-
fordable Care Act. She and 9,000 young 
adults in Rhode Island have achieved 
coverage as a result of this bill by 
being able to get on their parents’ poli-
cies. 
Danny is also a recent college grad-
uate living in Providence, having grad-
uated from Brown University. He is 
passionate 
about 
renewable 
energy 
planning but couldn’t make the health 
insurance work. Because of the Afford-
able Care Act, like Brianne, he is able 
to be on his parents’ health insurance 
coverage and have that peace of mind. 
The last story I will tell is about a 
small business owner named Geoff in 
Providence who provides health care 
insurance for his employees because he 
believes it is the right thing to do. He 
qualified for the law’s small business 
health care tax credit, so he has seen a 
significant advantage to his small busi-
ness from this provision. 
I think it is a relief to put this quar-
rel behind us, to be able to move on 
and deal with the economic issues we 
face. As we do, I wish to make sure 
that Greg and Olive and Brianne and 
Geoff and Danny were all heard here on 
the floor today, because they are 
Rhode Islanders in whose lives this bill 
has made a real and practical dif-
ference. 
I thank the Presiding Officer. 
I yield the floor. I see the distin-
guished Senator from Wyoming ready 
to speak. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wyoming. 
Mr. ENZI. Madam President, it is dis-
appointing that the Supreme Court has 
upheld the constitutionality of the new 
health care law. Just because it is con-
stitutional doesn’t mean it is the best 
policy, the perfect policy, or even good 
policy. And just because the Court 
upheld the law does not change the fact 
that the American people have over-
whelming concerns about it—not all of 
it but a lot of it. 
In fact, the Court affirmed that the 
new health care law is a massive tax 
increase on the American people. Con-
gress must get serious about fixing our 
broken health care system. We can 
start 
by 
changing 
this 
misguided

cuts that can be made, and the only 
place left for cuts are providers, hos-
pitals, 
home 
health 
care, 
nursing 
homes, and hospice care. I don’t think 
that is where we want to be cutting 
Medicare. 
Shifting the health care delivery sys-
tem from one that pays and delivers 
services based on volume to one that 
pays and delivers services based on 
value is an idea that unites both Re-
publicans and Democrats. We have 
been mentioning a number of simple 
steps that can be taken while Congress 
weighs the larger fixes needed for pre-
ventive care. We can encourage insur-
ers to offer plans that focus on deliv-
ering health care services by reducing 
copays for high-value services and in-
creasing copays for low-value or exces-
sive services. Consumer-directed health 
plans provide another avenue for link-
ing financial and delivery system in-
centives and have the potential to re-
duce health care spending by $57 billion 
a year. Bundled payments will support 
more efficient and integrated care. All 
of these options have already been uti-
lized by a number of private sector 
firms with great success. The Federal 
Government should be willing to sup-
port viable reforms where it is needed, 
but also refrain from handcuffing inno-
vative private sector designs with ex-
cessive regulations or narrow political 
interests. 
Our Nation has made great strides in 
improving the quality of life for all 
Americans, and we need to remember 
that every major legislative issue that 
has helped transform our country was 
forged in the spirit of compromise and 
cooperation. These qualities are essen-
tial to the success and longevity of cru-
cial programs such as Medicare and 
Medicaid. But when it comes to health 
care decisions being made in Wash-
ington lately, the only thing the gov-
ernment is doing is increasing par-
tisanship and legislative gridlock. I 
wish to leave the Senate with some 
words of wisdom from one of our de-
parted Members, and that is Senator 
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a Democrat 
from New York, who served in this 
body. He said in 2001, shortly before he 
retired: 
Never pass major legislation that affects 
most Americans without real bipartisan sup-
port. It opens the door to all kinds of polit-
ical trouble. 
Senator Moynihan correctly noted 
that the party that didn’t vote for it 
will criticize the resulting program 
whenever things go wrong. More impor-
tantly, he predicted the measure’s very 
legitimacy will be constantly ques-
tioned by a large segment of the popu-
lation who will never accept it unless 
it is shown to be a huge success. 
That is a quote from Daniel Patrick 
Moynihan, former Senator. 
Truer words were never spoken. We 
have seen each of these scenarios play 
out over the past 2 years as the new 
health care law polarized the Nation. I 
hope this distinguished body has the 
courage to learn from our mistakes, be-
cause our Nation needs health care re-
form, but it has to be done the right 
way. Providing Americans with access 
to high-quality affordable health care 
is something I am confident Democrats 
and Republicans should be able to 
agree on. 
Two-and-a-half years ago, a Demo-
cratic President teamed up with a 
Democratic-led 
Congress 
with 
only 
Democratic votes to force a piece of 
legislation on the American people 
that they never asked for and that has 
turned out to be as disastrous as pre-
dicted. How so? Amid an economic re-
cession, a spiraling Federal debt, and 
accelerating increases in government 
health spending, they proposed a bill 
that has made the problems worse. 
Americans 
were 
promised 
lower 
health care costs. They are going up. 
Americans were promised lower pre-
miums. They are going up. Most Amer-
icans 
were 
promised 
their 
taxes 
wouldn’t change. They are going up. 
Seniors were promised Medicare would 
be protected. It was raided to pay for a 
new entitlement instead. Americans 
were promised it would create jobs. 
The CBO predicts it will lead to nearly 
1 million fewer jobs. Americans were 
promised they can keep their plan if 
they liked it, yet millions have learned 
that they can’t. And the President of 
the United States himself promised up 
and down that this bill was not a tax. 
That was one of the Democrats’ top 
selling points, because they knew it 
would never get passed if they said it 
was a tax. The Supreme Court spoke 
today. It said it is a tax. 
This law was sold to the American 
people under deception. But it is not 
just that the promises about this law 
were not kept, it is that it has made 
the problems it was meant to solve 
even worse. The supposed cure has 
proved to be worse than the disease. 
We pass plenty of terrible laws 
around here that the Court finds con-
stitutional. We need to do some com-
monsense, step-by-step reforms that 
protect Americans’ access to the care 
they 
need, 
from 
the 
doctor 
they 
choose, and at a lower cost. That is 
precisely what I am committed to 
doing. 
The American people weren’t waiting 
on the Supreme Court to tell them 
whether they supported this law. That 
question was settled 21⁄2 years ago. The 
more the American people have learned 
about this law, the less they have liked 
it. 
Now that the Court has ruled, it is 
time to move beyond the constitu-
tional debate and focus on the primary 
flaws of this law because of the colossal 
damage it is doing and has already 
done to the health care system and to 
the economy and to the job market, 
which needs to be turned around. There 
are things that need to be done and can 
be done. 
I yield the floor and suggest the ab-
sence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
MCCASKILL). Without objection, it is so 
ordered. 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent to speak as in 
morning business. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I 
cannot remember another day when so 
many Americans were waiting for the 
Supreme Court to rule, but today was 
one of those days all across America. 
Everyone understood that a decision 
just across the street this morning by 
the nine members of the Supreme 
Court was historic and politically sig-
nificant. 
The Supreme Court handed down a 
decision, consisting of 193 pages, with 
all of the major opinions—dissenting 
and concurring opinions included—in 
the case of National Federation of 
Independent Business v. Sebelius. We 
knew this was a case to decide the con-
stitutionality of the Affordable Care 
Act. That, of course, was one of Presi-
dent Obama’s first major legislative 
undertakings when he was elected 
President. Many of us who were part of 
the Senate and the House during this 
debate will never forget it. I have been 
lucky enough to represent my great 
State of Illinois for quite some time, in 
both the House and Senate, but there 
has never been a more historic and ex-
hausting debate than the one that pre-
ceded the final vote on the Affordable 
Care Act. The last vote in the Senate 
actually occurred on Christmas Eve, 
and then we hurried away from here to 
be with our families, knowing we had 
done something of great historic im-
port. 
Behind this decision was my human 
experience that most every one of us 
has had at one time or another. I can 
recall in my own family experience 
that moment when I was a brandnew 
dad and a law student—not exactly a 
great combination in planning, but 
that was my life. Our daughter was 
born with a serious problem. We were 
here in Washington, DC, and we were 
uninsured—no 
health 
insurance, 
a 
brandnew baby, and I was a law stu-
dent. I can remember leaving George-
town Law School a few blocks from 
here to go over to Children’s Memorial 
Hospital to sit in a room with all of the 
other parents who had no health insur-
ance. It was a humbling experience, 
waiting for your number to be called 
for a brandnew doctor whom you had 
never seen before to sit down and ask 
you again for the 100th time the his-
tory of your child. You never feel more 
helpless as a parent in that cir-
cumstance—to have no health insur-
ance and to hope and pray you are still 
doing the best for your child. That ex-
perience is one that literally millions 
of Americans have every single day,

with no health insurance, praying that 
they will get through the day without 
an accident, a diagnosis, or something 
that is going to require medical care. 
What we tried to do with the Afford-
able Care Act was twofold: first, to ex-
pand the reach of health insurance cov-
erage to more families; second, to 
make health insurance itself more af-
fordable and more reasonable. 
Let me start with this question of af-
fordable and reasonable health insur-
ance. Similar to my family, many fam-
ilies had children born with a prob-
lem—asthma, diabetes, cancer, heart 
issues. These are children who need 
special care, and many times families, 
when they turned to ask for health in-
surance, were turned away. That is not 
fair and it is not what we need in 
America. We need health insurance to 
protect those families, and that is one 
of the major provisions in the Afford-
able Care Act. 
Secondly, many people don’t realize 
until it is too late that their old health 
insurance policies had lifetime limits. 
There was only so much money the in-
surance company would pay. People 
who got into challenging medical situ-
ations, with expensive health care 
needs, learned in the midst of their 
chemotherapy their health insurance 
was all in—finished, walked away. We 
change that in the Affordable Care Act. 
We eliminated the lifetime limits in 
health insurance policies for that very 
reason. 
We also said health insurance compa-
nies should be entitled to a profit and, 
of course, should charge a premium to 
cover the cost of their administration 
of health care. But we started drawing 
limits on what they could ask. We said 
85 percent of the money collected in 
premiums needed to be paid into actual 
health care, with the other 15 percent 
available for marketing, for adminis-
tration, and for executive compensa-
tion. Eighty-five percent had to go into 
the actual cost of health care, hoping 
to keep premiums from rising too fast. 
That was in the Affordable Care Act. 
When it came to coverage, we de-
tected a problem: too many families 
had their sons and daughters grad-
uating from college, looking for jobs, 
and not finding full-time jobs with 
health insurance. So we expanded fam-
ily health care coverage to include 
children—young 
men 
and 
women— 
through the age of 25. We thought par-
ents should be able to keep them under 
the family health care plan while they 
are getting their lives together and 
looking for work. That was one of the 
basics that was included in the Afford-
able Care Act. 
All of those make health insurance 
more affordable and more reasonable 
for the families who need it. 
Then came the question of what to do 
about those people who have no health 
insurance. Some people don’t have 
health insurance because they work at 
a job that doesn’t provide it and they 
can’t afford it. Others have an oppor-
tunity to pay for it but decide they are 
going to wait or that they don’t need 
it. We hear that particularly from 
younger people who think they are in-
vincible and will never ever need 
health insurance coverage. So the ques-
tion was how do we expand the reach of 
health insurance coverage. We did it in 
this bill. 
We set a standard and said people 
should not have to pay any more than 
8 percent of their income for health in-
surance premiums. If they are in lower 
income categories, we will help them 
with tax credits and treatment in the 
Tax Code to pay for their health insur-
ance. For employers—the businesses 
people work for—they will be given ad-
ditional tax credits to offer health in-
surance, hoping to continue to expand 
that pool of insured people in America. 
For the poorest of the poor, we said, ul-
timately, they would be covered by 
Medicaid—the government health in-
surance plan—and for at least the first 
several years, the Federal Government 
will pay the entire cost, the expanded 
cost of that coverage. 
The notion is to get more and more 
people under the tent—under the um-
brella of coverage. That not only gives 
them peace of mind, but it also means 
for 
many 
hospitals 
and 
providers 
across America there will be fewer 
charity patients. 
Let’s be honest about it. Even people 
without health insurance get sick. 
When they do, they come to a hospital 
and they are treated. When they can’t 
pay their bills, those bills are passed on 
to all the rest of us. 
In my hometown of Springfield, IL, 
at the Memorial Medical Center, the 
CEO there said: If we have everybody 
walking through our front door at least 
paying Medicaid, we will be fine. Do 
that, Senator. That is what this bill 
sets out to do. 
There were some people who objected 
to the part which said, if someone can 
afford to buy health insurance and 
doesn’t, they are going to pay a pen-
alty. Some people called it a mandate. 
Others—myself included—called it per-
sonal responsibility. If someone can af-
ford to buy health insurance, they 
should buy it because 60 percent of the 
folks who don’t buy it end up getting 
sick and the rest of us pay for it. That 
is not fair to the system. It is esti-
mated to cost those with private 
health insurance $1,000 a year just to 
pay for those who don’t buy it when 
they can. That was one of the issues 
being debated before the Supreme 
Court. So this bill, which ultimately 
passed, 
was 
signed 
by 
President 
Obama, has been debated back and 
forth ever since. It became a major 
topic in this year’s Presidential cam-
paign. I don’t believe there was a single 
Republican Presidential candidate who 
didn’t get up and say: I will get rid of 
it on the first day I am in office. Gov-
ernor Romney has said that. Yet when 
you look at all the provisions—the ex-
pansion of coverage—even expanding 
Medicare’s prescription drug Part D for 
seniors—to think we would eliminate 
that, think about the hardship that 
would create across our country. 
We all waited expectantly for this 
day, this day at the end of the October 
term of 2011 for the U.S. Supreme 
Court, and the decision today was that 
the Affordable Care Act President 
Obama signed into law is constitu-
tional. Now we can move forward. 
Some people have said: Is it perfect? 
The answer, of course, is no. I say half 
jokingly, the only perfect law was car-
ried down the side of a mountain on 
clay tablets by ‘‘Senator Moses.’’ All 
the other efforts are our best human ef-
forts and always subject to improve-
ment. The same thing is true for this. 
I am sure the President would say ex-
actly the same. The good news is that 
today, the Supreme Court found the 
President’s Affordable Care Act is con-
stitutional. 
There was, of course, some question 
of one provision or another, but the 
bottom line is Chief Justice Roberts— 
not considered a liberal by any stand-
ards—led the Court in a decision that 
found this law constitutional. The im-
portant part of that is it means, for a 
lot of families, there is going to be help 
through this law. 
In Illinois last year, 1.3 million peo-
ple on Medicare and 2.4 million people 
with private health insurance received 
preventive care at no cost. That is a 
provision in this law that was found 
constitutional today. That means that 
mammograms, cholesterol screenings, 
and other efforts ahead of time for pre-
ventive care will help people prevent 
illness and save lives. 
Speaking of prevention, the law pro-
vides help for States with their preven-
tion programs—programs to help our 
children stay strong with immuniza-
tions, programs that detect and pre-
vent diabetes, heart disease, and ar-
thritis. 
Another reason this law is so impor-
tant is because of lifetime limits, as I 
mentioned. Before this law, insurance 
companies would literally say: Sorry, 
you hit your limit. We can’t pay for 
any more chemotherapy. But because 
the Affordable Care Act was found con-
stitutional today by the Court, 4.6 mil-
lion people in my State of Illinois 
alone received the care they needed 
last year without having to worry 
about an insurance company’s lifetime 
limits. It is prohibited by the Afford-
able Care Act. 
In these tough economic times, as I 
mentioned, when young people are 
looking for work, the fact they can 
now have health insurance through 
their family’s plan up to the age of 26 
is a sensible policy. Two-and-one-half 
million young Americans received pro-
tection under the Affordable Care Act 
because of this single provision, and 
102,000 of them live in my State of Illi-
nois. 
Of course, the law, as I said, requires 
the insurance companies to spend more 
money of their premiums on actual 
medical care—85 percent, in fact. Over 
$61 million has been returned to those

Obama health care plan on their busi-
nesses. 
Scott Womack, the president and 
owner of Womack Restaurants, is an 
IHOP franchisee. He said: 
Let me state bluntly. This law will cost 
my company more than we make. 
Grady Payne, who is the CEO of Con-
nor Industries, said—it is very inter-
esting because Conner Industries is 
headquartered in my home State of 
Texas: 
Conner Industries is headquartered in Fort 
Worth, Texas with plants in 8 different 
states. Conner Industries started in 1981 with 
five people and one location. Today they 
have grown to 450 employees and eleven 
plant locations. They offer health coverage 
to their employees and the company pays 
over half of the total premium cost. In 2014, 
the company will have to choose how to 
comply with the law, either buy a more ex-
pensive, 
government-approved 
healthcare 
benefit or drop health coverage completely 
and pay the $2,000 fine for each of their em-
ployees. Thus, Mr. Payne has stated that the 
impact of this law will cost them over 
$1,000,000 no matter what option they choose. 
The chairman and CEO of NuVasive, 
a medical device company in San 
Diego, in an op-ed said: 
Provisions of the Affordable Health Care 
Act are destroying jobs, hindering innova-
tion and slowing the economic recovery. To 
offset the medical device tax increase, we 
will be forced to reduce investments in re-
search and development and cut up to 200 
planned new jobs next year. 
So what we have seen today is a vali-
dation of what many of us were con-
cerned about when this law was going 
through Congress; that is, the enor-
mous increase in the tax, the fine, and 
the overall burden to the businesses of 
this country which would do several 
things that are not good for the people 
of our country: It will increase costs to 
American consumers; it will inject the 
government into doctor-patient rela-
tionships; it will most certainly add 
new burdens on business in an environ-
ment in which we have over 8 percent 
unemployment. I also think it is very 
clear that though the President prom-
ised that people will be able to keep 
their health care coverage as they 
know it, that health care coverage is 
not going to be there because so many 
companies are going to drop the health 
care coverage they have been offering 
because it is too expensive to comply 
with the government conscription of 
the plan that is required in order to 
avoid the $2,000 fine. 
I think what the Court said is in-
sightful in this respect; and that is, 
while they said this law is constitu-
tional based on the taxing power of 
Congress, they are not ruling on the 
wisdom nor the fairness of the policy. I 
think it is going to come down to the 
people of our country because the elec-
tion this year is going to determine the 
ultimate fate of this bill. The Repub-
lican nominee, Gov. Mitt Romney, has 
said very clearly, on the first day he is 
sworn into office he will ask for the re-
peal of this health care law. 
I think it will become an issue in 
every contested congressional race and 
with health insurance policies, and 
300,000 people in Illinois are included, 
in the form of a rebate, because of the 
medical loss ratio. 
For seniors, it will be a helping hand 
to pay for prescription drugs. They are 
going to be able to help fill the so- 
called doughnut hole and have less 
money come out of their lifetime sav-
ings to pay for the drugs they need to 
keep them strong and even alive. It 
also means preventive care for a lot of 
these seniors, so they are able to get 
the annual checkup in order to detect 
some problem before it gets serious. 
From the business side, the Afford-
able Care Act—found constitutional 
today by the Supreme Court—is going 
to help small businesses pay for health 
insurance. The new tax provisions help 
them do the right thing and buy health 
insurance for their employees. So far, 
more than 228,000 businesses across 
America have taken advantage of this 
new tax credit and have saved $278 mil-
lion. 
When this is all implemented—the 
Affordable Care Act—30 million more 
people 
will 
have 
health 
insurance 
across America. By 2019, 15 million of 
these will be in Medicaid and the rest 
will be in exchanges and in private 
health insurance. 
Another provision in here was impor-
tant and that was the expansion of 
community health care clinics. Sen-
ator BERNIE SANDERS of Vermont, a 
good friend and a great leader on these 
issues, pushed hard for it. I have been 
to these community health care clinics 
across my State. They are wonderful 
primary care in the neighborhoods, in 
the small towns, in Springfield, and in 
Chicago, that truly help people along 
the way. 
Today, the President of the United 
States went to the cameras after the 
Supreme Court decision and talked 
about this decision by the Court and 
this law. He said for those who believe 
the Affordable Care Act was just poli-
tics as usual, it was a political risk and 
he knew it. There were close friends 
and advisers of the President who basi-
cally counseled him not to try and 
take this on. This issue has stopped 
President after President. 
I tried to help President Clinton and 
then-First Lady Clinton when they 
were attempting to get health care re-
form passed. Try as they might, they 
couldn’t get it done. But President 
Obama stuck with it. Even though 
there was precious little help from the 
other side of the aisle, he stuck with it 
and got the bill passed. They then chal-
lenged him in court at every level they 
could, and today—at the highest Court 
of our land—it was found constitu-
tional. 
The President said—and I think we 
all should pay attention to this—it is 
not only good in its substance—and I 
have described that—but it is also a 
new challenge for us, Democrats and 
Republicans, to make it work. The 
American people want us to come to-
gether to make health insurance af-
fordable and available, to incentivize 
quality care, and to make certain 
America, the richest Nation on Earth, 
has the best and most affordable health 
care on Earth. 
It took the Supreme Court 193 pages 
to say it today, and now it is up to us, 
both Democrats and Republicans, to 
work together, maybe put the swords 
aside and sit down at a table and make 
this law even better across America. I 
think the American people are count-
ing on us. The Supreme Court, in find-
ing President Obama’s Affordable Care 
Act constitutional, made it clear that 
now it is up to us to put the policies in 
place that will make it successful and 
help families, businesses, and individ-
uals all across America. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, 
we have had a monumental decision 
from the Supreme Court of the United 
States, and I have to say I am dis-
appointed, because while the opinion is 
not very clear, in many respects, the 
result is clear, and that is we are get-
ting ready to see one of the largest tax 
increases in the history of our country. 
We are all talking about the fact the 
Supreme Court has declared the Obama 
health care plan constitutional, but 
let’s look at how it was declared con-
stitutional. It was not based on the 
commerce powers of the Congress in 
the Constitution. It was based, instead, 
on 
taxing 
capabilities—the 
taxing 
power—of the Congress. 
I wish to read excerpts from an inter-
view George Stephanopoulos did with 
President Obama. 
Under this mandate— 
Stephanopoulos says— 
the government is forcing people to spend 
money, fining you if you don’t. How is that 
not a tax? 
President Obama replies: 
No. That’s not true, George. For us to say 
that you’ve got to take a responsibility to 
get health insurance is absolutely not a tax 
increase. 
Stephanopoulos goes on later to say: 
But you reject that it’s a tax increase? 
President Obama replies: 
I absolutely reject that notion. 
Yet the Court today said this is con-
stitutional because of Congress’s power 
to tax. So we are going to see the tax 
increase go forward, and the small 
businesses and businesses that are 
looking at this, the individuals, are 
going to have a whopping increase in 
the cost of doing business at a time 
when—I certainly don’t have to point 
out—we are in an economic downturn, 
when the private sector is not hiring, 
when we have an over 8-percent unem-
ployment rate. Yet now we see more 
costs on top of what we already have in 
this country. 
I don’t think that is the recipe for 
getting this country going again and 
hiring people to work. 
I would like to read a few quotes 
from employers on the impact of the

June 28, 2012 
every Senate race: Are you going to 
vote to keep this law that has been 
ruled constitutional based on the fact 
that it is a taxing power of Congress? 
The people will be able to decide if 
they want this jolt on their health 
care, if they want the extra cost, if 
they want the intrusion on the patient- 
doctor relationship, and if they want to 
possibly lose the coverage they have 
and be taxed to go into another plan— 
a government plan. 
We are going to see the erosion of the 
quality of health care in this country if 
we are not able to repeal this law and 
start all over. 
Now, I will say the purpose of passing 
health care reform is to provide more 
options for people to get affordable 
health care coverage. I think that is a 
worthy goal. I think we should go for 
that goal in a way that does not burden 
the economy of our country, stop em-
ployers from employing people; in a 
way that preserves the doctor-patient 
relationship and doesn’t intrude on the 
people who do have coverage they want 
to keep. That should be our goal. 
There are several months before the 
election. I hope we will be able to do 
something in this Congress to start a 
new process of providing affordable 
health care options for the people of 
our country and not continue on this 
path of enormous tax increases—which 
have been validated by the Court—as 
well as an intrusion on the quality of 
our health care, and not something 
that in the bigger picture is going to 
keep our businesses from hiring more 
people to get the economy jump-start-
ed, which should be every one of our 
goals. 
I hope we can work on this in a pro-
ductive way before the election, but I 
also hope the people will make the 
final decision in the election if Con-
gress has not acted before; that we will 
have a decisive election that will say 
we can do better. We, the people of the 
strongest country on Earth, can do bet-
ter than a health care system that will 
be eventually turned over to the gov-
ernment if we go down this path. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I 
suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
SANDERS). The clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
So while this bill affects everyone in 
the country, the four States that it af-
fects the most and by far are the four 
States that I mentioned, and Louisiana 
happens to be one. So the people of my 
State pay a lot of attention to flood in-
surance. We always have, and we al-
ways will have to. 
I am sorry to say that just within the 
last few hours, with so much changing 
around here at the last minute, I was 
just given the information that the 
flood insurance bill—which we have not 
even debated on the floor of the Sen-
ate—is now going to be put into an om-
nibus package which includes many 
other important bills: the Transpor-
tation bill, the RESTORE Act—which 
is also important for the gulf coast, 
parts of it that were accepted by the 
House, and there were a few important 
parts that were, unfortunately, left on 
the cutting room floor over in the 
House—and now the flood insurance 
bill. 
I want to make it clear that if I were 
called on to vote on the flood insurance 
bill that is now going to be a part of 
this package, I would vote no because 
there are some very important provi-
sions that I was going to offer as 
amendments to the bill that I think 
are crucial to not just my State but to 
the State of Florida, potentially to the 
State of California, and potentially to 
Texas as well. I am not sure their Sen-
ators are in complete agreement or un-
derstand some of the challenges, but I 
want to point out a few of them. Unfor-
tunately, I am not going to get a 
chance to vote no because I am going 
to have to vote for the whole package, 
which I intend to do, although this 
flood insurance bill is not in the posi-
tion I would support. Let me give three 
reasons. 
No. 1, there is a provision of the bill 
that talks about V-Zones; that is, ve-
locity zones. Right now, with FEMA, 
FEMA basically says if you are in a ve-
locity zone, you cannot rebuild. 
I 
have 
St. 
Bernard 
Parish, 
Plaquemines Parish, Lafourche Parish, 
Terrebonne Parish, Cameron Parish, 
and large sections of St. Tammany and 
St. John the Baptist and Orleans Par-
ish that you can see are designated V- 
Zones. This means likely to be flooded, 
not just based on their elevation but 
the way that the historical patterns of 
storms coming out of the gulf affect 
them. 
I understand that we have to be very 
careful in these areas so I had an 
amendment to say: No, you can rebuild 
but you have to rebuild up to the right 
elevation or you have to rebuild ac-
cording to the highest standards. If we 
do not fix this, and this bill passes— 
which it looks as though it will—there 
will be great concerns or questions, if 
not a downright prohibition, on build-
ing in these areas regardless of whether 
you pay for insurance. This is not 
right. 
The other amendment I was prepared 
to offer is an affordability amendment. 
People may not realize this—I hope 
FLOOD INSURANCE 
Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, there 
are so many important issues in Wash-
ington today, it is hard to know what 
to speak on first. But I am going to 
take this opportunity to talk about 
flood insurance. One of the reasons is 
because there are three States in the 
Union that carry the most policies rel-
ative to our population, and it may be 
the most policies regardless of our pop-
ulation. That would be Florida, No. 1; 
Texas, No. 2; Louisiana, No. 3; and, of 
course, California, No. 4. 
Members will be listening. Again, this 
bill affects all the States, but in the 
underlying bill there is a provision 
that allows these rates for everyone in 
the country to be increased by 15 per-
cent a year. 
People are struggling to pay flood in-
surance now. I think that is very steep. 
People who are arguing for the 15-per-
cent a year increase say it is important 
to get this program actuarially sound, 
it is currently running a $20 billion def-
icit. I am well aware of the need to get 
this program in line. But I was going to 
offer an amendment that simply cre-
ated and expanded a short, small, but 
important affordability provision of $10 
million that the Department would 
have to help people on fixed incomes or 
lower or middle-income families who of 
course are working along the gulf coast 
and in some of these coastal areas. 
They are not sunbathing, not vaca-
tioning. This is not about second 
homes. This is about primary homes. 
They have a right to live and have been 
living for generations near the coast. 
These are fisherman, et cetera. That 
was an affordability amendment that I 
cannot offer or file for the RECORD. 
This is a very important issue. Flood 
insurance is not just about business 
and commerce; it is about culture; it is 
about a way of life; it is about pre-
serving coastal communities; it is 
about being resilient in storms. Yes, 
Louisiana wants to pay its fair share. 
Florida must pay its fair share. Texas 
must pay its fair share. We have no 
problem with that. We have been for 
years. 
Some Members are now waking up 
and saying: Oh, my goodness, now you 
are telling us, people in other parts of 
the country, we have to buy flood in-
surance? But we have a levee. You are 
telling us we have to buy flood insur-
ance? 
Yes. We had levees in Louisiana for 
200 years. Unfortunately, they break. 
Sometimes when the Federal Govern-
ment doesn’t build them correctly, 
they disintegrate and our people get 
flooded. Yes, we have levees, we pay to 
build the levees, and we pay for insur-
ance, and we are still not as protected 
as we could be. Again, we are not sun-
bathing down here on this coast. We 
are producing oil and gas for the Na-
tion. We are running the largest port 
system in North America, and we drain 
40 percent of the continent. 
Florida has a little different situa-
tion. They do a great deal of tourism 
and they do a great deal of sunbathing 
and other things. I am happy for Flor-
ida and their economy. But the people 
I represent are not running huge vaca-
tion operations. This is not an optional 
place for us to live. It is not optional 
for us, it is not optional for the Nation, 
and it is not optional for the world. We 
have to find an affordable and safe way 
to live here. 
I had an amendment to try to make 
this more affordable. That amendment 
is not going to be offered. The only 
positive thing I can say about the bill—

and there are some positive things, and 
this is important, I know, to the real-
tors. I support them almost 100 per-
cent—and the homebuilders. I have a 
very good record with the realtors and 
homebuilders. I believe in what they do 
and they are right when they say: We 
have to have a permanent extension be-
cause we cannot close deals. People 
cannot sell their homes. We have to 
have this insurance program. And they 
are correct. 
Like a lot of things up here, it is a 
balance. With the amendments I was 
going to put on the bill and actually 
had worked out to do so, on balance 
the bill would have been better. I was 
prepared to vote for it on the floor. 
Now that it is being stuck into this 
package without the debate on the 
floor and without the amendments, I 
must go on record to say that I would 
vote against the bill in its current 
form, even though I know we need 
long-term flood insurance. Because of 
the increased rates, the lack of the af-
fordability, and the lack of a fix to the 
V-Zones, I think it tips the balance 
against the bill generally. 
There is nothing I can do about it. 
That is the way it is going to happen. 
But I wanted to submit my comments 
for the RECORD. I can promise the 
Members of this Senate after this bill 
goes into effect you are going to hear a 
lot of complaints from your constitu-
ents. I am certain we will be back here 
within the year, after the elections— 
regardless of who wins and who loses— 
fixing some provisions that should 
have been fixed, but because there is 
not going to be a debate on the Senate 
floor will not be. 
I know this bill came out of the 
Banking Committee in the Senate with 
bipartisan support. I am well aware of 
that. But I think there were some cor-
rections or some perfections that could 
have been done on the Senate floor. We 
are not going to have that opportunity. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded and that 
I be recognized to speak as in morning 
business. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, as we 
know, the Supreme Court ruled on the 
health care law, and we have had a lot 
of phone calls and e-mails. People want 
to know what this means above the 
politics. Sometimes I think that in 
Washington 
everything 
is 
analyzed 
over what this means for the elections 
and what this means to the Repub-
licans or the Democrats. What I hope 
to do today by coming to the floor of 
the Senate is to respond to some of my 
constituents from Florida, and folks 
around the country who have called as 
well, to show what this means in real 
life and what my position is toward 
this moving forward. So that is what I 
hope to do here today in the few min-
utes I have while the Senate waits on 
the pending matter. 
Let’s begin by understanding what 
has happened today. The Supreme 
Court doesn’t decide whether some-
thing is a good idea or a bad idea; the 
Supreme Court’s job is to decide 
whether something is constitutional. 
Today, by a vote of 5 to 4—four of the 
Justices disagreed, but five of the Jus-
tices, including the Chief Justice, de-
cided that a key component of the 
health care law that passed the year 
before I was elected was constitutional. 
They said it was constitutional because 
it was under the taxing powers of the 
Congress. In essence, they said that 
this mandate, this requirement is con-
stitutional because it is a tax. 
That is curious, of course, because 
the President denied that it was a tax. 
I looked it up. I remember a specific 
interview the President gave while this 
was debated where he was asked by 
George Stephanopoulos on ABC: Is this 
a tax? He denied it. He denied it and 
said there was no way this was a tax. If 
I could find the right quote in here just 
to make sure I am not misquoting any-
body in this day and age of fact-check-
ing, the President specifically said that 
the notion that it was a tax was wrong. 
However, months later, when this ap-
peared before the Supreme Court of the 
United States, his lawyers argued that, 
no, this is constitutional because this 
falls within the power of the govern-
ment to tax. So that is important be-
cause that is the reason this law still 
stands on the books today. 
Let’s remind ourselves of what a 
mandate is. This is not a mandate that 
the government provide an individual 
with insurance, this is a mandate that 
a person find insurance for himself or 
herself. For a mandate to work—and 
anyone who has been for a mandate 
will admit this to you—the penalty for 
not buying insurance has to be severe 
enough so that the person will decide 
to buy the insurance; otherwise, people 
will just pay the fine and not get the 
insurance. 
So what does this mean in the real 
world? I found a blog post from 2009. 
The numbers may have changed a little 
bit, I am not 100 percent sure, but this 
is from when the House was delib-
erating at the time. An economist took 
this up on July 14, 2009, and he actually 
used a couple of real-world examples. 
This may be very similar to you, so lis-
ten carefully. 
The first example he used is of a gen-
tleman who is single and earns about 
$50,000 a year, which is four times the 
Federal poverty level, so he wouldn’t 
qualify for the subsidies under the bill. 
Now, he is a single 50-year-old non-
smoker, small business employee. That 
means he works for a small business 
that doesn’t provide health insurance 
and isn’t required to because the law 
requires businesses that have more 
than 50 employees to provide insur-
ance. If he works at a place that has 
five employees, they are not required 
to offer health insurance. So to reit-
erate, he is 50 years old, works at a 
small business that is not required to 
offer insurance, and makes $50,000 be-
fore taxes. He doesn’t have insurance. 
Now, he cannot afford a bare-bones pol-
icy. This economist went through 
ehealthinsurance.com and found that 
the cheapest policy he could find was 
$1,600 a year. Depending on where you 
live in the country, when they start 
taking out taxes, $50,000 doesn’t add up 
to a lot of money. This is middle class. 
He can’t afford a $1,600-a-year policy, 
so instead he would have to pay a $1,150 
fine, which is a tax. That is what he 
would have to pay. Guess what. Even 
after paying the $1,150, he still doesn’t 
have insurance. This is the real-world 
impact of the mandate. 
Here is another example. This one ac-
tually uses my home State, so I picked 
this one. A married couple with two 
kids has a small business. They run a 
small tourist shop in Orlando, FL. I am 
not sure if these are real people or if it 
is hypothetical, but I like the fact that 
they picked Orlando, FL. The husband 
and wife make $90,000 a year at their 
small business. That is what the busi-
ness makes, again, before taxes. They 
have a small business making $90,000. 
Between all the expenses they have and 
all the other tax components that 
come up, it is middle class. This is mid-
dle class, OK? These are two employ-
ees, but their wages exceed the amount 
to qualify for the small business tax 
credit. Because their business is so 
small, there will be no financial pen-
alty for a business that only has two 
employees, but as individuals they still 
have to buy health insurance for them-
selves and for their children. 
So here they are, husband and wife, 
40 years old, two kids, they own a 
small tourist shop, and they are the 
only employees, making $90,000 a year 
together. The cheapest insurance they 
can get is a high-deductible plan with 
about a $6,000-a-year annual deductible. 
It costs them about $3,800 a year. The 
fine is $2,000 a year. So that is probably 
what they end up having to do now. 
This is a $2,000 increase in their taxes 
through a fine, and they still don’t 
have insurance to show for it. 
This is the third example I want to 
give, and this is not part of the anal-
ysis. I pointed out that the law now re-
quires any business with more than 50 
full-time employees to offer health in-
surance. Now, offering health insur-
ance is a good thing. We should try to 
encourage that and provide opportuni-
ties for businesses to do it. Imagine 
you are one of these businesses and you 
are asking yourself if you should hire 
the 51st or 55th employee. Should I 
grow my business? Well, as a result of 
this new mandate, maybe you decide 
not to now. How much will this cost 
us? It is $2,000 per employee if they 
don’t comply. How much will this cost 
us? Maybe this is not the year to add a 
few jobs. Even worse, maybe they 
should become a part-time business.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4701 
June 28, 2012 
I heard a lot about this in my cam-
paign from franchises. Taco Bell and 
McDonald’s are not owned by Taco Bell 
or McDonald’s, they are owned by a 
small business owner. They are going 
to decide to make everyone part time 
because they can’t afford to pay the 
fine. They can’t afford to pay for the 
insurance. This would be a bad idea no 
matter what the economy is because 
now we are discouraging them from 
growing their businesses. No matter 
what the economy looked like, this 
would be a bad idea. 
Let me explain why it is worse. No. 1, 
guess who gets to enforce all of this 
stuff. Guess whom they have to answer 
to. Guess who they have to prove they 
have insurance. Your neighborhood, 
friendly IRS. That is who is in charge 
of enforcing this. Millions of Ameri-
cans now have an IRS problem because 
they don’t have health insurance. 
This idea that they don’t have health 
insurance—because if we read some of 
these statements and interviews that 
the President gave when he said it 
wasn’t a tax, it made it sound as 
though they don’t want to buy insur-
ance and they want to use the money 
for something else because they are ir-
responsible. They are not irresponsible. 
They can’t afford it. There is not a pri-
vate market for them to buy insurance 
because they can only buy insurance 
from their States. If they live in Flor-
ida and there is some company in Cali-
fornia that wants to sell them insur-
ance, too bad, they can’t buy it. That is 
ridiculous. That is what we should be 
changing here. These people are not 
doing it because they don’t want to be 
responsible. They can’t afford it. Their 
house is upside down. They are making 
half as much and working twice as 
long. Their kids want to go to college. 
Everything has gotten more expensive, 
including gas, milk, their water bill, 
and electricity bill. On top of that, we 
are going to hit them with this? 
We just got a report today that shows 
that the economy barely grew in the 
first 3 months of this year. It was less 
than 2 percent. Our economy is not 
growing. When it is not growing, the 
debt gets worse, the unemployment 
gets worse, everything gets worse. We 
should not be doing anything in Wash-
ington that makes it harder for people 
to grow this economy. Why would we 
do something such as this to people? 
Why would we hit the owner of a tour-
ist shop with a $2,000-a-year tax or else 
the IRS is going to chase him around? 
Why would we hit this guy who is 50 
years old, trying to make a living in 
the world working for a small business, 
with a $1,000-a-year tax when we are 
trying to grow our economy? 
Health insurance is a real problem. It 
is. I wish more Americans could get 
their health insurance the way Con-
gress gets it. We get it very simply. We 
get to choose, depending on which 
State we are from, between 8 to 10 com-
panies, and we can decide. If we want a 
higher copayment, we pay less pre-
mium and vice versa. We get to choose. 
Most 
Americans 
don’t 
have 
that 
choice. They get their insurance from 
their job and their job tells them: This 
is your insurance plan. Pick a plan out 
of this book. Those are the kinds of 
things we should be working on. 
So apart from everything else, this is 
a terrible idea because it hurts our 
ability to grow our economy. This is 
the real-life impact of this bill. This is 
the impact it is going to have, and we 
are going to see it. We are going to see 
it in a further downturn in our econ-
omy and in slower economic growth. 
This is going to have a real impact. 
This is a big deal. People across this 
country and across Florida have every 
right and every reason to be worried 
about the impact this is going to have 
on them. This is a middle-class tax in-
crease, and millions of Americans now 
have an IRS problem. People will now 
have to, for the first time in American 
history, prove they have health insur-
ance or they are going to have to deal 
with the IRS. I guarantee that is not 
good for small business. I guarantee 
that is not good for the middle class. I 
guarantee that is not good for eco-
nomic growth. 
That is where we are today. If there 
is anything I hope we can do—I wasn’t 
here when the health care bill passed, 
but I hope some of my colleagues who 
voted for this will think to themselves: 
This is not what we intended. We want 
to help people who are uninsured but 
not like this. This is never what we 
wanted to do. I hope enough reasonable 
minds will come together to either sus-
pend or repeal this, and let’s start from 
scratch. Let’s come up with a real plan 
to help deal with the health insurance 
crisis in America. 
I thank the Chair, and I yield the 
floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Nebraska. 
Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, today 
marks one of the most historic and cer-
tainly 
highly 
anticipated 
Supreme 
Court decisions in a long time. 
I would be less than candid if I didn’t 
say I am enormously disappointed that 
the Court upheld the law in its indi-
vidual mandate which requires all 
Americans to purchase government-ap-
proved insurance whether they choose 
to or don’t choose to. I believe it is fun-
damentally wrong for the U.S. Govern-
ment to intervene in the lives of Amer-
icans in this very direct way. However, 
the Supreme Court’s role within our 
system of government is to interpret 
the Constitution, and they have spo-
ken. So with the ruling now officially 
out, what is important is where we go 
from here. 
The Court did not decide that this 
law is good policy. In fact, Chief Jus-
tice Roberts went out of his way to 
clarify this point. It is clear in my 
mind that we must do everything we 
can to repeal this flawed law because it 
is enormously bad policy. 
While we have waited over 2 years for 
the final decision about this law’s con-
stitutionality, we haven’t had to wait 
that long to learn why the law is bad 
for America. The law was a train wreck 
from the very beginning: backroom 
deals, empty promises, political tactics 
that epitomize what disgusts Ameri-
cans about their government. Some of 
the law’s leading supporters even ad-
mitted they hadn’t read the 2,700-page 
bill. The Speaker acknowledged we are 
going to have to pass the law to see 
what is in it. My colleagues across the 
aisle hastily passed the bill on the no-
tion that there were some gold nuggets 
in there, tucked inside the law, and 
that maybe Americans would think 
they were lucky enough to cash in. We 
have come to know nothing could be 
further from the truth. 
After more than 2 years, there has 
been a lot of rain but not a single rain-
bow and certainly no pot of gold when 
it comes to this legislation. Instead, 
what we have seen is one broken prom-
ise after another. 
Just last week, the administration’s 
own Medicare Actuary reported na-
tional health care spending will in-
crease at an average of more than 50 
percent over the next decade. The same 
study estimated, in 2014, the increase 
in private health insurance premiums 
is expected to accelerate to 7.9 percent. 
But the startling fact is that is more 
than twice the increase Americans 
would have faced in the absence of the 
health care law. 
This is just one of many studies that 
indicate the law does not bend the cost 
curve down as the President promised. 
It begs the basic question: Why would 
Congress pass a massive overhaul of 
our country’s health care system that 
actually increases the cost of care? It 
is so ironic that the majority decided 
to call this health care law the Afford-
able Care Act. One can hardly argue 
that more people will receive better 
care under a plan that drives costs up-
ward as well as puts Medicare on an 
unsustainable path. 
The Medicare Actuary asserted in the 
most recent trustees report that the 
law could lead to significant access 
issues for beneficiaries under Medicare, 
and Medicare itself is estimated to be 
insolvent by 2024. Due to the cuts to 
Medicare and the health care law, he 
said: ‘‘The prices paid by Medicare for 
health services are very likely to fall 
increasingly short of the cost of pro-
viding those services.’’ 
He goes on to say: ‘‘Severe problems 
with beneficiary access to care’’ will 
occur. 
That is just another way of saying, to 
put it very directly and simply, our 
seniors are going to find it harder and 
harder to find a doctor or a hospital 
that will accept them as patients. To 
put it simply, our seniors are going to 
have difficulty accessing medical care 
under this law. 
The health care law perpetuates the 
problems within this very difficult sys-
tem. It is clear that heavy-handed gov-
ernment solutions are not the answer, 
but that is exactly what this law cre-
ates. In this law, there are 159 new

boards, over 13,000 pages of new regula-
tions, and it gives the Secretary of 
Health and Human Services more than 
1,700 new or expanded powers. No one 
will convince me this act isn’t a seizure 
of our government, of our health care 
system, and putting it under the power 
of government. 
Americans don’t want government 
bureaucrats diagnosing and prescribing 
their care. They want the freedom to 
choose an insurance plan that covers 
their needs and to simply see the doc-
tor of their choice. 
It seems the President even manipu-
lated this sentiment, which is why he 
said no fewer than 47 different times: 
‘‘If you like your plan, you can keep 
it.’’ He knew that pledge would help 
him gain support for his law, but, 
sadly, the American public was misled 
and his promise can’t be kept. 
The nonpartisan Congressional Budg-
et Office estimates up to 20 million 
Americans could lose the insurance 
they get through work—the insurance 
they like and want to keep—because of 
this health care law. Families in 17 
States, including my own State of Ne-
braska, no longer have access to child- 
only health insurance because of the 
mandates in this misguided legislation. 
That is not the only way the law will 
hurt hard-working American families. 
The Director of the CBO testified that 
the new law will mean 800,000 fewer 
jobs over the next decade. 
The American people deserve more 
than a laundry list of flawed policies 
and empty pledges. Americans deserve 
step-by-step reform instead of rushed 
policy; transparent reforms, not a 
2,700-page entangled mess; and an open 
debate, not a closed-door discussion 
and the backroom deals that were so 
necessary to get this flawed piece of 
legislation passed. More than anything, 
they deserve sound policy that delivers 
on the promises. 
I will do everything I can to continue 
to push to repeal this misguided law 
and to push for policies that set us on 
the right course because the path we 
pave will define our future as a nation. 
There is no disputing that Medicare 
and Medicaid are two of the biggest 
drivers of our Nation’s $15 trillion debt. 
So if we want to secure a sound future 
for our children and our grandchildren, 
we have to fundamentally reform these 
government programs, not double down 
on policies that will bankrupt them. In 
that same vein, we can’t ignore our 
struggling economy. Instead, we need 
policies that promote business growth 
and job creation. I believe we can pass 
step-by-step 
reforms 
that 
confront 
these tough issues and policies that de-
part from a top-down, one-size-fits-all 
approach. 
The issue of health care touches all 
of us at the deepest level. Whether it is 
a new life entering into our world, a 
tough diagnosis, a lifesaving surgery or 
care for a loved one in their final days, 
health care decisions should not be dic-
tated by Washington. Families and the 
physician they trust need to be at the 
heart of the decisions that impact their 
health. The Supreme Court has spoken 
definitively 
about 
the 
constitu-
tionality of this law, but Americans 
have spoken loudly and clearly when it 
comes to the sensibility of this process 
and of this policy. It is time to repeal 
it and put in place sensible reforms 
that truly do bring down costs. 
I yield the floor and I note the ab-
sence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
SHAHEEN). The clerk will call the roll. 
The assistant bill clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. LEE. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. LEE. Madam President, I rise 
today to speak about the Supreme 
Court’s ruling this morning in the case 
involving the constitutionality of the 
Affordable Care Act’s individual man-
date. In that case, the Supreme Court 
rendered a decision that may be spun 
by many, perceived by many, as a vic-
tory for the proponents of the con-
troversial 
individual 
mandate 
con-
tained within the Affordable Care Act. 
I would submit today, however, that 
this victory, if it is being called that, 
will prove to be not only hollow but 
also short lived. I say that because, sig-
nificantly, the Supreme Court was able 
to uphold the constitutionality of the 
mandate only by a series of gymnastics 
that allowed the Court to find this was 
a tax. 
First, the Court addressed the issue 
and concluded, for only the third time 
in the last 75 years—only the third 
time since 1937—that Congress had, in 
fact, exceeded its power as asserted 
under the commerce clause of the U.S. 
Constitution. 
Having 
concluded 
that 
Congress 
lacks the authority to compel com-
merce, the creation of commerce so 
that it could then regulate commerce, 
the Supreme Court went on to shoe-
horn this individual mandate provision 
into the Supreme Court’s conception of 
Congress’s taxing power. This awkward 
construction is one that exposes many 
of the true flaws of the individual man-
date. 
The mandate itself, we must remem-
ber, was not wildly popular among the 
American people at the time it was en-
acted. It has become even less popular 
as the American people have come to 
understand it. A recent poll revealed 
that roughly 74 percent of Americans 
do not like the individual mandate. 
This is easy for us to understand when 
we think about the fact that we as 
Americans—we are born as a free peo-
ple. We were intended to live as a free 
people. It offends our most basic sense 
of freedom to have one of the most per-
sonal decisions made for us by govern-
ment—particularly by the impersonal, 
distant government that is based in 
Washington, DC. 
These kinds of decisions should be 
made by the individuals and families in 
consultation with their doctors, not by 
government 
bureaucrats 
in 
Wash-
ington, DC. So the fact that it is un-
popular does not surprise us, and given 
the fact that the Supreme Court was 
able to uphold the individual mandate 
only by calling it a tax is very signifi-
cant. It is especially significant given 
the fact that it was pitched to the 
American people as something other 
than a tax. 
The President promised us he would 
not raise our taxes. He promised us the 
individual mandate did not amount to 
a tax increase. He promised us all 
along that he would never raise the 
taxes of any American earning less 
than $250,000 a year. Well, those who 
participated in Congress who voted for 
this provision also promised us this 
would not amount to a tax increase. 
They did so for one simple reason: 
They knew it could not pass. They 
knew it would not be able to get the 
number of votes necessary to make it 
become law if they called it a tax. So 
they did not. They went to great 
lengths to make sure it was not de-
scribed or characterized or structured 
as a tax within the text of the statute 
itself. 
Now, after the fact, the Supreme 
Court 
has 
taken 
the 
step 
of 
shoehorning 
this 
regulation 
into 
Congress’s taxing authority, and it is 
calling it a tax, effectively insulating 
those Members of Congress who voted 
for it from the political liability at-
tached to having voted for a tax in-
crease—not just any tax increase but a 
tax increase that the Joint Committee 
on Taxation has concluded will be 
borne overwhelmingly by hard-work-
ing, middle-income earners. 
In fact, they have concluded that 
over 75 percent of the burden associ-
ated with this mandate that has now 
been deemed a tax will be paid by those 
earning less than $250,000 a year. It was 
unpopular before we were told it would 
be deemed a tax. Now that it is a tax, 
we cannot expect that its status as a 
tax will enhance its popularity. If any-
thing, we can expect that it will be-
come even less popular with the Amer-
ican people. 
For that reason, I am absolutely con-
vinced that for those who call this a 
victory for the individual mandate, it 
will prove to be anything but a victory. 
It will prove to be something that will 
result in a groundswell of people con-
tacting their Members of Congress, 
telling them they do not want their 
taxes raised, telling them that Mem-
bers of Congress who voted for this 
promised them it would not be a tax in-
crease, asking them, for instance, to 
vote on it, to decide once and for all 
whether they are willing now to call it 
a tax, given that was the only way in 
which it could be affirmed, upheld, as a 
valid 
constitutional 
exercise 
of 
Congress’s power. 
As we move forward to the November 
elections, we are going to hear a lot 
about what people do not want out of 
their national government. We will

with people’s right to see the doctor of 
their choice or get health care. 
That is what insurance companies 
have been doing for years. People in 
pinstripes sitting in boardrooms made 
decisions on who could get health care 
and who couldn’t. We stopped them 
from denying families health insur-
ance. We stopped insurance companies 
from denying children’s coverage. Con-
gress ended, as I said, discrimination 
against women. 
I remember when they tried to take 
our mammograms away, and I said no 
and organized the preventive health 
care amendment. We women fought to 
have access to mammograms and other 
things related to our particular life 
needs. The fact is we wanted it for the 
men too. We organized for the preven-
tion amendment so we could limit the 
need of copays for this, so we women 
could have access to mammograms, so 
men could have access to screening for 
prostate cancer, so all Americans could 
get that screening for the dread ‘‘C’’ 
word, such as colon cancer, and how 
about diabetes and heart disease. These 
are the kinds of things that, if we can 
have early detection and early screen-
ing, will save lives, stop the spread of 
the disease or keep it from getting 
worse. 
Diabetes, undetected, uncontrolled, 
and unmanaged, can result in the loss 
of an eye, a kidney or a leg, all because 
one has lost their health insurance. Be-
cause of what we have done in the Af-
fordable Care Act, not only will people 
have health care, but they will have 
the preventive services where, early on, 
they will be able to examine exactly 
where they are and have access to a di-
abetic educator and have the moni-
toring and coaching they need and, 
hopefully, the diabetes comes under 
control and the health care costs come 
under control. That is what we did in 
this bill, and I am very proud of it. 
I travel my State a lot. As I went 
from diner to diner out there in the 
communities, where I could talk to the 
people 
unfettered, 
unchoreographed, 
they said to me: BARB, I not only worry 
about losing my job, but I worry about 
losing my health insurance. I don’t 
know what will happen to my family. I 
fear that I am one health care catas-
trophe away from family bankruptcy. I 
want to make sure my family is taken 
care of. 
I talk to small businesses. How can 
they afford that? They need predict-
ability and understanding and they 
need access to something called the 
health care exchange, where it will be 
akin to an economic mall, where they 
will be able to go to the health ex-
change and see the whole lineup of pri-
vate health insurance companies and 
the benefits they offer. Small busi-
nesses will be able to navigate that and 
see what they need and what they can 
afford for the benefit of their workers. 
This is the American way. This does 
use market techniques, but at the same 
time we don’t use the free market to 
endanger the people in terms of uni-
versal access and some of these others. 
continue to hear a lot from those peo-
ple who are offended by this notion 
that the government can tell them 
where to go to the doctor and how to 
pay for it, who are offended by the no-
tion that government would step in 
and tell Americans: You have to buy 
health insurance, not just any health 
insurance but that health insurance 
which Congress, in its infinite wisdom, 
has deemed necessary for every Amer-
ican to purchase. And if you do not, 
you are going to be penalized. If you do 
not, you are going to be taxed. 
People are going to be upset about 
this. They are going to complain to 
Congress and to candidates for Con-
gress. They are going to complain to 
the President and to other candidates 
for the Presidency that this is not the 
kind of government they want. After 
they do that, they will proceed, and 
they will start talking about what kind 
of government they do want. That is 
where we have to move, away from the 
kind of government we do not want to-
ward the kind of government we do 
want. 
The kind of government we do want 
today is, in so many respects, the same 
kind of government we as Americans 
have always wanted ever since our 
founding; that is, a government that at 
the national level recognizes limits to 
its power, recognizes that whenever 
government acts it does so at the ex-
pense of our individual liberty. 
When the Federal Government acts, 
to a significant degree it does so at the 
expense of our State governments, gov-
ernments which are closer to the peo-
ple and often more responsive to the 
needs and to the evolving demands of 
the people. This is not simply a techni-
cality upon which we are involved in a 
discussion. This is a very important 
part of the political process. It is essen-
tial that any time we raise taxes, we do 
so in a way that is clear to the people 
and that we stand accountable to the 
people for raising taxes. The courts do 
not have the expertise to do that, and 
yet they exercised that power today. 
As the majority opinion today re-
minded: 
The Supreme Court of the United States 
possesses neither the expertise nor the pre-
rogative to make policy judgments. Those 
decisions are entrusted to our Nation’s elect-
ed leaders who can be thrown out of office if 
the people disagree with them. 
This reminds me of one of my favor-
ite quotes from our country’s greatest 
Founding Father, George Washington, 
who said something very similar way 
back in 1789, when he explained: 
The power under the Constitution will al-
ways be in the people. It is entrusted for cer-
tain defined purposes and for a limited pe-
riod to the representatives of their own 
choosing. And whenever it is executed con-
trary to their interests or not agreeable to 
their wishes, their servants can and undoubt-
edly will be recalled. 
This reminds us of the fact that we as 
Americans are in control of our own 
destiny as a nation. We as Americans 
are here and have the prerogative to 
explain what we want and what we do 
not want out of our government. The 
government exists to serve the people 
and not the other way around. The de-
cision rendered by the Supreme Court 
today, while I disagree with it in many 
respects, is one that I predict will 
usher in a new era of robust debate and 
discussion over issues of federalism and 
individual freedom. That debate, I am 
convinced, will lead inexorably to the 
result that we as Americans will be-
come more free, less captive to a gov-
ernment that tells us where to go to 
the doctor and how to pay for it, and 
that we as a people will again prosper 
as we regain our God-given right to 
constitutionally limited government. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maryland. 
Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I 
rise to speak on the Affordable Care 
Act. Today I am so relieved that the 
Supreme Court has upheld the Afford-
able Care Act as constitutional. With 
this ruling, our Nation’s highest Court 
has made it clear that no matter who 
you are—a man or a woman, a senior 
facing cancer, a child with juvenile dia-
betes—you will have health care that is 
available, reliable, and undeniable. 
Health care reform has achieved 
many goals that the American people 
wanted us to do: One, expanding uni-
versal access. Now 32 million people 
will have health care they did not have 
before. Second, it breaks the strangle-
hold of insurance companies, ending 
their punitive practices, particularly 
in those areas of preexisting conditions 
where they denied health care because 
a child might have autism or asthma 
or for women where they had a par-
ticular approach where they charged us 
more than for men of comparable 
health status—30 percent more. Then 
they treated simply being a woman as 
a preexisting condition, or a preg-
nancy, sometimes the need for a C sec-
tion. In some States being a victim of 
domestic violence was considered a 
preexisting condition. We ended that 
practice. 
We 
also 
saved 
and 
strengthened 
Medicare, and we emphasized preven-
tion, early detection, and screening. 
That will save lives, improve lives, and 
also save money. 
I am proud of what we did in Con-
gress with the universal coverage. For 
the first time in our history we are 
committed to covering every single 
American with health care. It helps 
young families to be able to look out 
for their children. It helps young 
adults recently graduated from college, 
some looking for a job, some working 
in startups where there is no health in-
surance. 
Because of health care reform, 52,000 
young adults in Maryland will have 
coverage on their parents’ policies 
while they go back to school, look for 
a job, or get that entrepreneurial spirit 
going. 
Then there are these punitive prac-
tices of the insurance companies. Much 
has been said about how we interfere

June 28, 2012 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. CARDIN. I ask unanimous con-
sent to speak as in morning business. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I 
take this time to comment on the Su-
preme Court decision on the Affordable 
Care Act. This was a good day for the 
American people. It allows us to move 
forward 
with 
providing 
universal 
health care coverage for all Ameri-
cans—affordable, quality health care. 
I wish to quote from a former Mem-
ber of this body when he said: 
For me, this is a season of hope, new hope 
for a justice and fair prosperity for the many 
and not just for a few, new hope. And this is 
the cause of my life, new hope that will 
break the old gridlock and guarantee that 
every American—north, south, east, west, 
young, old—will have decent, quality health 
care as a fundamental right and not a privi-
lege. 
That was a statement from our 
former colleague, the late Senator Ted 
Kennedy, on August 26, 2008. This Con-
gress acted and did what was right to 
move this Nation forward to join all 
the other industrial nations in the 
world to say health care is a right, not 
a privilege. 
The Supreme Court today recognized 
it was Congress’s responsibility, and 
Congress had the legal authority to 
move forward. As a result of this deci-
sion, we are going to find that $10.7 bil-
lion has been recovered already today 
by dealing with waste, fraud, and abuse 
in the Medicare system. We will be able 
to continue with those programs that 
make our health care system more af-
fordable. We will be able to continue 
health care coverage for those between 
the ages of 19 and 25 who are now on 
their parents’ health insurance policy; 
3.1 million young adults have benefited 
from that provision of the Affordable 
Care Act that was upheld by the Su-
preme Court today. 
Seventeen million children with pre-
existing conditions can no longer be de-
nied coverage by their insurers. That 
provision is now safe as a result of the 
Supreme Court decision. And 5.3 mil-
lion 
Americans 
on 
Medicare 
have 
saved, on average, $600 on their pre-
scription drugs. 
As you know, we worked in this Af-
fordable Care Act to close the coverage 
gap—the so-called doughnut hole—on 
prescription drug coverage for our sen-
iors. In upholding the Affordable Care 
Act, the Supreme Court allows us to 
continue to make sure that coverage 
gap is eliminated. 
There are 70,000 Americans with pre-
existing conditions who now have the 
security to know their coverage is safe. 
In addition, in 2011, 32.5 million seniors 
received one or more free preventive 
services. So far in 2012, 14 million sen-
iors have already received these serv-
ices. 
The expansion of benefits in Medi-
care that was under the Affordable 
Care Act, providing the wellness exam 
and eliminating the copayments on 
preventive health services, will also 
now be saved and our seniors will be 
able to continue to receive those bene-
fits. 
On the doughnut hole, the coverage 
gap on prescription drugs will save $3.7 
billion for 5.2 million seniors, with an 
average of $651. This is real money. 
This is the difference between some 
seniors being able to take their medi-
cines or having to leave them on the 
pharmacist’s desk. That is now also 
protected. 
Insurance companies will provide al-
most 13 million Americans with over $1 
billion in rebates in 2012. We put into 
the health reform proposals protec-
tions against excessive premiums by 
private 
insurance 
companies. 
Well, 
that is going to save consumers in 
America over $1 billion. And 105 mil-
lion Americans will no longer have life-
time limits on their coverage. 
Insurance should be there to protect 
you. Before the Affordable Care Act, 
there were limits that might not have 
covered 
extraordinary 
costs, 
cata-
strophic costs. We now have that pro-
tection as a result of the Affordable 
Care Act and the Supreme Court’s up-
holding that decision today. 
It is also important for small busi-
nesses. In 2011, 360,000 small businesses 
took advantage of the tax credit that 
helps small companies afford to buy 
health insurance for their employees. 
When we fully implement this bill in 
2014, small companies will enjoy the 
same larger pools and lower premiums 
that larger companies enjoy today in 
covering around 2 million workers. So 
we have already made a significant 
amount of progress as a result of the 
Affordable Care Act and the Supreme 
Court upholding that law today. 
I wish to talk a minute about the Pa-
tients Bill of Rights. One of the major 
parts of the bill was to take on the 
abusive practices of private insurance 
companies. We all know that was at 
risk if the Supreme Court did not up-
hold the actions of Congress. As a re-
sult of upholding the actions of Con-
gress, we now find, for example, access 
to emergency care, a provision I 
worked on, says it is prudent for you to 
go to an emergency room if you are 
having shortness of breath, if you are 
having chest pains. It is the right thing 
to do to go to the emergency room and 
that your insurance company has to 
pay for that visit. It can’t go by your 
final diagnosis that it may not be a 
heart attack. After you get your bill, 
and it is not paid for by your insurance 
company—you might have a heart at-
tack—this bill protects a person and 
makes sure insurance companies do not 
use abusive practices against you. 
Access to women’s health care is 
guaranteed under the Patients Bill of 
Rights. Access to pediatric care and 
choice of health care professional as 
your primary care—all that is in what 
we call the Patients Bill of Rights that 
protects you against abusive practices 
of private insurance companies. 
Clinical trial coverage is also here, 
and the provision I worked on, health 
There are many things in this bill. 
One of the other things I like so much 
was that we insist that 80 percent of 
the premium we pay goes into health 
care, not into the executives’ pockets 
for perks, privileges or profits. 
I believe in the free enterprise sys-
tem, and I believe in profit, but I don’t 
believe in profiteering. So we said 20 
percent goes into administrative costs, 
and if they can control those, they will 
make a bigger profit. But 80 percent 
has to actually go to rewarding pro-
viders for the health care they do, for 
their education and training. I think it 
is terrific. 
Part of the bill has already kicked in. 
My constituents in Maryland will see 
over $5 million returned to them be-
cause we insisted on this provision. We 
are for providers getting what they 
need in terms of reimbursement but at 
the same time looking at and making 
sure it goes into the health care they 
need. 
Today we have had the ruling of the 
Supreme Court. I was out there on the 
steps of the Supreme Court, and I loved 
every minute of it. As you know, I got 
into politics as a neighborhood pro-
tester. I fought a highway and the 
downtown establishment and I fought 
the political bosses. When I talk to 
young people around the world—par-
ticularly those with aspirations in 
autocratic 
or 
dictatorial 
environ-
ments—I tell them that in America 
when you are a protester, they don’t 
put you in jail, they send you to the 
Senate. I am here because of the first 
amendment of the Constitution—free 
speech, freedom of assembly. 
When I was out there on the steps 
today and heard the roar of the crowd, 
whether it was the tea party who had 
access to a microphone or whether it 
was me who had access to a micro-
phone, I knew the Founders’ vision of 
America had worked. They believed in 
limited government. They believed in 
checks and balances. No President 
should have unlimited power. No Con-
gress should have unbridled power, and 
the Supreme Court would be an inde-
pendent judiciary to act as referee. 
President Obama proposed a bill. We 
duked it out in the Congress and we 
passed it and sent it out into the land. 
There have been legal challenges. It 
went to the Supreme Court, and the 
Court looked at the bill not for utility 
or even desirability, they looked at it 
for 
constitutionality. 
Today, 
they 
ruled that the bill was constitutional. 
I am sure somewhere there is Tom 
Jefferson, John Adams, and his wife 
Abigail, who said they lived the Con-
stitution, and in that health care bill, 
by the way, John, they didn’t forget 
the ladies. 
I yield the floor and suggest the ab-
sence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The assistant bill clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded.

June 28, 2012 
disparities. We know we pay a heavy 
cost in America because of health dis-
parities in minority populations and in 
gender issues. We now have a National 
Institute 
for 
Minority Health and 
Health Disparities at the National In-
stitutes of Health. That will help us 
understand why we have these dispari-
ties in our system and what we can do 
to reduce those disparities, because it 
is the right policy for America and it 
will also save us money. That law now 
is protected. That institute is pro-
tected and is no longer in jeopardy as a 
result of the Supreme Court’s uphold-
ing of the Affordable Care Act. 
Let me talk about oral health care. 
We have talked frequently on the floor 
here about Deamonte Driver, the 12- 
year-old in Maryland who, in 2007, had 
no health insurance and could not get 
access to dental care and lost his life. 
We said that was not going to happen 
again in our State, or anyplace in the 
Nation, and we are proud that chil-
dren’s access to pediatric health care— 
dental care—is protected under the es-
sential benefit provisions in the Afford-
able Care Act that was upheld by the 
Supreme Court today. 
I also want to comment on the im-
portance of the legal decision beyond 
health care. To me, it shows the Su-
preme Court was able to find a way to 
advance the rule of law and to follow 
precedent we have seen in upholding 
programs such as Social Security and 
Medicare, which are mandatory insur-
ance programs. It is the right decision 
on the rule of law. It is the right legacy 
for this Court to find a way—in a Su-
preme Court that has nine different 
Justices with different views—to come 
together on an opinion that upheld the 
authority of Congress to act on a major 
national problem. 
Now it is time for us to move for-
ward. This issue has been litigated. The 
Supreme Court is the final arbiter of 
this decision. It is constitutional. I 
urge my colleagues, both Democrats 
and Republicans, to work together to 
implement this bill in the best manner 
for the people of this Nation. We know 
we are saving money, we know the 
Congressional Budget Office says the 
implementation of the Affordable Care 
Act will save hundreds of billions of 
dollars over the first 10 years and then 
trillions of dollars beyond that in our 
health care system. Let’s work to-
gether to make sure it works. Let’s 
work together in the interest of the 
American people. Let’s put our par-
tisan fights aside, let’s accept what the 
Supreme Court has done, and let’s 
move forward to get this law imple-
mented in the most cost-effective way 
so we can indeed achieve the goal Sen-
ator Kennedy was talking about—that 
every American should have access to 
affordable quality care in the richest 
Nation in the world. 
With that, Madam President, I sug-
gest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam Presi-
dent, I ask unanimous consent that the 
order for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam Presi-
dent, today, June 28, 2012, 30 million 
American people gave thanks, and it is 
because the Supreme Court this morn-
ing upheld the health care law that 
will provide those 30 million people 
with access to affordable health insur-
ance. 
Today is a proud day for America and 
for the values we cherish because on 
this day our Nation’s highest Court has 
reaffirmed that America is a country 
that works for everybody, not just a 
privileged few. We fought for these val-
ues for many years, and this victory is 
just the latest in America’s long strug-
gle for a fairer and more equal country. 
We took the first step 77 years ago 
when President Franklin Roosevelt 
signed Social Security into law, ensur-
ing that in this country no senior 
would go hungry. Thirty years later 
President 
Lyndon 
Johnson 
helped 
America take the next step when he 
created Medicare and Medicaid, ensur-
ing that our seniors and the most vul-
nerable among us would always have 
access to health care. And today our ef-
forts to ensure that every American 
has access to quality health care has 
been given the stamp of approval by 
our Supreme Court. Today we estab-
lished our belief in America, the 
wealthiest Nation on Earth, that it is 
our moral duty to make sure everyone 
can keep themselves and their families 
healthy. 
A little more than 2 years ago, we 
heard the call of Americans struggling 
to pay for health care—parents who 
had to choose between keeping their 
children healthy and putting food on 
the table and seniors who couldn’t af-
ford 
lifesaving 
medication. 
So 
we 
passed and President Obama signed 
into law the Affordable Care Act, and 
already millions of Americans are 
reaping the benefits of this law. 
Thanks to health reform, insurers 
can no longer deny people coverage for 
a preexisting condition. If someone has 
cancer or some other longtime sick-
ness, insurers can’t deny them cov-
erage if they are already sick from 
these conditions. Up to 17 million chil-
dren with preexisting conditions are al-
ready benefiting from this provision. 
Under the Affordable Care Act, insur-
ance companies are prohibited from 
canceling coverage when people are 
sick. And more than 3 million people in 
my State of New Jersey no longer have 
a lifetime limit on their health insur-
ance coverage. 
Today millions of seniors are already 
receiving free preventive health serv-
ices and are saving an average of $600 a 
year on prescription drugs. And it is 
not just seniors who are seeing lower 
costs; almost 2 million New Jerseyans 
with private insurance now receive pre-
ventive health service at no additional 
cost. For women, these services include 
cancer screenings, such as Pap smears 
and mammograms. Since the 1950s, cer-
vical cancer screenings have cut mor-
tality rates by more than 70 percent. 
Think about that—70 percent of the 
people are alive now who otherwise 
would have died if they didn’t have the 
coverage. 
Young people have benefited as well. 
More than 73,000 young adults in New 
Jersey obtained health coverage last 
year through their parents’ insurance 
plans. This has brought their parents 
peace of mind, knowing that their chil-
dren, who may have just graduated 
from school and are making their way 
in the world, will be covered with in-
surance if they need it. 
But even with the Supreme Court’s 
decision, our friends the Republicans 
continue to fight our efforts. They are 
again showing they will stop at noth-
ing to make seniors have to pay more 
for medications, more families going 
bankrupt, and more parents having to 
choose between feeding their children 
and taking them to the doctor. 
Our colleagues across the aisle keep 
telling us that they want to repeal and 
replace health reform, that they sim-
ply favor other solutions, but they 
have no proposals and no ideas on how 
to do that. Instead, they just keep giv-
ing the American people the same mes-
sage: Give your benefits back; we can’t 
afford it—in this rich Nation of ours. 
Well, I have a message for my friends 
here in this place where care is so care-
fully given: If you don’t want Ameri-
cans, I say to colleagues here, to have 
affordable health coverage, then you 
ought to give yours back. That is what 
I say. The Republican hypocrisy is 
stunning. As Members of Congress, 
politicians have access—all of us—to 
world-class health care, but they are 
determined to take away the lifeline 
that health reform law offers to fami-
lies who really need it. 
Let’s be clear. Without this law, in-
surers could once again restrict bene-
fits, cancel coverage when people get 
sick, and refuse care to people with 
preexisting 
conditions. 
The 
Repub-
licans want to return to the days when 
it was legal for insurers to turn away 
sick children, to say: Sorry, you are 
not covered by insurance. No matter 
how sick you are, we can’t give you 
any help. 
And I say to my Republican col-
leagues, stop attacking the American 
health care plan, not the Obama health 
care plan. Start working with us to en-
sure a healthy and happy future for all 
of our children and grandchildren. 
Americans don’t want to relive the 
health care debates with the lies about 
death panels and socialized medicine. 
The American people want us to move 
forward and work together to lower 
costs and make sure no American gets 
left behind. That is what the American 
people deserve from us. They send us to 
this place for 6 years at a time. That is 
the America we must believe in. That 
is the America we fight for. And today 
we are one step closer to making that 
America a reality.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4706 
June 28, 2012 
I speak for myself. Some years ago, I 
was 18 years old and I signed up to 
serve my country in World War II. It 
was a dark moment in our history. The 
war was at its height. My father was on 
his deathbed. He was just past 42 years 
of age. He had cancer, acquired—like 
his brother and his father did—from 
work in the mills of Paterson, NJ. That 
is what they had. My mother was a 37- 
year-old widow. Things were tough. 
Things were difficult. I had a little sis-
ter. My father died, and we all grieved. 
I was already enlisted in the Army, and 
they permitted me to stay home until 
my father passed on. But what hap-
pened is not only did my father leave 
grief, but he left bills—bills for hos-
pitals, for pharmacists, for doctors. 
People shouldn’t have to go through 
that. The coverage ought to be there 
that says: We will take care of you. 
You are an American citizen. Be proud 
of that. And don’t let anybody fight to 
take away your rights to protect their 
rights. No, that is not a balance. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I 
suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
BLUMENTHAL). The clerk will call the 
roll. 
The assistant bill clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent the order for the 
quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. GRAHAM. I ask consent to be 
recognized for 5 minutes to speak 
about the Supreme Court’s ruling. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, there 
are a couple observations I would like 
to make about the historic ruling by 
the Supreme Court today. No. 1 is 
about the legislative process. Members 
of Congress during the debate on 
Obama health care had a very pas-
sionate, heated debate which is part of 
democracy. As I recall the debate, 
when people on our side suggested this 
is a tax increase, that all the fines and 
costs associated with the health care 
bill would be a massive tax increase, 
our friends on the other side, almost to 
a person, said: No, this is not a tax in-
crease. President Obama assured the 
American people during the debate 
that the fine is not a tax. 
I think the reason that was so is be-
cause if we debated this bill and the 
only way we could pass the bill is using 
the power of Congress to tax under the 
Constitution, there would not have 
been 10 votes for the legislation. No-
body would have wanted to go home 
and say I just increased your taxes by 
billions of dollars over the next 10 
years to fix health care, because I 
think most Americans believe our 
health care in this country needs to be 
reformed, and it is in many ways bro-
ken and needs to be fixed, but there are 
very few people in this country who be-
lieve we don’t tax enough and that is 
the problem with health care. 
That is not the problem. The problem 
with health care is not the lack of how 
much we tax, it is the lack of choices 
people have and the competition when 
it comes to purchasing health care. 
Many of us want to give people a 
chance to buy health care outside of 
the State in which they live, which 
they cannot do today. Many of us be-
lieve some form of medical malpractice 
reform will lower costs. Many of us are 
for preventing preexisting illnesses 
being used to deny health care. 
I would like to give individuals the 
same tax writeoffs as businesses have 
when it comes to purchasing health 
care, and I am willing to help those 
who do not have the money to buy 
health care to be able to purchase 
health care in the private sector. 
I am willing to do a lot of things, but 
I am not willing to impose a massive 
tax increase to fix health care. Also, I 
do not think it is fair for people in the 
body, during the debate on a bill, to 
say: This is not a tax increase, vote for 
the bill, and wind up having to be told 
by the Court the only way this is legal 
is for it to be a tax increase. 
Here is my challenge to every Mem-
ber of the Democratic Party who said 
this was not a tax increase when we de-
bated the bill. I am asking now, if they 
did not want to increase taxes to fix 
health care, repeal this bill and work 
with me and others to find a way to fix 
health care without a massive tax in-
crease. If after the Supreme Court rul-
ing they are still OK with the legisla-
tion, be honest enough to go back 
home and say: I raised your taxes to fix 
health care because I thought that was 
the right thing to do. 
Then let’s have a debate about 
whether that is the right thing to do. I 
can promise, it is not the right thing to 
have a debate where the President of 
the United States and the architects of 
the bill assure everyone they are not 
having a tax increase when, in fact, 
that is the only way this bill can stand. 
I believe we all owe it to the Amer-
ican people to be on record. If after to-
day’s ruling Senators are still for this 
legislation, have the courage to tell the 
American people: I am for it, even 
though I had to raise your taxes to 
make it happen. Stand behind what 
they believe. If someone believed at the 
time this should not be considered a 
tax increase and they are upset or they 
are worried that it is now being called 
a tax increase and they think that is 
wrong, have the courage to say let’s 
start over. Nobody is going to hold it 
against a political leader who is willing 
to change their mind if it makes sense. 
I cannot think of a better oppor-
tunity for Congress to revisit an issue 
than this. If there is ever a bill that 
needed to be revisited it is the Obama 
health care bill. It needs to be revisited 
and it needs to start over because it 
was passed on a party-line vote. It was 
passed with statements being made 
that this is not a tax increase when it 
turned out to be. I hope we have the 
wisdom and the courage to start over 
and sort of get this thing right. 
The second point I would like to 
make is that no one in this country has 
suggested that health care needs to be 
fixed through a massive tax increase. 
Let’s find a better model to fix health 
care than hundreds of billions of dol-
lars of new taxes. 
A final thought is, how do we move 
forward? In November of 2012, every 
person who voted for Obama health 
care told their constituents this is not 
a tax. They owe it to their constituents 
to go back and say: Listen, the Su-
preme Court said this can only stand 
with it being a tax. I am either OK 
with that or I would like a second 
chance to fix it. 
President Obama is a good man and 
sincerely believes that health care 
needs to be reformed in a certain way. 
I agree it needs to be reformed but not 
in this way. The President owes it to 
the American people to correct his 
statement when he assured us all this 
was not a tax increase. Many Ameri-
cans found comfort in that. I have al-
ways believed the Court could uphold 
this law under one theory and one the-
ory only. I never believed the com-
merce clause was so broad that we in 
Congress could compel someone to buy 
a product they did not want. The Court 
said today that the commerce clause 
cannot be used in such a fashion. 
The bill was sold as a power within 
the commerce clause. The Court said 
today the commerce clause will not 
allow Congress to make the public buy 
a product. That is not commerce. That 
should make all of us feel better that 
there are some limits on the commerce 
clause vis-a-vis our Congress. But the 
Court did say when it comes to the 
power of a tax to tax, the Congress’s 
discretion is broad. That is constitu-
tionally true, and it has always been 
so. The Congress has the power to raise 
taxes to pay for a war. Even though we 
may disagree with the war, we have it 
in our power to say for the public good 
we are going to raise taxes to pay for a 
war. 
Congress also has the power, in my 
view, to say: The health care system is 
broken. We are going to raise taxes to 
fix it. I don’t think that is the right an-
swer, but I think that is within our 
power. 
The Court said today the fine is real-
ly a tax. Now that we know it is really 
a tax, what are we going to do about it? 
Are we going to leave in place the larg-
est tax increase in modern history to 
fix health care or are we going to be 
smart enough, wise enough, and coura-
geous enough to start over? I hope we 
are wise enough, courageous enough, 
and smart enough to start over and 
this time do it in a way that is truly 
bipartisan. 
The worst possible outcome for the 
American people is for the Congress to 
pass legislation that affects one-fifth 
or one-sixth of the economy and say 
this is not a tax, and at the end of the 
day that is the only way the law can 
stand is for it to be a tax. 
So I hope between now and the elec-
tion we can have another debate about

chairman of the American Conserv-
ative Union. It is an op-ed by Al 
Cardenas, who is the chairman of the 
American Conservative Union. He pre-
sents a strong case as to why this is 
the conservative position that should 
be taken. 
I ask unanimous consent that the 
statement and op-ed piece by the chair-
man of the American Conservative 
Union be printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
[From the Examiner, June 21, 2012] 
CONSERVATIVES SHOULD BREAK 
TRANSPORTATION BILL GRIDLOCK 
(By Al Cardenas) 
it is going to be a wake-up call for a lot 
of people in America. I think it will, as 
he suggested, have a profound effect on 
the elections in November when people 
realize the Court has ruled that people 
who don’t have coverage are going to 
be penalized by $695 per individual, and 
families who do have coverage will 
have to pay an additional about $2,100, 
and the employers of America are 
going to be dealing with the govern-
ment exchange. People are going to be 
concerned about it. I think they are 
going to want to send people to Con-
gress in both the House and the Senate 
and in the White House who are going 
to change this system. 
So I stand on the Senate floor and 
say that is what I am predicting and 
we will see what happens. 
The spending and debt crises of the past 
few years in Washington have forced an im-
portant debate about the proper role of gov-
ernment, and the need for prioritizing gov-
ernment spending. 
The failed $800 billion stimulus, TARP, 
countless bailouts and Congress’ failure to 
make a serious attempt at controlling our 
$16 trillion debt have given many conserv-
atives rightful anger over how Washington 
spends our money. 
Unfortunately, 
well-placed 
mistrust 
in 
Congress’ ability to spend our tax dollars is 
now 
jeopardizing 
legitimate 
spending 
projects, chief among them this year’s trans-
portation funding bill. If Congress fails to 
act by June 30, important transportation 
projects critical to our national defense and 
our economy will lose their funding. The ef-
fects on our already suffering economy will 
be far-reaching and profound. 
While there are important disagreements 
between members of the House and Senate 
on this bill, enough consensus exists on the 
broad framework that there’s no excuse for 
not passing it in time. 
First, the current framework does not con-
tain any earmarks. This is a monumental 
achievement in its own right considering 
‘‘Bridge to nowhere’’ and ‘‘John Murtha’s 
airport’’ served to make transportation ear-
marks the poster children of wasteful pork 
spending. Second, the myriad of highway 
spending categories that used to serve as 
hiding places for pet projects has been re-
duced from 87 down to 21. 
Third, thanks to the leadership of Senator 
Jim Inhofe and conservatives in the House, 
the cumbersome and unnecessary environ-
mental review process for road construction 
projects will see significant reform. How 
much reform is up for debate, but we’re 
going to get something better than what we 
have now, that much is assured. 
Fourth, not passing a bill will hurt our al-
ready suffering economy. 
While big-government Democrats mistak-
enly place their economic faith in the reli-
gion of government spending, conservatives 
know the economic pump is best primed by a 
robust private sector. Government cannot do 
much to stoke job creation on its own, as 
evidenced by President Obama’s repeated 
failures during the past three years. But gov-
ernment can play a profound role in stalling 
job creation and hurting economic growth. 
Failure to pass a transportation bill would 
have a negative effect on commerce and the 
businesses that count on safe and reliable 
roads. 
Perhaps most importantly, those of us who 
believe in constitutional conservatism un-
derstand that unlike all the things the Fed-
eral Government wastes our money on, 
HIGHWAY REAUTHORIZATION 
I want to make one comment because 
we are going to vote shortly on a sig-
nificant bill. It is the highway reau-
thorization bill. It makes me very 
proud because we have been trying for 
a year and a half to do this. When we 
passed the last highway reauthoriza-
tion bill, it was in 2005. At that time I 
was the chairman of the Environment 
and Public Works Committee. It was, 
as I recall and going from memory, a 
$286.4 billion bill. It was for 5 years. Of 
course, that expired in 2009. 
The problem we have had since 2009 is 
that we have been operating on what 
they call extensions. Most people are 
not aware that when we operate on ex-
tensions, we are operating with the 
same amount of money we are spending 
out of the highway trust fund, but we 
are only getting two-thirds of what we 
would get if it were a reauthorization. 
First of all, they can only do it in a 
short period of time. There is no plan-
ning, and they have all said we lose 
about 30 to 33 percent of the amount of 
spending power or money that should 
be spent on highways, bridges, and 
maintenance. 
It is kind of funny because I have 
been ranked as the most conservative 
Member of this body at different times, 
and I am always in the top three. Yet 
I have always said I may be the most 
conservative, but I am a big spender in 
two areas: One is national defense and 
the other is transportation, and that is 
what this is all about. 
I have had occasion to talk to a lot of 
the new members of the conference 
committee over in the House and ex-
plained to them the conservative posi-
tion and the conservative vote on this 
is to vote for the highway reauthoriza-
tion bill that is going to be coming up 
to us. Hopefully, it will be here to-
night. It is going back and forth be-
tween the House and Senate. I believe 
most of the conferees have already 
signed off on this bill, so it is coming 
up. It has been a long time in the mak-
ing. I am very excited about it. 
Let me also say that while I take the 
position that the conservative vote is 
to vote for the highway reauthoriza-
tion bill, I am not alone in this feeling. 
Mr. President, I would like to submit 
for the RECORD a statement by the 
health care. All those who stand by 
this product need to tell their constitu-
ents: I believe in this product, and I am 
willing to tax you in a large way to 
make it happen. If we had had that de-
bate to begin with, this bill would have 
never 
passed 
and 
we 
would 
have 
worked together. Second chances are 
hard to get in life. Congress now has a 
second chance. 
One final thought about Medicaid ex-
pansion. Congress said we are going to 
expand Medicaid dramatically under 
this proposal to insure people not cov-
ered by Medicaid today. If you are 133 
percent above poverty, you would be 
included in Medicaid. In my State 31 
percent of South Carolinians would be 
eligible for Medicaid under the Obama 
health care formula. That would mean 
an additional $1 billion of a matching 
requirement by the State of South 
Carolina to get the Federal money. 
That means my State would have to 
cut education, raise taxes, or cut pub-
lic safety to come up with the money 
to match Medicaid expansion under the 
Obama health care act. 
The Supreme Court said we cannot 
do that to the States. We cannot ex-
pand Medicaid dramatically, which will 
bankrupt States and tell them if they 
don’t agree with the expansion, they 
lose all the money under the program; 
that is coercive. 
In September of last year, along with 
Senator BARRASSO, I introduced legis-
lation called the Graham-Barrasso bill, 
which would allow States to opt-out of 
Obama Medicaid expansion and still re-
ceive the money they receive under the 
current program. That is basically 
what the Court said we should be 
doing. So I hope the Republican leader 
will impress upon the Democratic lead-
er to bring up the bill we introduced 
last September and legislatively allow 
States to opt out of Medicaid expan-
sion under ObamaCare if they choose 
to. 
I guarantee there will be a bunch of 
red and blue States opting out of Med-
icaid expansion under this bill because 
it will make them hopelessly bankrupt, 
and that is not the way to solve health 
care for the poor. That part of the bill 
needs to be addressed too. 
This is a historic ruling by the Su-
preme Court, but for it really to be his-
toric in its fullest sense, Congress 
should take this historic opportunity 
to revisit health care and get this right 
without a massive tax increase. 
I yield the floor. I note the absence of 
a quorum.

transportation spending is at the core of 
what constitutes legitimate spending. 
Article One, Section Eight of the Constitu-
tion specifically lists interstate road-build-
ing as one of the delineated powers and re-
sponsibilities vested in the federal govern-
ment. In Federalist Paper #42, James Madi-
son makes an early case for the federal gov-
ernment’s role in maintaining a healthy in-
frastructure, by stating ‘‘Nothing which 
tends to facilitate the intercourse between 
the states, can be deemed unworthy of the 
public care.’’ 
Let’s be clear—the legislation before Con-
gress is still the product of a Democrat-
ically-controlled Senate, and far from con-
servative perfection. But there can be no de-
nying that it represents a marked improve-
ment over previous transportation funding 
bills. Enough progress has been made, vic-
tories won, and concessions secured from 
Democrats, that conservatives should feel 
comfortable dropping their objections and 
working to ensure passage of a bill before 
June 30. 
The road to reforming government spend-
ing will be long and winding, but conserv-
atives have us headed in the right direction. 
Mr. INHOFE. I am looking forward to 
having this. Certainly, my State of 
Oklahoma is not the only State that 
has bridges and road problems. 
Another good thing we are waiting 
on—and I feel very confident we are 
going to be able to pass this out of the 
Senate—is the pilots’ bill of rights, 
which we are in the process of, hope-
fully, getting done. When that time 
comes, I would like to be recognized to 
talk about some of the great exten-
sions of justice to people who have 
been denied that justice heretofore just 
because they happen to be pilots. 
I will yield the floor, and I suggest 
the absence of a quorum.

HEALTH CARE DECISION 
Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I come to 
the floor today to speak about the Su-
preme Court ruling on health care. Ob-
viously, we were all glued to the tele-
vision set this morning and watched 
this historic and momentous decision. I 
was deeply disappointed with the rul-
ing. I respect the Court and its work, 
but I was disappointed that the Court 
failed to strike down this law as many 
anticipated they would. I was dis-
appointed because I believe the law has 
been deeply and fatally flawed from the 
very beginning. 
It became a major issue, of course, in 
the 2010 election as people watched this 
massive bill that impacts every Amer-
ican get passed without bipartisan sup-
port. The procedures were worked 
around and violated in order to pass— 
even though it was against the will of 
the majority of the American people. 
This was a 2,700-page monstrosity so 
infamously described by the then- 
Speaker of the House as something we 
have to pass first so you can find out 
what’s in it. Well, we found out what’s 
in it. We have had 2 years to examine 
this and we have seen parts of it being 
played out, with more to come. 
I think what we have learned is this 
bill is fatally flawed and it ought to be 
repealed. It doesn’t mean we don’t have 
health care issues we should deal with, 
but we need to deal with it in a bipar-
tisan way that can be better explained 
to the American people and that is af-
fordable. It is labeled the Affordable 
Care Act, but it is anything but afford-
able. In a time of deep recession and 
over a period of the last 2 or 3 years of 
a stagnant economy, this law adds a 
burden of regulation and taxation that 
is working against our ability to come 
out of this deep hole of economic dis-
tress. 
Americans found out what was in 
this bill, and I think it reaffirmed 
many of their deep concerns about 
going forward with a plan that tries to 
wrap up the entire U.S. health care 
system in one big ball—2,700 pages 
worth. It reaffirms the people’s con-
cerns with federal rules and regula-
tions and taxes and mandates. The 
American people are saying that this is 
not how we want reform of our health 
care system. We want to make it more 
affordable and more accessible, but let-
ting Washington essentially decide how 
to go forward without giving flexibility 
to the States and flexibility to the pri-
vate sector to initiate reforms clearly 
is not what the American people—or at 
least the majority of the American 
people—were wanting. 
Despite the promises that were made 
about the impact of this bill by those 
who authored it and by the President, 
middle-class Americans have found 
that the health care law is a massive 
tax. The Supreme Court reaffirmed 
that today. This is not just a penalty; 
this is a massive tax on working Amer-
icans—and not just the rich. It is a tax 
on the middle class and it is a tax on 
every American taxpayer, even though 
the President has insisted, now fa-
mously, on YouTube and every news 
station, that this was not a tax on the 
middle class or a tax on any Ameri-
cans. 
Families have found out their insur-
ance premiums are going up, not down, 
as was promised by those who sup-
ported this bill and authored this bill. 
Seniors have found out they may not 
be able to keep the insurance plan they 
have and could lose access to Medicare 
Advantage. Medicare Advantage is a 
program many seniors have enrolled in 
and found to be successful in address-
ing their health care needs at a reason-
able cost. 
Business 
owners 
found 
out 
they 
would be fined $2,000 per employee if 
they failed to provide workers with a 
health care insurance plan approved by 
Uncle Sam. I don’t know how many 
business owners I have talked to in In-
diana over the past couple of years who 
have said they have sat down with 
their employees and discussed with 
them how much they are able to pro-
vide in health care coverage without 
cutting jobs and without sinking the 
company. 
Many 
companies 
have 
worked out different types of agree-
ments with employees and various 
types of plans based on their ability to 
provide that kind of coverage accept-
able by both the employees and the 
owners of the business. Now all of these 
agreements are wiped out because it is 
determined that Washington will de-
cide what the minimum level of the 
plan should be. Several business owners 
have told me they simply can’t run 
their business in this economy on the 
low margins, if any margins they are 
achieving, and provide that kind of in-
crease in insurance or opt out of it and 
pay a fine of $2,000 per employee. 
For those businesses with under 50 
employees, there is an exemption. 
Other 
businesses 
have 
said: 
Guess 
what. I have 47 employees. Does anyone 
think I am going to hire over 50? No 
way. No way am I going to push myself 
into a category where I have to pay a 
fine of $2,000 per employee if I don’t 
comply with the health care mandates 
out of Washington, DC. So what we see 
is a lot of payment of overtime for ex-
isting workers but we don’t see hiring. 
We don’t see the expansion of hiring, 
particularly in small business, because 
of the so-called Affordable Care Act. 
I have spoken to patients and doctors 
all over the State of Indiana, including 
health care providers, insurance com-
panies, hospital administrators, doc-
tors who are part of a group and those 
individuals who are in a private prac-
tice, and all of the other entities that 
are engaged in health care. They all 
have major concerns with this law and 
to a group, they have opposed this Af-
fordable Health Care Act, or so it is de-
scribed. 
We have a dynamic medical device 
industry in Indiana, as we do in several 
States across this country. It is one of 
the cutting-edge, leading industries in 
terms of our ability to provide new and 
innovative products to make people’s 
lives healthier and safer and to prevent 
a number of unintended consequences 
from various medical procedures. They 
learned after reading this act that they 
were going to be subject to a 2.3-per-
cent tax levied on their gross receipts 
because they were a pay-for for this 
bill. These companies that make pace-
makers, artificial joints, and surgical 
tools find that this tax is something 
that drives them to the point where 
they need to think about transferring 
their business overseas, or part of their 
business overseas, or not hire the 
workers they wish to hire. This is a tax 
imposed on one of our dynamic and in-
novative industries that is leading in 
our exports. This industry may no 
longer be able to compete under this 
tax. 
Just because this ruling that came 
down today saying the health care law 
is constitutional does not mean it is 
the right policy for us to go forward. 
The 
law 
remains 
unpopular 
and

of all of us—should be to reinvigorate 
our economy so that not only can peo-
ple have confidence in their health 
care, but they can have the further and 
indeed very primary confidence that 
they will have meaningful work. 
In that respect, I am glad Congress is 
poised to take action that will enable 
millions 
of 
students 
and 
families 
across the country to breathe a sigh of 
relief about the student loans they 
need to borrow for the upcoming aca-
demic year. Everyone, from every sec-
tor of the country, will tell us that the 
key to our future is higher education, 
that we cannot be competitive in a 
world economy unless we have the best 
educated students in this country, that 
we cannot be the powerful force we 
have been in the world unless we have 
education. 
The key for so many jobs today is 
going on past high school into postsec-
ondary education. Yet we are days 
away—unless we act—from doubling 
the loan interest rate we are charging 
our students. 
There has been quite a bit of stalling 
tactics for months. I hope those tactics 
are over, as the July 1 deadline ap-
proaches. I hope we are soon to take 
action to prevent the doubling of the 
subsidized Stafford loan interest rate. 
I would like to thank majority leader 
HARRY REID for his tireless efforts to 
negotiate a bipartisan solution. I also 
wish to recognize and thank three 
other individuals who were absolutely 
critical in this effort, who were leaders, 
without equivocation, with deep con-
viction; that is, Chairman TOM HARKIN 
of the HELP Committee, who led with 
vigor throughout this effort; Senator 
SHERROD BROWN of Ohio, who has been 
committed to this effort; and also our 
colleague in the House of Representa-
tives, Congressman JOE COURTNEY of 
Connecticut. They have been extraor-
dinary. 
Last January, Congressman COURT-
NEY and I introduced legislation to per-
manently extend the law that makes 
college loans more affordable for mil-
lions of students across the country. 
President Obama called on Congress 
to address the student loan interest 
rate hike in his State of the Union Ad-
dress. Back then, many Republicans 
scoffed at the idea. In fact, they voted 
for budgets that assumed the interest 
rate would double, and they did that 
without any apparent equivocation. 
But thanks to students and families 
across the country who raised their 
voices and made themselves heard, my 
colleagues got the message: Fixing the 
student loan interest rate matters. It 
matters a great deal. It matters to in-
dividuals trying to build a better life 
for themselves. It matters to parents 
whose dream to give their kids a 
chance at a better life depends on being 
able to afford college. It matters to our 
shared economic future because the 
single most important investment we 
as a nation can make is to educate our 
young people. 
So thanks to groups such as Campus 
Progress, USSA, U.S. PIRG, Young 
unaffordable. I wish to state here today 
that I am committed to working with 
my colleagues to repeal the health care 
law and give our citizens the power and 
the flexibility to make their own deci-
sions relative to their health care and 
to use those innovative ideas that are 
out there to put a much better package 
together that addresses the real ques-
tion of rising health care costs and ac-
cess. 
I have traveled our State and lis-
tened to all of these providers and I 
have asked them this question: If the 
health care law is struck down by the 
Supreme Court, what would you pro-
pose? Because we still have a problem 
here. We have rising health care costs 
that have to be contained, we have an 
access problem, and we have a number 
of other problems in terms of gaining 
access to coverage and payment for 
health care issues. What would you 
propose? I have a long list of answers. 
I have talked about it here on the 
floor. I talked about it during the cam-
paign. All across my State I have 
talked about the things I have learned 
from listening to the people who are on 
the frontline doing this business every 
day. There are all kinds of innovative 
solutions out there. There are all kinds 
of things we ought to be looking at. I 
know all of us who support the repeal 
of the current law are committed to 
bringing forward sensible, affordable, 
cost-effective, quality-effective solu-
tions to our health care issues. 
What the Supreme Court essentially 
has done is say that this issue is for 
Congress. Congress represents the peo-
ple. We need to be representative of the 
people. So what we need to do now is 
listen to the people. It is the people 
who will decide the future of health 
care for this country. I believe it is the 
people who will decide in this coming 
election. It is the people who will de-
cide 
whether 
they 
want 
evermore 
Washington—evermore 
taxing 
and 
spending, 
evermore 
debt, 
evermore 
Federal mandates and regulations—or 
whether they want to approach this in 
a different way that can reduce spend-
ing, empower individuals, give States 
greater flexibility, and bring forward 
sensible, step-by-step, incremental, af-
fordable, tested, proven ways of ad-
dressing our rising health care costs. 
So the Supreme Court has turned it 
back to Congress. It is our responsi-
bility now to go forward and represent 
all those who were not listened to when 
this bill was run through this Congress 
in a way that violated a lot of our pro-
cedures and in a way that I believe 
went against the majority will of the 
American people. Here we are, and now 
it is back on us, and we now need to 
stand up and take responsibility. Those 
who voted for it will be defending it, of 
course. Those who voted against it—or 
those of us who were here, partly be-
cause it was an issue in the 2010 cam-
paign—are here to not just simply say 
we don’t like what is there but to offer 
also positive solutions to the problem. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island. 
Mr. REED. Thank you, Mr. Presi-
dent. 
Today’s Supreme Court ruling that 
the Affordable Care Act is constitu-
tional and the law of the land is a vic-
tory, I believe, for Rhode Islanders and 
for all Americans. Families will no 
longer fear financial ruin if a child be-
comes seriously ill or face denial of 
health coverage due to a child’s pre-
existing condition, and they will no 
longer have to worry that the terms of 
their coverage will run out as they are 
being treated after a major medical 
emergency. 
Indeed, tonight, all Americans can 
sleep a little easier knowing they and 
their children will have access to qual-
ity, affordable health care. This is the 
type of security we want for our chil-
dren and what this law will provide. 
Indeed, for the first time in our his-
tory, parents can, with some con-
fidence, trust that whatever lies ahead, 
their child at least will have access to 
affordable health care. We couldn’t say 
that with any confidence a few years 
ago—even 2 years ago—before we took 
up this legislative activity. 
This law has already benefited many 
people in Rhode Island, including indi-
viduals, families, and businesses. Chil-
dren up to age 26 are now able to re-
main on their parents’ health insur-
ance plan. In Rhode Island, this has 
benefited an estimated 9,000 young 
adults and their parents. Over 15,000 
Rhode Island seniors have saved a total 
of $14 million on prescription drugs 
since the law was enacted, an average 
of close to $600 annually. Seniors will 
continue to save on their prescription 
drug costs until the existing coverage 
gap is closed and will continue to have 
access to free preventive care such as 
annual wellness visits and screenings. 
Rhode Islanders can now expect re-
bates if an insurance company spends 
too much on administrative costs and 
CEO bonuses instead of on their health 
care. 
For too long, health insurance com-
panies got away with increasing pre-
miums and decreasing coverage, which 
resulted in higher costs and unfair 
practices. Beginning in 2014, Rhode Is-
landers will be able to purchase health 
insurance on a new exchange, a single 
point of entry where they can evaluate 
the costs and coverage of health insur-
ance options. They will, indeed, for the 
first time for many Rhode Islanders, 
have a real choice about the health 
care they receive and the insurance 
they purchase. According to Families 
USA, 97,000 Rhode Islanders will have 
access to tax credits to make their cov-
erage more affordable. Thousands more 
childless adults will gain coverage 
through the Medicaid Program. 
Now that the Court has spoken, I 
hope we can work on a bipartisan basis 
to do what we must do, and that is to 
create jobs and improve our economy. 
This health care decision is a landmark 
decision, but the work now—the work

Committee and the Banking Com-
mittee, who have put so much time 
into this bill, so much effort. We are 
trying now to get this important and 
complex bill right and then to secure 
the support of both sides of the aisle to 
move it forward. A lot of work has been 
going into it. Everybody is working 
hard to try to accomplish what the ma-
jority leader has spelled out. I am sure 
he will tell us if there are any develop-
ments. 
I yield the floor and suggest the ab-
sence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
FRANKEN). The clerk will call the roll. 
The assistant legislative clerk pro-
ceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unan-
imous consent that the order for the 
quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
FRANKEN). Without objection, it is so 
ordered. 
Mr. REID. Mr. President, I want to 
spend a few minutes and bring every-
body up to date. We have had wonder-
ful cooperation in the last several 
weeks. We have gotten a lot done. Our 
passing the three bills that are left to 
do—student loans, flood insurance, and 
the highway bill—would be a signifi-
cant accomplishment. We are going to 
do it; it is only a question of when. 
A lot of the committees and the 
chairs and ranking members worked 
late last night. I talked to CBO today. 
They didn’t get the information that 
they started scoring until 4 a.m. They 
are moving forward and doing their 
best. As with all agreements, things 
come up, and at this point everything 
appears to be just right. The commit-
tees of jurisdiction have indicated they 
have worked through all these matters. 
They have completed the drafting of a 
revised version of the conference re-
port. We expect this to be filed momen-
tarily—it could have already been 
filed. 
But what we have done many times 
is we have voted on what the House has 
filed before they passed it. We have 
done that many times. It is standard 
procedure. Right now we don’t have the 
consent from all Senators to do that, 
but that could be forthcoming. I will 
report back to the Senate within the 
next hour, after I find out whether we 
can finish this work tonight or whether 
we have to come back tomorrow. 
Everyone stay tuned. At this point, I 
can’t express enough appreciation to 
everyone—Democrats and Republicans 
in the House and Senate. As I laid out 
to my chairmen at the lunch I had yes-
terday, this has been truly an example 
of what legislation is all about—com-
promise. Compromise really sounds 
good. Legislation is the art of com-
promise—until you are faced, as a Sen-
ator, with something you may not get 
because of the overall good of the bill. 
Sometimes we have to understand that 
we have to give things up for the bet-
terment of this country. We cannot let 
the perfect be the enemy of the good. 
So everyone understands that to this 
point. 
As I have indicated, we will know 
within the next hour, and I will report 
back as to whether we can finish to-
night or come back tomorrow. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Illinois. 
SURFACE TRANSPORTATION 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank 
the majority leader and especially Sen-
ators BOXER and INHOFE, as well as 
their counterparts on the Commerce 
Invincibles, and the Rebuild the Dream 
coalition that pushed this issue to the 
forefront where it belongs. The letters, 
e-mails, calls, visits, bus tours, and 
campus rallies made a difference. 
We should soon be voting, I hope, to 
keep this student loan rate low for an-
other year. However, it is important to 
remember this is only a temporary, 
short-term fix. Now we need to develop 
longer term solutions to the growing 
burden of student loan debt, the rising 
cost of college, and the need to improve 
higher education outcomes so students 
complete their degrees and get the full 
benefit of their investment in edu-
cation. 
These are tough issues, but we have 
to address them head on. Our economy 
and our future depends on addressing 
these issues. 
It is estimated, for example, that 
more than 60 percent of the jobs will 
require some postsecondary education 
by the year 2018. In 2010, only 38 per-
cent of working-age adults held a 2- 
year or 4-year degree. We have very few 
years to go from 40 percent to 60 per-
cent. That gap represents the challenge 
we have in being a competitive eco-
nomic force in the world. Certainly, if 
we are ever going to close that gap, we 
have to make sure we do not double the 
interest rate on Stafford loans, as a 
first step. 
But, as I suggest, there are many 
other steps we must take. We have to 
address the rising cost of college. The 
cost of attending college has increased 
by 559 percent since 1985—559 percent— 
rising far faster than costs for gasoline, 
health care, and other consumer items. 
Keeping student loans affordable and 
interest rates low is one part of the so-
lution. 
Providing 
more 
grant 
aid 
through Pell grants and other pro-
grams is another. 
We need to call on institutions to do 
their part to keep costs in check. Yes, 
the college community has to rally 
around this and has to think of innova-
tive ways to provide excellent edu-
cation at a lower cost, a more afford-
able cost. States have to play a role 
too. When State support for higher 
education goes down, tuition goes up. 
The crises of so many States—real cri-
ses, difficult crises—have forced them 
to reduce their support for higher edu-
cation, and the result, as I suggest, has 
been tuitions climb, and that is an-
other burden middle America and mid-
dle-class, middle-income families are 
bearing. 
I look forward to working with my 
colleagues on developing a comprehen-
sive 
approach 
to 
addressing 
these 
issues. 
Also, I would just like to say, I hope 
we are on the verge—at least for the 
next year—of avoiding a doubling of in-
terest rates on student loans. We have 
a long way to go to ensure that every 
American with talent and drive and the 
skills has the means to go to college. 
This is an important first step. There 
are many more we must take, and I 
hope we do that very quickly. 
POLITICAL PRISONERS 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, off and 
on and for some time I have come to 
the floor to speak about an issue that 
doesn’t receive a lot of attention, 
which is political prisoners in foreign 
lands—journalists 
in 
Cameroon, 
an 
AIDS activist in Uzbekistan, and a lot 
of others. I am pleased that over the 
years, working with many of my col-
leagues, we have been able to see many 
of these innocent political victims re-
leased. Former Senator Brownback, as 
well as Senators CARDIN, CASEY, Ken-
nedy, LIEBERMAN, and RUBIO have all 
been part of a joint effort to deal with 
these political prisoners. 
Sadly, there is no shortage of polit-
ical prisoners in this world. They lan-
guish in horrible prisons in places such 
as Iran and North Korea. Today I want 
to focus on a number of them, and I 
will preface my remarks by apologizing 
ahead of time for my pronunciation of 
these names. Some of these are ex-
tremely difficult to pronounce for 
those of us in the States, particularly 
from the Midwest. 
I suppose one might start typically 
with the most outrageous case, but, 
tragically, all of the cases I speak to fit 
that definition. Let me start with the 
heartbreaking case from 6 years ago— 
that of Gambian journalist Ebrima 
Manneh. 
Manneh was a reporter for the Daily 
Observer newspaper. He was allegedly 
detained by plainclothes Gambian se-
curity officials. He was held incommu-
nicado for years, although he was seen 
during the initial years of his deten-
tion by witnesses in at least one deten-
tion facility and one hospital. No one 
has seen him for years. It is possible he 
died in custody. But imagine the pain 
and uncertainty of his family, who 
have no help and no answers. 
The Economic Community of West 
African States Court of Justice, which 
has jurisdiction over Gambia, and the 
United Nations Working Group on Ar-
bitrary Detention both ruled against 
the Gambian Government on the case 
and called for his release. After years 
of waiting, the Gambian Government 
recently requested United Nations help 
to investigate Manneh’s case and the 
death of one other journalist. 
This was a welcome move by the 
Gambian Government, and I hope ongo-
ing discussions with the United Na-
tions will expedite the investigation 
and bring some resolution to the case 
and answers for Manneh’s family. 
Some years ago, there was a change 
in leadership in Turkmenistan, one

that many hoped would open that 
country’s closed and repressive polit-
ical system. Unfortunately, President 
Berdimuhamedov has yet to meet those 
modest expectations. One would think 
in a country where the President wins 
an election with a 97-percent vote, and 
where there is an annual week of hap-
piness, that Turkmen leadership could 
be more gracious to its political oppo-
nents. Unfortunately, the following ex-
amples demonstrate just the opposite. 
Gulgeldy Annaniyazov is a long-time 
political dissident who left Turkmeni-
stan in 2000 to settle in Norway as a po-
litical refugee. He reportedly returned 
to Turkmenistan in June 2008 to visit 
his family and was arrested. After a 
closed trial on October 7, he was sen-
tenced to 11 years in prison. 
Annakurban 
Amanklychev 
and 
Sapardurdy Khadzhiev are members of 
the human rights organization Turk-
menistan Helsinki Foundation. They 
were convicted in August 2006 after 
trials of only 2 hours and sentenced to 
6 and 7 years in jail on charges that 
were never very clear. 
Unfortunately, we don’t have a pho-
tograph of Mr. Khadzhiev. Turkmeni-
stan Government officials have been 
quoted as asserting these individuals 
were arrested and convicted for ‘‘gath-
ering slanderous information to spread 
public discontent.’’ 
The legal bases for their detention 
are suspect at best and raise serious 
concerns 
of 
political 
intimidation, 
questionable charges, closed trials, and 
inappropriately punitive punishment. 
In May 2010, more than 20 Senators— 
and that is not an easy feat in the Sen-
ate—signed a letter to Secretary of 
State Clinton urging the administra-
tion to raise these cases with the Turk-
menistan leadership. I know the State 
Department did in fact take those 
steps, and I thank them, but I hope 
they will continue. 
In November 2010, the United Nations 
Working Group on Arbitrary Detention 
released its opinion that the arrest and 
continued detention of the Turkmeni-
stan Helsinki Foundation members is 
arbitrary and in violation of the Uni-
versal Declaration of Human Rights 
and the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights. That United 
Nations group called on the Turkmen 
Government to immediately release 
them. 
Sadly, they continued to languish 
under harsh sentences that include 
hard labor, torture, and forced psycho-
tropic drug injections. 
To the leaders of Turkmenistan, I 
say, if you want to change the image of 
your nation in the world, you must re-
lease these and other political pris-
oners. 
Some who follow this may wonder 
what difference it makes if I make a 
speech on the floor of the Senate about 
someone languishing in a prison in 
Turkmenistan. All I can tell you is 
that after years of doing this, it does 
make a difference. It turns out, people 
listen. And when they listen, some-
times they react, and often in a posi-
tive way. These people languishing in 
prisons do not believe anybody in the 
outside world knows they are alive. 
Groups are trying to make sure others 
are aware of that fact, and that is why 
I come to the floor, as many of my col-
leagues do. 
It is hard to believe in Europe there 
is still one regime like that of Alex-
ander Lukashenko. He is often known 
as the last dictator of Europe. I have 
been to Belarus twice, once with the 
Helsinki Commission group, led by 
Senator CARDIN of Maryland, where we 
actually 
met 
this 
President 
Lukashenko; and most recently I went 
there after the highly suspect 2010 elec-
tions held in December. What was egre-
gious about this election was that 
President Lukashenko, on the night of 
the election, beat up and arrested all 
the candidates who had the nerve to 
run against him, as well as hundreds of 
Belarusian citizens who showed up in 
central Minsk to protest his actions. 
Lukashenko’s barbaric behavior, and 
that of his KGB henchmen—and, yes, 
Belarus still has something called a 
KGB 
security 
service—earned 
him 
sweeping condemnation from Europe 
and the United States, further iso-
lating his nation and hurting his own 
people. 
Sadly, today, a year and a half after 
this outrage, Lukashenko is still hold-
ing the man in this photograph. This 
Presidential 
candidate—Mikalai 
Statkevich—was sentenced to 6 years 
in a medium security prison for having 
the nerve to run against Lukashenko. 
At least 6, and as many as 13, other 
protestors from the election still sit in 
jail. 
This is outrageous in Europe today or 
anywhere on the planet, for that mat-
ter. It is time for President Luka-
shenko to let this man and these peo-
ple go. 
Next I turn to Vietnam. Although 
our bilateral relationship continues to 
improve with Vietnam, we cannot ig-
nore the troubling disregard for free-
dom of speech in that country. It is il-
lustrated by the unfounded detention 
of the popular blogger Nguyen Van Hai, 
better known as Dieu Cay. 
Let me show this photograph of him. 
He is the head of the Free Vietnamese 
Journalists’ Club, and as such Cay has 
been detained almost continuously by 
Vietnamese 
authorities 
since 
2008, 
when he was convicted and tried for 
trumped-up tax evasion charges. 
In 2009, the U.N. Working Group on 
Arbitrary Detention highlighted Cay’s 
case, as well as the ‘‘illegal arrests’’ 
and continued persecution of a number 
of other Internet bloggers. 
In October 2010, on the day Cay was 
due to be released, having fulfilled his 
sentence, he was transferred to a new 
jail and re-arrested for violating a se-
curity provision that prohibits propa-
gandizing against the government. The 
propaganda 
in 
question—3-year-old 
blog postings. The subject of his propa-
ganda—freedom of speech, and other 
issues considered by the government to 
be too sensitive, such as labor strikes 
and the trials of two human rights law-
yers. 
Cay’s arrest is part of a well-docu-
mented trend in Vietnam in which na-
tional security concerns have been 
cited as a pretext for arrests and crimi-
nal investigations. 
The 
State 
Department’s 
Human 
Rights report notes the Vietnamese 
Government is increasing suppression 
of dissent, increasing measures to limit 
freedom of the press, speech, assembly 
and association, and increasing restric-
tions on Internet freedom. The trend is 
clear, and it is very concerning. 
Secretary Clinton noted in a speech 
last year on Internet Rights and 
Wrongs, ‘‘In Vietnam, bloggers who 
criticize the government are arrested 
and abused.’’ 
It is long overdue that Vietnamese 
leaders release Cay and stop harassing 
journalists and bloggers. 
Lastly, on Saudi Arabia, our ally on 
many important issues, but also a 
friend with whom we have vast dif-
ferences when it comes to basic free-
doms and women’s rights. Let me tell a 
recent story that is truly hard to be-
lieve. 
Since early 2012, the Saudi Govern-
ment 
has 
imprisoned 
23-year-old 
blogger Hamza Kashgari. His crime? He 
tweeted an imaginary conversation 
with the Prophet Muhammad. That ac-
tion sparked a spate of death threats, 
causing him to remove the tweet and 
flee to New Zealand in fear of his life. 
While stopping in Malaysia for a plane 
transfer, 
Malaysian 
authorities 
de-
tained him until their Saudi counter-
parts swooped in and returned him to 
Saudi Arabia under arrest. 
Back in the kingdom—facing accusa-
tions of blasphemy and calls for his 
execution by top clerics—he repented 
before the Saudi court and showed 
great remorse, asking for forgiveness. 
That was 4 months ago, yet he remains 
imprisoned, awaiting his fate, with no 
sense when a decision will be made. 
I can imagine his actions sparking a 
debate in Saudi Arabia, but leading to 
calls for a death sentence for blas-
phemy? In today’s world, that is hard 
to believe. 
Saudi Arabia has initiated steps to-
ward social, educational, judicial, and 
economic reform, and we encourage 
them to do more. Immediately freeing 
Mr. Kashgari would be an important 
move. This man has suffered enough 
and deserves his freedom now. 
These are just a sample of the many 
political prisoners who still suffer in 
parts of the world. I want them and 
their families and the governments 
that unjustly imprison them to know 
they are not forgotten. I and my col-
leagues here in the Senate will con-
tinue to do our best to draw attention 
to their plight, work for their release, 
and stand up for the cause of human 
rights in the United States and around 
the world.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4712 
June 28, 2012 
Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I 
suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The assistant legislative clerk pro-
ceeded to call the roll. 
Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
BEGICH). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
SURFACE TRANSPORTATION 
Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, we are 
anxiously awaiting work on the Trans-
portation bill that came out of the En-
vironment and Public Works Com-
mittee, of which I am proud to be the 
chairman. 
Last year we wrote a bill called 
MAP–21. That stands for Moving Ahead 
for Progress in the 21st Century. I was 
proud to see this bill become a bipar-
tisan bill, with Senator INHOFE work-
ing with me and his staff and my staff 
working together as one. When we got 
it out of the committee, I think it was 
a unanimous, or close to unanimous, 
vote. 
I know when our young people learn 
how a bill becomes a law it sounds a 
little easier than it really is. I often 
think, in my spare time I should write 
a little pamphlet on how a bill really 
becomes a law because I would say to 
the young people who are here today, 
as well as those who might be listen-
ing, it is a little trickier than it sounds 
because when we learn about how a bill 
becomes a law in school, it is very sim-
ply put. 
The bill starts in a committee in the 
House or Senate, and it moves to the 
floor of that body. Then it starts in a 
committee in the other body, it moves 
to the floor of that body. It passes both 
Chambers. If it is identical, it goes to 
the President. If there are differences, 
there is a conference committee, and 
then it goes to the President. The 
President either signs it or vetoes it. If 
he signs it, it is a done deal. If he ve-
toes it, we need to have a whole lot of 
votes—two-thirds—to override. 
So that is how it is taught in schools, 
and it is absolutely true. But getting it 
to the point where we are now, where 
we await a conference report, is some-
times a very long and winding path. 
This one was a long and winding path. 
I think we are where we are, at the 
point where we hope to vote soon on it, 
because people were willing to meet 
each other halfway. 
I have been saying for a long time, 
we all stand in our respective corners 
and insist that it is our way or the 
highway and nothing ever gets done. 
We must come together, and the Sen-
ate proved it can come together around 
our version of the highway bill. It 
passed by 74 votes. We were hopeful the 
House would just take it up and pass it. 
It didn’t happen that way. They wrote 
a less comprehensive bill; they sent it 
over; and then we went into a con-
ference committee. There was a lot of 
difficulty because there were issues 
that were simply not seen in the same 
light between the House and Senate. 
I would have to say, through all of 
this Senator INHOFE and I, Republicans 
and Democrats, on the EPW Com-
mittee were united. But we didn’t have 
that unifying factor with the House 
Republicans. I want to thank every 
member of the conference committee, 
Democratic and Republican, House and 
Senate, because everyone worked ex-
tremely hard. They worked hard. They 
were 
knowledgeable. 
Their 
staffs 
worked hard. They asked a lot of ques-
tions. 
They 
cared 
a 
tremendous 
amount about the policies. 
The great news about the bill that is 
coming out of the conference com-
mittee is that it is a jobs bill, first and 
foremost. It is going to save about 1.9 
million—almost 2 million—jobs that 
are currently held in the private sec-
tor, and it will create up to 1 million 
new jobs through an expanded TIFIA 
program. TIFIA is a program that 
fronts the funds for local government 
to have a revenue stream, and the le-
verage on that is about 30 to 1. So if 
you have an amount of approximately 
$1 billion, you will be able to get $30 
billion of economic activity. So that is 
a good part that we can all be proud of. 
That is a fact. 
The bill will be coming soon, we 
hope. It is not here yet, and it is not 
done yet, but it is close. What we hope 
we will have before us is a bill that cre-
ates close to 2 million—I am so tired. I 
have to say, I haven’t gotten much 
sleep in the past 3 days because we 
have been working nonstop. 
I will say it again. We protect almost 
2 million jobs that are currently held 
in the private sector, and we will cre-
ate up to 1 million; hence, the 3 million 
jobs that are relying on this bill. 
We have thousands of businesses that 
care a lot about what we do. These are 
general contractors, these are equip-
ment dealers, these are people in the 
concrete industry. I can tell you these 
organizations of business and labor 
have been behind us every inch of the 
way. When I was giving up hope be-
cause I didn’t think we could move for-
ward, they were there to say: Keep on 
going. And they weighed in. I think the 
work product reflects the fact that we 
would never, ever give up. 
There is a lot of talk about, What did 
Democrats give up? What did Repub-
licans give up? Let’s just say this is a 
negotiation between Republicans and 
Democrats, a negotiation between the 
House and Senate, and not everybody 
got what he or she wanted. That is for 
sure. 
But I just want to say to people who 
might be listening that in a negotia-
tion nobody gets everything they want. 
You have to meet each other halfway, 
and that is what happened in this nego-
tiation. 
We both wanted to see this as a re-
form bill. The Senate brought a pack-
age together that took the 90 programs 
down to 30, and that pretty much sur-
vived the conference committee. We 
also did some more reforms, certainly, 
on project delivery because all sides 
agree it is taking too long to get some 
of these public works projects done. It 
is taking sometimes 15 years, 14 years, 
13 years to do a road start to finish or 
to do a bridge. We need to make sure 
we can move faster because our econ-
omy needs that, but still, in my view, 
protect the rights of citizens through-
out this country to ensure their com-
munities are taken care of, that there 
is no damage to their communities, 
that the air quality is protected, the 
water quality is protected. 
We were able to keep those environ-
mental laws while we were tough on 
deadlines and milestones and very 
tough to say: This is it. If you can’t 
finish in this time, and we are trying 
to get this for 15 years to 8 years per 
project—if you don’t do that, you have 
to explain why. There has to be a real-
ly good reason why these projects 
would be delayed. 
I believe the funding in the bill is 
fair. Every single State is protected. 
This is a 2-year-3-month bill. Every 
State will get the amount of money 
they got last year, plus inflation. That 
is very important. It is the current 
level of funding with the inflation put 
in, and every State can now know, if 
and when this bill passes, that they can 
count on that funding for 2 years and 3 
months. Everything is paid for. 
There are a lot of comments about, 
what did we do about pedestrian walk-
ways and bike paths. I want to be 
clear. That was an intense subject of 
negotiations. There were those who 
wanted no funds set aside for bike 
paths, pedestrian paths, and it was 
very clear—safe streets, safe roads to 
school, et cetera—we had to negotiate 
on this. 
Honestly, I think what has come out 
is a good thing, and let me explain 
why. We kept the same amount of 
funding, same set-aside percentage for 
these transportation alternatives, but 
what we said was, for the first time, 
half of those funds will go directly to 
locals, will go to the metropolitan 
planning organizations, will go to the 
large cities. That is key because we 
want the local people, who know their 
area best, making these decisions. We 
protected those funds. The only way 
anyone in the State can use those 
funds is if there is a nationally de-
clared disaster and there are some un-
obligated funds around—yes, that could 
be borrowed but must be paid back 
from any supplemental appropriation. 
On the State portion, which is the 
other 50 percent, we built in more flexi-
bility, and there are a lot of people who 
are calling this a cut. It is not a cut. 
Some States will use it all. I say to the 
people in the States who are worried 
about it, use your pressure, use your 
power, use your grassroots strength to 
make sure you lobby your State legis-
latures and your Governors to provide 
for safe streets to schools, for bike 
paths, for pedestrian walkways. These 
are very important safety issues.

June 28, 2012 
I know not everyone is happy, but I 
wanted to be clear on that. If the 
choice is between doing away with that 
wonderful program, which I think is 
wonderful, or making a few concessions 
on flexibility, I think we did the right 
thing. I honestly do. 
This bill is all paid for. I have to 
thank so much Senator MAX BAUCUS 
and his team, the Republican members 
of the Finance Committee, and also the 
team in the House headed by Mr. CAMP 
because they came up with a pay-for 
that people on all sides can live with. 
It gives us that security for 2 years and 
3 months. 
We don’t have any riders on this bill. 
I know some people very much wanted 
it. We don’t have them. It became part 
of the give-and-take at the end of the 
day. 
Two provisions that I lament are not 
on there are the oceans trust fund, 
which is part of the RESTORE Act, and 
the Land and Water Conservation Fund 
that was also part of the RESTORE 
Act. I lament that those provisions are 
gone. I commit myself to working with 
Senator WHITEHOUSE
on the oceans 
trust fund and Senator BAUCUS on the 
Land and Water Conservation Fund to 
get that done. But I have to be com-
pletely, totally frank with the Senate; 
we just could not get it done. There 
was nothing we could offer or give that 
would allow us to move forward with 
those two very critical environmental 
programs. 
I tell you, our oceans deserve atten-
tion and our land deserves attention. 
These issues are certainly not going 
away. Having said that, the rest of the 
RESTORE Act is in this bill. That 
means those folks in the Gulf States 
who were so harmed by this horrible 
BP spill will be able to use some of 
those fines as they come in to restore— 
that is why we called it the RESTORE 
Act—restore their environments, re-
store their fisheries, restore the dam-
age that was done by that horrific BP 
spill. We don’t know how much money 
will come from those fines. We will 
watch it very carefully. But we know 
that when they do come—if this bill 
passes, and I am very hopeful it will— 
our Gulf States will have the help they 
need. 
I want to say to the people, particu-
larly in Louisiana, whom I visited 
many times, your Senators work very 
hard. I would say MARY LANDRIEU took 
the lead on this. Senator VITTER was 
on the conference. I want to say that 
MARY LANDRIEU—you know her well— 
is unrelenting, and she was very clear 
with us. 
I want to say to my friend in the 
chair, from Alaska, how helpful he was 
to us, pointing out some of the great 
unmet needs he is dealing with in his 
State, a beautiful State, a very inter-
esting State that has unique needs. I 
want him to know how much I appre-
ciated his working with us, giving us 
the facts as we needed them. I also 
thank Senator MURKOWSKI, but I par-
ticularly want to say to Senator 
BEGICH, thank you. You happen to be in 
the chair, and I believe you were men-
tally effective for your State. Really, 
you made the case for fairness. I hope 
you are comfortable with how this bill 
turned out. 
I have never met a team of more 
dedicated staff—never. Again, they are 
not resting because we are not done. 
Until we are done, they are not resting. 
But we are talking seriously about this 
staff getting 3 or 4 hours of sleep over 
the last 2 or 3 days. The issues were 
still coming at us in ways we could not 
believe at noon today. Last night we 
had to work out some issues. 
It has been, in many ways, a very dif-
ficult negotiation but certainly, if and 
when this bill comes before us and it is 
passed, a very satisfying one. 
I have to mention Bettina Poirier, 
who is my chief of staff and chief coun-
sel. I have never seen anyone more pro-
fessional, more energetic, more persua-
sive. I have to thank her counterparts: 
David, Grant, Andrew, Jason, Tyler, 
Mary, Kate, and Paul, all of whom were 
just amazing. If I left anyone out, for-
give me; I will correct it in the RECORD 
if I did. 
I have to say to the staff of Senator 
INHOFE that you were amazing—part of 
the team. You worked together. If we 
had disagreements, we talked them 
out, but for the most part we were on 
the same page. So Ruth and James, 
you know who you are. You also have 
had a very rough few days, working 
very hard on this. 
Congressman 
MICA’s 
staff 
also 
worked very hard, and they are very 
tough negotiators, but we were able to 
talk out our differences. It was not al-
ways pleasant to deal with it because 
people see things in different ways, but 
we got it done. 
We are not out of the woods yet in 
the sense that we do not have the bill 
before us. We are awaiting a decision 
made by the leaders as to when we will 
have this vote. But I would like to say 
that I believe, as I stand tonight, that 
really the work of the conference is 
completed, and that is very rewarding. 
The last thing I want to say is a huge 
thank you to the outside groups that 
have stood by my side this entire time. 
I tell you, I have had conference calls 
with them for months and months, 
sometimes four times a week, some-
times three times a week, sometimes 
six times a week, seriously, sometimes 
on Saturday, Fridays, Mondays—when-
ever we needed to touch base. This is 
an amazing coalition of people—work-
ers from organized labor, people from 
the construction trades. The chamber 
of commerce and AFL/CIO worked to-
gether. That is a rarity, you know, in 
today’s 
very 
difficult 
atmosphere 
where everyone is arguing over every-
thing—the granite people, the cement 
people. 
I want to say something to a gen-
tleman—I will not identify his name— 
who brought a couple of cement trucks. 
We had a rally. I think Senator BEGICH 
was there. After the rally, we were say-
ing: Pass the bill, get the bill done. I 
talked to this gentleman. He identified 
himself as a conservative Republican 
who is so much for this bill. One of the 
most touching things that happened 
was that he introduced me to two of 
his drivers who came over to meet me. 
As I stood there with these two gentle-
men and the owner of the business, I 
realized how much they were counting 
on us. 
What we do here matters. What we do 
here should matter. What we do here is 
literally life and death for the con-
struction industry, for the business end 
and for the workers. 
We know—our President and all of 
us—we all know this economic recov-
ery is too slow. One of the things that 
is weighing us down is the construction 
industry. One of the things that is 
weighing it down is the transportation 
sector. We know that if we do not do 
our job and we pass another extension 
here, that is a signal that the construc-
tion industry is going to suffer and suf-
fer mightily. We cannot have that. We 
are on the brink of getting this done. 
I know I have left out a lot of people 
I want to thank. I do not have really a 
written speech here in front of me. I 
will go back and I will correct the 
record if I left anyone out. But we are 
close to getting this done. Whether it 
is in the next few hours or more than a 
few hours, I believe we will get it done. 
All the people who brought us to this 
day—I should mention Senator REID, 
our majority leader, who never gave up 
even though I was—at one point, I am 
sure he was ducking me as I walked 
around because I would always say: 
Let’s keep going, Mr. Leader. And he 
did. He kept on going. 
When we went over to meet with 
Speaker BOEHNER was a very important 
moment, with Chairman MICA. It was 
important. I think it helped us at that 
point to realize that everyone did want 
to have a bill. 
I have to say that the Democrats in 
the House—I am sure it has been very 
difficult for them because they had so 
many priorities as well. But they were 
very clear, day after day, pushing hard 
for a bill, until finally everybody came 
together and passed some messages to 
the conferees that said: Get the job 
done. And everybody came together on 
that one—get the job done. 
For me personally, this has been a 
very important day. This is a day when 
I think we are very close to getting a 
transportation bill done. 
It is also a day that President Obama 
will forever remember, where the cen-
terpiece of his work was upheld as con-
stitutional by the Supreme Court. We 
all know we cannot go back to the days 
when people with preexisting condi-
tions suffered and could not get insur-
ance. We just cannot go back to the 
days when being a woman was consid-
ered a preexisting condition. It was im-
possible for her to get insurance. We 
cannot go back to the days when kids 
were thrown off their parents’ health 
insurance at 18. We can’t go back to

the days that seniors were going broke, 
having to choose between a drug that 
was lifesaving or having dinner that 
night. 
In my State, 6 million Californians 
are getting preventive services. They 
are 
getting 
mammograms, 
cancer 
screenings, and everything they need 
now because of this health care bill. 
There are 300,000-plus senior citizens 
who are getting help paying for their 
prescription drugs and 300,000 more stu-
dents who are now on their parents’ in-
surance. 
We are going to hear a lot of outrage 
about how this was bad for America. 
Let me just say that I thought today 
was a critical day for America. No 
piece of legislation is perfect. We will 
have to fix this, that, or the other in 
everything we do whether it is in a 
transportation bill or health care bill, 
but I think we need to move forward. 
We need to not go backward. We need 
to make sure that health care in Amer-
ica doesn’t become such an expensive 
burden for all of our people because it 
just drags down our families and it 
doesn’t enable them to do for their kids 
and for their moms and dads. 
So I think today was quite a day for 
the history books, and I look forward 
to working across the aisle in every-
thing we do here, whether it is trans-
portation or health care or anything 
else, to make life better for people, not 
to make it worse. I think if we all do 
that and if we listen to each other, we 
can get things done. 
I thank the Chair. 
I notice there is no one on the floor 
at this time, so I would note the ab-
sence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
HEALTH CARE DECISION 
Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I want 
to share a few thoughts about the Su-
preme Court’s ruling today and the sta-
tus of the health care bill. 
I believe the health care bill cannot 
be justified as written and will have to 
be changed. It will have to be repealed, 
and we have to start over. It is just 
that simple. 
As ranking member of the Budget 
Committee, I began to look at the 
numbers we have had. Our team is 
going to redouble their effort in the 
weeks to come so we can know pre-
cisely how much this legislation will 
cost. As that becomes more and more 
understood by the American people, it 
will be clear that we do not have the 
money to pass the bill. 
I know a lot of people are confident 
that it will undermine the right of an 
individual American to see the doctor 
of their choice, despite the President’s 
protestations. Even I believe today 
that people will not be able to continue 
to keep their insurance—at least not 
all people will be able to—and there 
will be other different problems. There 
is a real concern that under the legisla-
tion the quality of health care will go 
down. I believe that is accurate for a 
lot of reasons, and people like Dr. BAR-
RASSO and Dr. COBURN have explained 
that in great detail. 
As a member of the Budget Com-
mittee, I want to share some thoughts 
about the financing of the legislation 
to raise the issue of why we cannot go 
forward with it. 
The President promised the Amer-
ican people before a joint session of 
Congress, right down the hall in the 
House Chamber: ‘‘Now, add it all up, 
and the plan that I’m proposing will 
cost around $900 billion over 10 years.’’ 
Now, $900 billion is a lot of money, 
there is no doubt about that. He said 
that is how much it would cost over a 
10-year period. As we have all learned, 
that was a gimmicked-up number. It 
was fundamentally gimmicked up as a 
result of the fact that the cost of the 
bill where it begins to pay out money 
and will have real cost and the imple-
mentation of the bill was delayed 4 
years. So you take a 10-year window, 
and the bill is going to be out there for 
6 of those 10 years, and you announce it 
is only going cost $900 billion. 
That is not the right question, is it. 
The right question for the American 
people to actually understand the im-
pact of the legislation would be to ask 
how much it would cost over the first 
10 years of full implementation. That is 
what you should be asking. We all 
know that the numbers have come in 
on that. Under the CBO estimate 
strictly adhering only to the insurance 
portion of the bill, I believe they came 
in as saying not $900 billion but $1,400 
billion would be the cost over the first 
10 years, but the true cost of the health 
care bill is yet higher still. A complete 
and honest assessment of the cost of 
the President’s health care bill would 
include a full 10 years of spending 
starting in 2014. Adding up CBO’s esti-
mates for the different provisions in 
the bill, the President’s health care bill 
will amount to at least $2,600 billion— 
$2.6 trillion, not $900 billion. It is al-
most three times the estimated costs 
over the true 10-year period. Now, that 
is how we go broke in this country. 
That is how this country is going 
broke. We go through a whole debate, 
and the President insisted that is how 
much the bill was going to cost. 
When the Democrats had a filibuster- 
proof majority in the Senate, they had 
60 Democratic Senators, and they in-
sisted it was going to pay for itself. 
They said there was more revenue than 
needed to pay for the cost of the bill, so 
don’t worry about it, be happy. On 
Christmas Eve, without amendments 
and after much secret debate and a bill 
plopped on the floor, the bill was voted 
up or down, 60 votes to 40. Every single 
Democrat voted for it, and every single 
Republican voted against it. 
I just have to say that the first 10 
years of the bill is going to cost three 
times what was estimated. 
In addition to delaying the major 
spending provisions during the original 
window of the legislation, here are 
some of the other accounting gim-
micks, tricks, and maneuvers that the 
drafters used to manipulate the score 
the Congressional Budget Office gave 
to the bill, to manipulate how much 
they would say the bill cost and to hide 
its impact. 
Well, one of the most significant 
things is a double-counted $400 billion. 
Can you imagine that? The U.S. Gov-
ernment, according to the score manip-
ulation and the way it was done by the 
CBO, utilizing complex rules of the 
CBO to its advantage, the way it was 
analyzed, they double-counted $400 bil-
lion. So they cut Medicare expenses, 
they raised Medicare taxes, but they 
took the money and used it to fund the 
new bill and said they made Medicare 
more solvent. In some ways, we could 
argue they did make Medicare insol-
vent because the money that was spent 
on the health care bill was borrowed 
from Medicare. They are debt instru-
ments for Medicare. 
So my analysis of the legislation is 
that Medicare got a benefit, but there 
was no money for the health care bill. 
Yet they counted it as being $400 bil-
lion free to be spent without adding to 
the debt of the United States, but it 
does add to the debt. Medicare is going 
broke. Medicare is going to call the 
debt from the United States. It in-
creases the debt of the United States 
$400 
billion. 
It 
was 
counted 
both 
places—as income from Medicare and 
income available to be spent on the 
health care provision. That is a stun-
ning development. 
I got a letter from the head of the 
CBO the night before we voted, Decem-
ber 23, and he said, in effect—not in ef-
fect, I think this is a direct quote: It is 
double-counting the money, although 
the conventions of accounting might 
indicate otherwise. 
He told us in a letter before we voted 
that it was double-counting the money, 
but under the unified budget process 
rule that was utilized here, it didn’t 
score. 
In addition, they counted $70 billion 
of extra income that would come from 
the CLASS Act, which was designed for 
young people. The net result of that 
was that in the first decade or so of the 
CLASS Act’s implementation, healthy 
young people wouldn’t make many 
claims and there would be a surplus of 
$70 billion. But over 20, 30, 40 years, the 
CLASS Act goes into serious decline. 
Its actuarially unsound. It was referred 
to as a Ponzi scheme by the Demo-
cratic budget chairman, Senator CON-
RAD. Finally, the Secretary of HHS 
could not certify it as a sound pro-
gram, so $70 billion has been wiped off 
that as income available to be spent. 
They 
included—unrelated 
to 
this 
bill—student loan savings of $19 billion.

June 28, 2012 
They relied on off-budget Social Secu-
rity revenue for $29 billion, not scored 
toward the cost of the bill. 
They ignored the cost of imple-
menting the law. Imagine that. I mean, 
you have a bill. How much is it going 
to cost? It is going to cost $900 billion. 
Well, do you not score the cost of it? 
What about all these IRS agents? 
There will be 1,000-plus to 2,000 IRS 
agents who have to be hired and paid 
for, which is $115 billion not counted in 
the cost of the bill. Is this why we are 
going broke in this country? We score 
a bill, say it only costs $900 billion, and 
we have $115 billion of administrative 
costs not even counted. 
Then there was no permanent solu-
tion to the doctor reimbursement fig-
ure. To pay the doctors at the rate 
they needed to be paid—and I agree 
they need to be paid at this rate— 
would cost $208 billion over the current 
level of expected spending. If we don’t 
have this doc fix, as we call it, doctors 
would receive a 20-plus percent cut in 
pay for doing Medicare work imme-
diately. They are already paid less for 
Medicare work than they are paid for 
private insurance. Doctors would quit 
doing Medicare work if they took a 20- 
or 25-percent reduction in fee pay-
ments. That is $200 billion. That was 
one of the main reasons we were sup-
posed to have comprehensive health 
care reform, to deal permanently with 
this doctor fix that was being fixed 
every year, but not permanently. The 
bill didn’t do it. The bill never fixed it, 
therefore leaving a $208 billion hole in 
the plan that we have to find money 
for, and it is an essential part of all of 
that. 
So I would just say to my colleagues 
that this cost is unsustainable. It will 
put us on a debt course we cannot con-
tinue to be on. We are going to con-
tinue to look at the numbers, and I am 
going to ask people, if they desire, to 
come to the Senate floor and show me 
if I am wrong. Let me see where I am 
wrong. But I don’t think they can show 
that we are wrong because I and my 
staff are working as hard as we can to 
make sure what we say about the cost 
of this bill is accurate and fair. 
What does this do to the long-term 
debt of our country? That is a matter 
of great importance. One of the things 
our government does now is analyze 
the unfunded obligations of the U.S. 
Government. When we pass a law that 
says when everybody reaches a certain 
age, they get to draw a Social Security 
check of so much money, and it in-
creases on a percentage basis each 
year, that is an obligation of the 
United States. That is an entitlement 
program, we call it. People are entitled 
to that whether the government has 
any money to pay it. 
So the health care bill is an entitle-
ment. It has a guaranteed right for an 
individual American to receive certain 
subsidized health care benefits under 
this plan, and it is a permanent pro-
gram, but it doesn’t have a permanent 
source of income dedicated to paying 
for it in any significant fashion. So it 
creates what the Congressional Budget 
Office refers to as an unfunded liabil-
ity, unfunded obligations. To show 
Americans and Congress the true state 
of our long-term financial health, they 
do it over 75 years. It is not a perfect 
estimate, but it is a pretty good esti-
mate of whether the programs are ac-
tuarially sound and what they will do 
to the debt of America over 75 years. 
Under the numbers we have seen 
from the CBO and the work of our com-
mittee, it is pretty clear the health 
care bill that was passed by this Con-
gress will add $17 trillion to the un-
funded liabilities of the United States 
of America—$17 trillion—not a little 
amount of money, a huge amount of 
money. To give perspective on how 
large it is, the Social Security un-
funded liability over 75 years is only— 
only—$7 trillion. This is 21⁄2 times as 
large an unfunded liability addition to 
our government as Social Security, and 
we are wondering how we are going to 
save Social Security. It is more than 
half of the unfunded liabilities of Medi-
care or half of the unfunded liabilities 
of Medicare over 75 years. 
At a time when we have a serious 
demonstrated requirement that we re-
duce the unfunded liabilities of Medi-
care and Medicaid and Social Security, 
this bill would add $17 trillion to it. 
This is why every expert has told us 
this Nation is on an unsustainable 
course. 
The total unfunded liabilities before 
the passage of the health care bill were 
$65 trillion over 75 years. That trend, 
experts tell us, is unsustainable and 
threatens the future of our children 
and 
grandchildren. 
After 
the 
bill 
passes, it is $82 trillion. We don’t have 
the money to do health care reform in 
this way, with 2,700 pages and $17 tril-
lion in additional cost to the Treasury. 
We don’t need to affirm and repass leg-
islation that was said to cost $900 bil-
lion in the first 10 years. In truth, in 
the first 10 years of its obligation—be-
ginning the year after next—for the 
first 10 years it will cost almost three 
times that much—$2,600 billion. So it is 
a matter of great concern to me. 
As to the Court decision today, I am 
going to look at the Court decision and 
evaluate it. But I think it is additional 
proof that this health care legislation, 
from the beginning and in its en-
tirety—a 2,700-page Rube Goldberg con-
traption—will never work. It is further 
proof of that. 
Even the fundamental justification 
for the legislation that it was not a tax 
but a mandate has been rejected by the 
Court. The law was only upheld by say-
ing it is not a mandate. In effect, it is 
a tax that the sponsors of the bill di-
rectly said it was not. Indeed, the 
President said it was not a tax himself, 
directly. So certainly this opinion that 
allowed the legislation to stand, by the 
narrow margin of 5 to 4, in no way is an 
affirmation of the wisdom of the bill 
but is in fact demonstration that the 
people who cobbled it together and who 
rammed it through without full floor 
debate and amendments, that that 
scheme was flawed from the beginning 
and it will not work. 
Indeed, there are 1,700 references in 
that legislation to regulations to be 
issued by the Secretary of HHS. In 
other words, once the bill is passed, we 
will turn over huge sections of it to un-
known bureaucrats who will issue regu-
lations to administer this monstrosity. 
It is just not a practical and decent 
way to do business. 
So I believed the bill clearly violated 
the interstate commerce power granted 
to the Federal Government. The Fed-
eral Government can only act and pass 
legislation if it has been specifically 
authorized by the Constitution. One of 
the authorized powers was to regulate 
interstate commerce. But if a person is 
sitting on the creek bank in Alabama, 
not buying insurance, not partici-
pating, can he be made to buy a prod-
uct in interstate commerce when he is 
explicitly not participating in that? I 
didn’t believe it could be done, and the 
Court agreed. The Court rejected the 
Obama administration’s argument that 
it did. 
They said the Federal Government 
has no power to compel a person to 
participate in a commercial market 
when a person doesn’t participate. If a 
person participates, maybe they can 
regulate it. But if a person doesn’t par-
ticipate, they can’t tell a person to 
participate because this is a govern-
ment of limited power. 
It was a historic and important rul-
ing that the Supreme Court made 
clear: that there are limits to the 
power of the U.S. Government. I felt 
good about that. But now that Chief 
Justice Roberts and other members of 
the Court concluded that it may look 
like a mandate, but we call it a tax— 
and I haven’t done the technical anal-
ysis they went through to reach their 
opinion, but that doesn’t seem correct 
to me. It seems as though it is still a 
mandate, a mandate to buy something 
a person doesn’t want to buy. That 
doesn’t sound like a tax to me. Maybe 
it is. Maybe they can defend it that 
way, but I don’t see how that is a tax. 
It sounds like a mandate and a penalty. 
So scholars will be reading that opin-
ion for some time, and we will know 
whether Chief Justice Roberts an-
nounces that this apparent mandate, 
apparent requirement that the Presi-
dent said was not a tax, now it is a tax 
and the law is constitutional because 
of it. We will wrestle with that. But it 
does deal with the fundamental ques-
tion: Can we afford this legislation. I 
say we cannot. I believe the facts are 
crystal clear that we cannot. We abso-
lutely have to reform it, start over, 
create a health care system that works 
at a reasonable cost for the American 
people and does not burden our chil-
dren with exorbitant debt that could 
throw us into a debt crisis at most any 
time, and in the long term destabilize 
the health of the Nation we love so 
much.

June 28, 2012 
Fire, and although progress is being 
made in containing the fire, people are 
very concerned that the monsoons will 
soon drop rain on soil that can’t absorb 
the moisture. 
It makes little sense to punish home-
owners in communities who have not 
faced the kinds of flood risk they are 
currently presented due to the sudden 
devastation of nearby Federal forest 
land. 
I should also note that after con-
sultation with the Congressional Budg-
et Office, it is my understanding that 
this legislation does not score for budg-
et purposes. I appreciate the Banking 
Committee’s willingness to work with 
us on this issue. This legislation rep-
resents a critical step forward in pro-
viding access to Federal flood insur-
ance. The fire-stricken communities 
need help, and they need it now. 
By failing to include the LWCF Pro-
gram in the final conference report, I 
believe that we are squandering a crit-
ical opportunity to protect America’s 
precious natural resource lands and 
grow the economy. The Outdoor Indus-
try Association estimates that outdoor 
recreation is an overlooked economic 
giant, generating $646 billion in direct 
consumer spending, supporting 6.1 mil-
lion direct jobs, and producing $80 bil-
lion in Federal, State, and local tax 
revenue each year. This amount dwarfs 
total spending in other sectors such as 
pharmaceuticals and motor vehicles, 
which respectively account for $331 bil-
lion and $340 billion in direct spending. 
I am extremely disappointed that the 
final conference report did not include 
the bipartisan-supported LWCF Pro-
gram. This will hurt all Americans 
today and for generations to come. I 
urge my colleagues to come together 
and right this wrong. The benefits of 
the LWCF Program are clear and we 
owe it to the American people to pro-
vide funding for this essential and suc-
cessful program. 
Mr. President, I thank the Chair and 
yield the floor and note the absence of 
a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unan-
imous consent that the order for the 
quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
SURFACE TRANSPORTATION 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am dis-
mayed that the final conference report 
on the surface transportation reauthor-
ization bill did not include funding and 
continued authorization for the Land 
and Water Conservation Fund, LWCF, 
program, despite the fact that this pro-
vision was included in the Senate- 
passed bill. This short-sighted decision 
is counterproductive and ultimately, 
harmful to America. 
The LWCF program represents a 
promise that was made to the Amer-
ican people almost 50 years ago to in-
vest in conservation and outdoor recre-
ation. The LWCF Program has long 
been a successful bipartisan program 
that has touched all 50 States and 
nearly every county in America. I 
strongly believe that the LWCF provi-
sion, that was included in the Senate 
bill and which was passed in the Senate 
by a vote of 76 to 22, should have been 
included in the final conference report. 
Over the course of half a century, the 
LWCF program has protected natural 
resource lands, outdoor recreation op-
portunities, and working forests across 
America. The program is so successful, 
in fact, that every part of the LWCF 
Program is oversubscribed, with the 
demand 
for 
State 
and 
local 
rec-
reational needs, access for sportsmen, 
and working lands opportunities far ex-
ceeding the funds that have been avail-
able. 
The LWCF Program has been ex-
tremely important to Vermont. Two 
successful Vermont examples are the 
Green Mountain National Forest and 
the Silvio O. Conte National Wildlife 
Refuge. Among the most visited lands 
in the National Forest System, the 
Green Mountain National Forest has 
provided 
accessible 
and 
affordable 
recreation for millions of residents in 
the densely populated Northeast. Like-
wise, the Silvio O. Conte National 
Wildlife Refuge, which stretches across

ORDER OF BUSINESS 
Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am sorry 
it has taken so long. There are a lot of 
things to do around here. The con-
ference report has been filed. As I said 
earlier today, I appreciate very much 
the work of everyone, including our 
very hard-working staffs on both sides 
of the Capitol. But there is no need for 
us to wait anymore. We are not going 
to finish this tonight. We are going to 
have to come back tomorrow. 
I have talked to a number of people, 
and I wanted to make sure before any-
thing was announced that the papers 
had been filed. They have been. We 
have a number of issues we are trying 
to work through procedurally. We are 
not going to be able to do that tonight. 
I am not passing blame on anyone, be-
cause we all have a lot to do tomorrow, 
a lot of things that we are going to put 
on hold. This is a very big work period 
for us the next 10 days. I think it is ap-
propriate to say we will be back at 10 
o’clock in the morning to finish this 
legislation and do it as quickly as we 
can. We do not know what time the 
House is going to vote on this tomor-
row, but we may have to wait now 
until they pass it. That is one of the 
pieces we are working on. We have 
done our very best to try to complete 
everything tonight, but we are not 
going to be able to do that. 
I am disappointed. I heard that from 
many people, how disappointed they 
are that we could not move further 
FLOOD INSURANCE 
Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, on 
June 20, I introduced a bill to authorize 
the FEMA administrator to waive the 
30-day waiting period for flood insur-
ance policies purchased for private 
properties affected by wildfire on Fed-
eral lands. Senators TOM UDALL, MARK 
UDALL, and MICHAEL BENNET are co-
sponsors of this legislation. 
As we speak, wildfires are burning 
across the Western states and it is crit-
ical that we take immediate steps to 
protect communities against the tragic 
consequences of flooding. To this end, I 
am pleased that the Senate included 
this legislation in the National Flood 
Insurance 
Program 
reauthorization 
bill, which we will be voting on later 
today or tomorrow. 
Flooding is the most common and 
costly natural disaster in the United 
States. In 1968, Congress created the 
National Flood Insurance Program to 
help provide a means for property own-
ers to financially protect themselves. 
The Act, however, requires a 30-day 
waiting period before coverage under a 
new contract for flood insurance can 
take effect. This is to prevent individ-
uals from delaying until the last 
minute to purchase insurance when the 
risk of flooding is high. 
Unfortunately, today’s large cata-
strophic wildfires in the West can alter 
the watershed conditions on our for-
ested Federal lands so rapidly that 
nearby communities find themselves in 
flood hazard areas that didn’t exist the 
day before. The heat of the fires can 
make 
the 
ground 
impermeable 
to 
water, which significantly increases 
runoff when rainfall comes. 
In some cases, the U.S. Forest Serv-
ice will advise a community to pur-
chase 
flood 
insurance 
immediately 
after a wildfire is put out, only to see 
that community flooded by a few 
inches of rainfall weeks before the 30- 
day wait period has lapsed. When this 
happens, homeowners are tragically 
without any flood insurance coverage. 
Every year States throughout the 
U.S. deal with the devastating con-
sequences of wildfires. Firefighters are 
currently battling several major fires 
in New Mexico, including the largest 
fire in the State’s history. Over 340,000 
acres in the Gila and Lincoln National 
Forest have been burned and over 
100,000 acres have been burned in Colo-
rado leaving thousands of residents 
struggling to cope with the aftermath 
and the risk that flooding presents. 
While our immediate concern is 
fighting these wildfires, we need to 
take steps to protect communities 
against the tragic consequences of 
flooding. In fact, in the area of the 
Whitewater-Baldy Fire, though the 
damage from the fire is extensive, the 
damage caused to property and risk to 
life is expected to be far greater from 
the associated flooding despite the 
mitigation and prevention efforts in 
progress. Recently, I joined Secretary 
Vilsack and Forest Service Chief Tid-
well for a briefing on the Little Bear

down the road. But that is the way it 
is. 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, would the 
leader yield for a question? 
Mr. REID. I would be happy to yield. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Vermont. 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I know 
the distinguished majority leader has 
been working very hard to accommo-
date Senators in a vote. I know he has 
the support of every member of our 
caucus in doing that. I believe I heard 
the distinguished leader say we will 
come in at 10. 
Mr. REID. Yes. If I thought it would 
help to come in earlier, I would do 
that. But it would only be—— 
Mr. LEAHY. The Senator anticipated 
my next question. I appreciate that. 
Mr. REID. We likely cannot do any-
thing until the House votes on the bill 
tomorrow. We are trying to work 
through that. I have to say, the House 
has been extremely cooperative in ev-
erything we have done the last few 
days. I see on the floor my friend, the 
chairman of the Environment and Pub-
lic Works Committee. She knows how 
hard this has been and how cooperative 
the Republicans have been. No one has 
been more so than the ranking member 
of the Environment and Public Works 
Committee, JIM INHOFE. I will always 
admire JIM INHOFE for the manner in 
which he approached this important 
piece of legislation. We pass out acco-
lades on this floor, about everyone, 
how hard they work, but we would not 
be able to get this bill done except for 
JIM INHOFE. Fact. 
So I am disappointed we cannot do 
this tonight. As the chairman of the 
Judiciary Committee just said, we 
would stay here tonight on our side 
until the wee hours of the morning, be-
cause we have some things to do. I was 
scheduled to be in Lake Tahoe tomor-
row, but I can’t be there. Other people 
have certainly more important trips 
than that. But it is one of the issues we 
have to face with these jobs we have, 
which are a tremendous privilege, but 
sometimes we do not have the ability, 
as a Governor does or the President 
does, a member of the Court does, to 
say: This is the schedule. There are 100 
different leaders here, each thinking 
they have the best way of solving the 
problems of the world, and it takes a 
while sometimes to work through their 
opinions.

MORNING BUSINESS 
Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unan-
imous consent that the Senate proceed 
to a period of morning business, with 
Senators permitted to speak therein 
for up to 10 minutes.

ROCK ISLAND ARSENAL’S 150TH 
ANNIVERSARY 
Mr. DURBIN. I rise today to cele-
brate a major milestone for Illinois and 
the nation. One hundred and fifty years 
ago on July 11, 1862, Illinois’ own Presi-
dent Lincoln signed an Act of Congress 
that established the Rock Island Arse-
nal. 
Rock Island started out during the 
Civil War as a small Union prisoner of 
war camp which also held and distrib-
uted supplies. It has grown into a crit-
ical manufacturer of 21st century sup-
plies for our troops in the field. And in 
doing so, it also serves as the lifeblood 
of the Quad Cities region that hosts it. 
In celebration of its 150th anniver-
sary, I would like to highlight Rock Is-
land Arsenal’s impressive history and 
the impact it has had on the commu-
nity and the nation. 
Rock Island has a long history of pro-
ducing supplies for our military. It was 
rifle cartridges and siege howitzers in 
the Spanish-American War of 1898. In 
World War I, it was rifles and a variety 
of personal equipment. By World War 
II, the Arsenal’s emphasis had shifted 
to artillery production, and workers in-
creased production from 75 artillery 
cartridges a year to 600 a month during 
the war. This ability to rise to the 
challenge for our servicemembers is a 
theme at Rock Island. 
Products weren’t the only thing 
changing at the Arsenal. So were de-
mographics. Everyone is familiar with 
the image of Rosie the Riveter, as 
women stepped into the workforce. The 
Arsenal was no different—32 percent of 
the workforce was female during World 
War II. 
Yet some of the workers were only 
teenagers. Squeezing in 40 hours of 
work while going to school, students 
were picked up after class and bused to 
the island. They worked Saturdays too. 
In a not uncommon story, Arsenal 
worker Anna Mae said her wartime ef-
fort was a family affair. ‘‘My mom 
worked on one side of the island, my 
stepdad on the other and I was in the 
middle.’’ 
Years after the war ended, Anna Mae 
returned to work at the Arsenal until 
retirement. When she learned that her 
war efforts contributed to her pension, 
she articulated the selflessness of so 
many when she said, ‘‘I never would 
have thought (about) that—we were 
just trying to win a war.’’ 
In the Korean War/Conflict, the sense 
of urgency on the island returned. 
Crews worked 10-hour days, 6 days a 
week, and sometimes on Sunday to get 
weapons and equipment shipped out. 
For Vietnam, the Arsenal created new 
products designed to counteract the 
Viet Cong’s guerilla ‘‘hit and run’’ tac-
tics, such as the M102 lightweight how-
itzer. The Arsenal continued to con-
tribute to systems that meant life or 
death for the soldiers for the 1991 Gulf 
War—and then adapted as the military 
went through a drawdown after the war 
ended. 
But as we all know, that peace did 
not last long. A little more than 10 
years ago, the attacks of September 
11th changed our world—and the nation 
again found itself at war. Again to 
their credit, the Arsenal workforce 
went into overdrive to provide our 
troops what they needed. Machinist 
Jeff 
Roberts 
recalled, 
‘‘Everyone’s 
mentality is it’s one collaborative ef-
fort to get the soldiers what they need 
as fast as you can.’’ 
They did—in a unique way. The Arse-
nal has the Department of Defense’s 
only vertically integrated metal manu-
facturing capability. It has the only re-
maining foundry in the U.S. Army. It 
means that raw materials can go in one 
side and come out the other as very in-
tricate finished products. It does this 
with a number of materials, including 
stainless steel, carbon steels, and tita-
nium. The result—new equipment to 
better protect our troops, especially on 
short notice. 
We all know how devastating impro-
vised explosive devices (IEDs) were to 
U.S. troops in Iraq and continue to be 
to servicemembers in Afghanistan. In 
2006 and 2007, our nation had fallen 
short in armor kits for Humvees and 
other ground vehicles to protect our 
troops. I urged then-Secretary Gates to 
use Rock Island’s production capability 
to get these kits to our troops faster. 
Secretary Gates agreed. Rock Island 
became the single largest producer of 
these armor kits. Talk about saving 
lives. 
Lieutenant General Raymond Mason, 
Army’s Deputy Chief of Staff for Logis-
tics, recently noted, ‘‘It was critical 
that we had (the organic industrial 
base), along with our manufacturing 
capabilities 
at 
our 
arsenals 
at 
Watervliet, Rock Island and Pine Bluff. 
This allowed us to expand for wartime 
demand . . . ‘‘ He also added, ‘‘By en-
suring we maintain a core level of 
work, we then retain expandability ca-
pabilities if something else happens in 
the world.’’ 
As I look to the future, I would say 
that is exactly what we are doing at 
Rock Island. Earlier this year, I intro-
duced the Army Arsenal Strategic 
Workload Enhancement Act of 2012, 
with the support of Senator MARK 
KIRK, Senator GRASSLEY, Senator HAR-
KIN, and the Senators from New York 
and Arkansas. 
The bill does just what General 
Mason was describing. It would create 
a strategic plan to ensure arsenals re-
ceive the workload they need to keep 
workers’ skills sharp for whatever the 
future may hold. 
We worked with Senator LEVIN and 
Senator MCCAIN on this. I was pleased 
that major portions of our bill were in-
cluded in the report accompanying the 
National Defense Authorization Act, 
which was voted out of the Armed 
Services Committee last month. 
But the Arsenal isn’t complacent. 
They are partnering with private in-
dustry interested in working with tita-
nium and other lightweight metals at 
the 
Quad-City 
Manufacturing 
Lab 
which opened in 2010. In these times of 
tough budget decisions, these partner-
ships enable Rock Island to sustain 
itself at no cost to the government

adversity 
is 
a 
testament 
to 
the 
strength of the greatest military in the 
world. We are proud to honor our vet-
erans, active duty soldiers, and mili-
tary families for their grave sacrifices 
made for the safety and security of this 
great nation. 
Next week, as we gather with family 
and friends, let us reflect on the trials 
and tribulations of our nation’s path to 
independence and the everlasting im-
pact of this defining moment in Amer-
ica’s history. With appreciation for the 
freedoms we enjoy today, I ask my col-
leagues to join me in commemorating 
the birth of our Nation’s independence.

through a Working Capital Fund. Just 
like the private sector, the Arsenal is 
out there competing for work—and 
winning it. They have signed agree-
ments with Sivyer Steel, Mack Defense 
and others. 
But Rock Island is about more than 
just production—it is also the bedrock 
of the Quad-City region as the area’s 
largest employer. One example of fam-
ily commitment to the Arsenal is Jeff 
Roberts, a machinist at Rock Island. 
His great-great-great-great grandfather 
was a master carpenter at Rock Island 
in the 1860s and helped build the is-
land’s iconic Clock Tower. Working at 
the Arsenal for our men and women in 
uniform 
gave 
Jeff a clear under-
standing of, as he described it, ‘‘what 
you’re doing and why you’re doing it.’’ 
He added, ‘‘I’ve never had the job satis-
faction I have now until I came here.’’ 
Jeff’s experience is replicated all 
across the Arsenal. The island has 
more than 70 military and private sec-
tor organizations as tenants. Over the 
years, the Arsenal has welcomed the 
Army 
Corps 
of 
Engineers, 
Army 
Sustainment Command, Joint Muni-
tions Command, and Army Contracting 
Command, among others. Most re-
cently, Rock Island welcomed the 
headquarters for First Army, which is 
in charge of mobilizing, training and 
deploying our Army Reservists. It may 
not always have the glitz of a front- 
page story. But their collective dedica-
tion shows how central Rock Island is 
to the support of our military, every 
day. 
Rock Island Arsenal is a large and vi-
brant installation, with a rich history 
and an impressive array of ongoing ac-
tivities. Rock Island Arsenal has made 
remarkable contributions over the past 
150 years. It has served us through our 
difficult times and will continue to do 
so in the future. 
I thank those who serve at the Arse-
nal today and those who have served in 
the past. And also to those who have 
join me in honoring Rock Island Arse-
nal in its 150-year anniversary celebra-
tion.

CONGRATULATING THE 2012 
NATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to 
commend three outstanding Vermont 
companies that were recently singled 
out for recognition at the 2012 Fancy 
Food Show in Washington, D.C. These 
vendors were among the select 110 Sil-
ver Finalists for the show’s coveted 
Specialty Outstanding Food Innova-
tion, sofi, gold awards, widely consid-
ered to be one of the top honors in the 
specialty 
food 
industry. 
The 
sofi 
Awards, from the National Association 
for the Specialty Food Trade (NASFT), 
recognize the best in specialty food and 
beverage and are a coveted industry 
honor. This year’s contest was the 
most competitive in the history of the 
awards, with a record 2,520 entries. 
Two of the vendors, Vermont Butter 
and 
Cheese 
Creamery, 
located 
in 
Websterville, and Big Picture Farm 
L3C, located in Townshend, won the 
gold sofi in their categories, while 
Grafton Village Cheese, located in 
Grafton, represented Vermont proudly 
as a finalist in the category for out-
standing cheese or dairy products for 
their new cheese, Cave Aged Leyden. 
Vermont Butter and Cheese Cream-
ery’s owners, Allison Hooper and Bob 
Reese, deserve well-earned congratula-
tions for winning three gold sofi 
Awards, including Best Product Line, 
Best Cheese or Dairy Product for their 
aged goat cheese Bonne Bouche, and 
Best Perishable Food Service Product 
for their Sea Salt Crystal Cultured 
Butter. Allison and Bob’s extraor-
dinary achievement demonstrates, be-
yond a doubt, that Vermont Butter and 
Cheese Creamery has succeeded at 
building a high quality, superior brand 
that reflects the values and ethos of 
Vermont. 
Congratulations are due as well to 
Big Picture Farm’s owners, Louisa 
Conrad and Lucas Farrell, for winning 
a gold sofi Award in the Confectionary 
Category for their Farmstead Goat 
Milk Caramels. When I met this young 
couple last week, I was taken with 
their energy and excitement for both 
their goats and their award winning 
caramels. Earlier this year, Louisa and 
Lucas received a U.S. Department of

INDEPENDENCE DAY 2012 
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I 
rise today to commemorate our Na-
tion’s Independence Day. 
Over 230 years ago, a collection of 
very brave and thoughtful men put 
their names and lives on the line to 
support a visionary idea, writing: 
We hold these truths to be self-evident, 
that all men are created equal, that they are 
endowed by their Creator with certain 
unalienable rights, that among these are 
Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. 
That to secure these rights, governments are 
instituted among men, deriving their just 
powers from the consent of the governed. 
Today we honor those patriots who 
crafted our country’s identity, and we 
appreciate every man, woman, and 
child who has shared it, refined it, and 
lived it. There is a reason why the rest 
of the world looks to America as a bold 
leader, and it began in Philadelphia on 
July 4, 1776. It continues nationwide 
today in our independent spirit, our 
ambition, and our sense of generosity, 
and we certainly see that in my home 
State of Alaska. 
We see it in communities large and 
small, as we solve problems and work 
together to make life better and the fu-
ture brighter. Today, we take a mo-
ment to realize that we do all this 
without thinking about it—and that 
few other countries in the world can 
boast the same. 
But as we take a moment to appre-
ciate all that we have, we must never 
forget the cost of freedom. Thousands 
have given their lives to secure the 
blessings of liberty. Men and women in 
uniform are serving bravely overseas, 
enduring tremendous sacrifice, while 
countless others guard our shores, pro-
tect our interests abroad, and defend 
our skies here at home. Their burden is 
shared by the families who endure 
empty spots at the dinner table, missed 
birthdays, and absence from special 
moments like a child’s first steps. 
Freedom is indeed perishable and we 
are grateful for those who safeguard 
our liberty for our children and grand-
children. 
As Americans, we honor our veterans 
and the freedoms they defend. We 
speak our minds and we think big 
thoughts—bounded only by the limits 
of our imagination. 
On this Independence Day, I am hon-
ored to represent Alaska in the United 
States Senate. 
Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, I rise 
today in the tradition of patriotic cele-
bration to recognize 236 years of Amer-
ican independence. The Fourth of July 
is not only a proud and inspiring sym-
bol of our nation’s independence, but of 
our undeniable strength and unity. As 
we celebrate Independence Day this 
year, I am thankful for our forefathers’ 
struggle to afford us freedom and lib-
erty which we enjoy today. 
As the first battles of the Revolu-
tionary War broke out in April 1775, 
many colonists were skeptical of com-
plete independence from Great Britain. 
By the middle of the following year, 
tensions and hostility were high. As 
revolutionary sentiment spread, so too 
did the colonists’ desire to become lib-
erated from Great Britain. 
On July 2, 1776, the Continental Con-
gress voted in favor of a resolution for 
independence. Two days later, our 
Founding Fathers adopted the Declara-
tion of Independence, marking the 
United States’ break with Great Brit-
ain. In 1870, the U.S. Congress insti-
tuted July 4th as a federal holiday. As 
Americans, we are proud to celebrate 
this important national holiday, a 
symbol of our patriotism and freedom. 
On the eve of this celebration, we 
also pay tribute to today’s heroes; 
America’s brave men and women in 
uniform who have fought tirelessly to 
protect and preserve the very freedom 
afforded to us by our Founding Fa-
thers. Their perseverance in the face of

and expand their business plan. The 
Value Added Producer Grant, together 
with Big Picture Farm’s hard work and 
commitment to their vision, helped to 
catapult this new business to a sofi 
Award after less than two years in 
business. That is quite an achievement. 
I can’t wait to see what challenges this 
young couple will tackle next. 
Recognition should go, too, to Bob 
Allen, Christine Damour, and Wendy 
Levy, co-owners of Grafton Village 
Cheese. This year, Grafton Village 
Cheese was a sofi finalist in the cat-
egory of Outstanding Cheese or Dairy 
Products. Vermont Butter and Cheese 
Creamery also competed in this cat-
egory and to have not one, but two 
great Vermont companies competing as 
finalists in the same category is an 
outstanding 
achievement 
for 
any 
State, much less one as small as 
Vermont. 
I always enjoy seeing Vermonters in 
Washington, and was pleased to visit 
them at the 2012 Fancy Food Show. 
These companies create Vermont jobs 
and grow Vermont’s economy. During 
these tough economic times, this kind 
of work is vital to restoring the Amer-
ican way of life and getting the coun-
try back on track. I am extremely 
proud of the hard work, dedication, en-
trepreneurial spirit, and innovation of 
these exceptional Vermont companies. 
f 
Already, we have seen a change in 
how VA and the DoD treat PTSD. Ear-
lier this year, we learned that hundreds 
of servicemembers and veterans had 
their PTSD diagnoses reversed over the 
course of 5 years at Madigan Army 
Medical Center in my home State of 
Washington. In the wake of this shock-
ing discovery, Secretary of the Army 
John McHugh ordered a comprehen-
sive, Army-wide review of medical files 
from the past decade to uncover any 
other problems with misdiagnoses. Two 
weeks ago, Secretary Panetta an-
nounced that he would be ordering a 
similar review across all of the armed 
services. I applaud these actions taken 
by Secretary Panetta and Secretary 
McHugh, but we are a long way from 
winning the battle on mental and be-
havioral health conditions. 
That is why earlier this week I intro-
duced the Mental Health ACCESS Act 
of 2012. This bill will require VA and 
DoD to offer a range of supplemental 
mental and behavioral health services 
to ensure that veterans, servicemem-
bers, and their families are receiving 
the care that they need and deserve. 
The Mental Health ACCESS Act of 2012 
provides for comprehensive standard-
ized suicide prevention programs, ex-
panded eligibility to families for sup-
port services, improved training for 
healthcare providers, new peer-to-peer 
counseling opportunities, and reliable 
measures for mental health services. 
Finally, we must overcome the stig-
ma that surrounds PTSD. As VA’s Na-
tional Center for PTSD has dem-
onstrated, once diagnosed, PTSD and 
its symptoms can be treated and those 
who suffer from it can resume healthy 
and productive lives. Efforts like Na-
tional PTSD Awareness Day and PTSD 
Awareness Month are critical to com-
bating some of the most damaging 
misperceptions about PTSD. 
In closing, as we look back on our ef-
forts to raise awareness of PTSD 
throughout the month, we must also 
reaffirm our commitment to those vet-
erans, servicemembers, and families af-
fected by PTSD. Our veterans and serv-
icemembers have made tremendous 
sacrifices for us and our country and 
we owe them the support and care that 
they deserve.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
pended on migrants coming from the 
East. Some traveled on famous emi-
grant trails like the Oregon and Cali-
fornia Trails. But many followed the 
train tracks as the transcontinental 
railroad forged a new path across the 
West. The transcontinental railroad 
had particular importance in Wyo-
ming’s development. Steam engines 
needed water-refilling stations, and 
these stations quickly became hubs of 
commerce in the State. Evanston was 
the Union Pacific’s last stop in Wyo-
ming, and its settlement depended on 
the railroad. 
In 1868, tracks finally reached Evans-
ton, and a town of tents cropped up 
around the station. This prosperity was 
only short-lived because the managers 
soon ordered the station to be moved 12 
miles west to Wasatch. Because of the 
transfer, the town’s population dis-
appeared virtually overnight. Evanston 
was in danger of becoming another 
‘‘end of the line’’ town. Fortunately, 
the station moved back to Evanston 
later 
that 
summer—and 
it 
stayed 
there. The railroad provided a stable 
job base and nearby coal mines encour-
aged the settlement of the town. Just 
as the railroad depended on its work-
ers, the town depended on the trains. 
Evanston enjoyed great success as a 
water-filling station. The increased 
production and prosperity of the Union 
Pacific warranted new facilities to ac-
commodate its increased traffic. In 
1871, a new roundhouse and a shop com-
plex were constructed. The station was 
designated as the major Union Pacific 
maintenance facility between Green 
River, WY, and Ogden, UT. In the next 
30 years, the station prospered and the 
town of Evanston expanded. In 1912, the 
Union Pacific approved additional up-
grades. The construction included a 
new 
roundhouse, 
a 
state-of-the-art 
turntable, and electricity for the other 
buildings in the complex. 
Many technological advances eventu-
ally caught up with the station’s suc-
cess. The advent of diesel train engines 
brought the slow demise of the ma-
chine shop in Evanston, as more and 
more services were moved to Green 
River. In 1927, main operations were 
moved to Green River and the Evans-
ton station opened as a reclamation 
plant. Here, rolling train stock and 
parts were repaired and refurbished for 
the Union Pacific. The new designation 
created a new era of success for the 
station. At its height of production, 
the plant employed over 300 men, mak-
ing it the largest employer in Evans-
ton. The roundhouse and its accom-
panying facilities were crucial to the 
economic independence of the town’s 
residents. 
The success of the reclamation plant 
was enjoyed for several decades. How-
ever, in 1971, the Union Pacific closed 
the facility for good, due to modern 
production methods and lower prices 
for new equipment. The community 
had developed a strong tie to the rail-
road. Evanston depended on the rail-
road not only for jobs or economic sta-
bility, but also for its identity. After 
NATIONAL PTSD AWARENESS DAY 
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am 
honored to join my colleagues today in 
recognizing the Department of Vet-
erans Affairs’ National Center for Post- 
Traumatic Stress Disorder, PTSD, as 
their 
month-long 
PTSD 
awareness 
campaign comes to a close and in re-
flecting on our participation in the 
third annual National PTSD Awareness 
Day. I thank Senator CONRAD for intro-
ducing the resolution to honor Army 
National Guard SSG Joe Biel who suf-
fered from PTSD and tragically took 
his own life in April 2007 after return-
ing from his second tour in Iraq. 
All this month, we draw attention to 
PTSD which affects millions of Ameri-
cans at some point in their lives. As 
chairman of the Senate Veterans’ Af-
fairs Committee, I am especially con-
cerned with the impact that PTSD has 
had on our Nation’s servicemembers 
and veterans. The number of veterans 
treated by the Department of Veterans 
Affairs, VA, for PTSD or related symp-
toms has reached 475,000 and there are 
likely more cases that go unreported, 
undiagnosed, or untreated each year. 
In fact, as the drawdown of Afghani-
stan troops continues, we can only ex-
pect those numbers to follow the 
steady rise previously reported. VA and 
the Department of Defense, DoD, need 
to be ready now. 
This unpreparedness is a tragedy. 
Whether the wounds they return home 
with are visible or invisible, no veteran 
should be left to face their injuries 
alone, and I am committed to seeing 
that they never have to. 
RECOGNIZING EVANSTON 
ROUNDHOUSE AND RAIL YARDS 
∑ Mr. 
BARRASSO. 
Mr. 
President, 
today I wish to recognize the 100th an-
niversary of the Evanston Roundhouse 
and Rail Yards. This impressive site, 
which is listed on the National Reg-
ister of Historic Places, is a lasting 
landmark and a national treasure. 
Evanston is truly a special place, and 
the railroad has had a huge impact on 
its history. In fact, Evanston would not 
exist today had it not been for the rail-
road. Like the rest of the area, a large 
part of Wyoming’s development de-

tively solved problems and improved 
the lives of countless people. 
The vision of United Way has re-
mained constant since 1887 when Den-
ver, CO, community members recog-
nized the importance of cooperation to 
address the welfare problems in the 
city. Those efforts laid the foundation 
for the help it provides to communities 
all over the world today. 
I am particularly proud of United 
Way’s efforts in Arkansas and the sup-
port of people all over the State to help 
fellow Arkansans. I know many Arkan-
sans join in efforts to help improve the 
well-being of their neighbors through 
various campaigns to mobilize re-
sources and strengthen educational, 
employment, and health opportunities. 
We are blessed to have great commu-
nity involvement and an organization 
like United Way that is always looking 
for new problems to solve. This is truly 
an amazing program that makes its 
presence count in untold by ways 
touching lives and creating lasting 
changes. 
On this 125th anniversary, on behalf 
of the people of Arkansas, I offer my 
thanks for impacting positive changes 
in the lives of people worldwide and 
close to home. I am humbled by United 
Way’s constant commitment and at-
tention to developing a bright future 
for all citizens. It is a privilege to have 
United Way in our backyard, and we 
are grateful for its outreach. United 
Way serves as an inspiration for all of 
us, showing us what hard work, dedica-
tion, and partnerships can lead to. 
Thank you for bringing hope to the 
hopeless, help to the helpless, voice to 
the voiceless and bridging the gaps be-
tween people and resources. Congratu-
lations on this great milestone.∑

GILBY, NORTH DAKOTA 
∑ Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am 
pleased to honor a community in North 
Dakota that will soon celebrate its 
125th anniversary. On July 14, 2012, the 
town of Gilby will recognize their com-
munity’s history and founding. 
Founded in 1887, Gilby was named for 
John Gilby Jr., who came to the area 
in 1878. The rich soil has made it pos-
sible for farms to thrive in the area, 
growing wheat, soybeans, corn, sugar 
beets, and edible beans. The Scott 
farm, the oldest farm in Gilby, has 
been growing crops since the early 
1800s. The Oppegard building has been a 
prominent landmark in Gilby since the 
town was established, starting out as a 
blacksmith’s 
shop. 
Currently, 
the 
Oppegard building is home to an inde-
pendent repair shop serving the needs 
of farmers in the area. The people of 
this friendly town are predominantly 
from German heritage. 
To celebrate its 125th anniversary, 
Gilby is collaborating with Midway’s 
50th All School reunion on July 12, and 
Forest River’s 125th anniversary on 
July 13. The activities culminate with 
Gilby’s 125 celebration on July 14. 
Events in Gilby will include a pie and 
ice cream social, a volleyball tour-
nament, train rides, and a parade. 
I ask the United States Senate to 
join me in congratulating Gilby, ND, 
and its residents on the 125th anniver-
sary of their founding and in wishing 
them a bright future.∑ 
f 
its final closure, the Union Pacific do-
nated the rail yards to the community, 
creating the perfect opportunity for 
the community to preserve the sta-
tion’s 
legacy. 
Local 
businessmen 
formed a coalition to develop the area. 
The city of Evanston leased the facility 
to a number of railway companies 
while they created a comprehensive 
plan to preserve the roundhouse and 
rail yards. 
To honor and recognize the signifi-
cant impact of the roundhouse and the 
railroad, community members turned 
their eyes to restoration and preserva-
tion. This historic site was listed on 
the 
National 
Register 
of 
Historic 
Places in 1985. This special designation 
prompted other city officials to create 
a plan for the preservation and renova-
tion of the rail yards. In 1998, thanks to 
Federal funding and the fundraising ef-
forts of the community, cleanup of the 
facilities began. The goal to preserve 
the structural and historical integrity 
of 
the 
facility 
was 
accomplished 
through the cooperation and passion of 
the entire community. 
Today, the Evanston Roundhouse and 
Rail Yards are open to the public. The 
recently dedicated J.T. & Phyllis Pat-
terson Visitor Center welcomes visitors 
from across the country. In addition to 
the restoration of the original round-
house, community leaders are working 
to restore the original turntable and 
other facilities around the plaza. Now, 
the machine shop is a clean, updated 
facility that is perfect for hosting 
events and meetings. And Evanston has 
a vision for what might follow. In the 
future, the city plans to move its city 
hall into the complex. Other ideas in-
clude plans to install a renovated din-
ing car and to move the original water 
tower from Wasatch to the rail yards. 
Evanston and its visitors will continue 
to enjoy the rich history of the round-
house thanks to the innovation of city 
officials and Evanston’s partnership 
with local, State, and Federal agencies. 
The Evanston Roundhouse and Rail 
Yards is a remarkable part of Wyo-
ming’s history. In honor of its 100th an-
niversary, I invite my colleagues to 
visit this national treasure. This site is 
a visible reminder of the important 
role the railroad played in the growth 
and development of Evanston. I con-
gratulate the citizens who have worked 
so hard to preserve the roundhouse. 
They should be proud to share this his-
toric place with visitors from all over 
the world.∑

CONGRATULATING NORMAN 
DIANDA 
∑ Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, today I 
wish 
to 
congratulate 
Mr. 
Norman 
‘‘Norm’’ Dianda, who was recognized as 
the 2012 Reno Rodeo Parade Grand 
Marshal. My home State of Nevada is 
proud and privileged to acknowledge 
such an extraordinary civic leader. 
Since founding Q&D Construction in 
1964, Norm has been committed to 
making the Truckee Meadows a great 
place to live. He has served as the 
heart and soul of the company by con-
tinually going above and beyond the 
call of duty each year, assisting numer-
ous organizations for the betterment of 
the Silver State. 
A native Nevadan, Norm has volun-
teered his time to organizations such 
as the American Heart Association,

MILTON, NORTH DAKOTA 
∑ Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am 
pleased to honor a community in North 
Dakota that will soon celebrate its 
125th anniversary. On July 14th, 2012, 
the residents of Milton will recognize 
the community’s history and founding. 
When Milton was founded in 1887, the 
postmaster initially suggested that the 
town be called Springfield. Some histo-
rians claim the town was named after 
the famous English poet, John Milton. 
However, most historians agree the 
town was named for Milton, Ontario, 
the hometown of pioneer settler Steven 
Sophar. Steven Sophar was instru-
mental in obtaining land and creating 
townships across North Dakota, as well 
as in several other northern states. 
After establishing a post office, Milton 
reached its boom in population during 
the 1890s. 
The dedication of the residents keeps 
the community vibrant through its 
events and businesses. The local eleva-
tor, Little Star Theater and Milton 
Cafe´ are focal points in the commu-
nity. Farming is also a thriving indus-
try, due to the rich soil in the area. 
Organized by local residents, the city 
is celebrating its 125th anniversary on

After 12 years as president, Rick 
Craig is leaving America First Credit 
Union on solid financial foundation. He 
has been successful at navigating the 
credit union through very turbulent fi-
nancial times. 
Although Rick Craig has achieved

first hand the successes achieved by 
Nebraska’s United Way offices, which 
have improved the lives of countless 
citizens across the State. I couldn’t be 
more proud of their work. 
It is an honor to mark this special 
day by acknowledging United Way of-
fices across our State and thanking the 
many volunteers who contribute time, 
talent, and financial resources to im-
prove Nebraska communities. I wish all

charitable work in the community is 
admirable. For 9 of the past 13 years, 
Norm was voted Contractor of the Year 
by his peers in northern Nevada. He 
truly is one of the best. 
Recently, Norm was honored with 
the privilege of leading the Reno Rodeo 
Parade. Having attended and supported 
the Reno Rodeo for over 60 years, Norm 
has seen and experienced many changes 
in the community and the rodeo itself. 
His company has been instrumental in 
updating the rodeo grounds for years. 
Norm’s love for Nevada, community 
service, and the Reno Rodeo are un-
matched. 
Nevada’s economy relies on events 
such as the Reno Rodeo, which cele-
brated its 93rd anniversary this year. 
Dependent upon nearly 400 volunteers 
from across the Truckee Meadows, the 
event is said to have an economic im-
pact of $42 million in the Reno/Sparks 
area. This 10-day rodeo recognizes the 
passions and skills of some of the 
world’s top professional cowboys and 
cowgirls and their contributions to the 
sport of rodeo. 
I admire and recognize Norm’s com-
mitment to northern Nevada. His dedi-
cation serves as a constant reminder of 
the importance of giving back to our 
communities. I am proud to stand with 
the residents of my home State to rec-
ognize his generosity and selflessness. 
Today, I ask my colleagues to join me 
in honoring a native Nevadan for all 
that he does for the Silver State.∑

REMEMBERING JUDGE ROBERT C. 
BOOCHEVER 
∑ Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, 
next week the Juneau community will 
come together to honor the late Judge 
Robert C. Boochever, who passed away 
on October 9, 2011. At the time of his 
passing, Judge Boochever was a senior 
judge of the Ninth Circuit, U.S. Court 
of Appeals. Since Alaska was admitted 
to statehood, only three Alaskans have 
served on that court. Judge Boochever 
was the first of the three. 
Judge Boochever was not born in 
Alaska, but he earned the right to be 
called an Alaskan through decades of 
service, on and off the bench, to our 
community. Robert C. Boochever was 
born in New York City on October 2, 
1917, and grew up in Ithaca, the home 
of Cornell University where his father 
was director of public relations. He 
completed his undergraduate work and 
law degree at Cornell, then enlisted in 
the Army. Deployed to Newfoundland 
as a legal officer, he met Connie Mad-
dox, who was the chief surgical nurse 
for the base. They were married in 
April 1943. 
At the end of the war, a long-time 
family friend from Cornell, Warren 
Caro, who had been an aide to Alaska’s 
territorial Governor, Ernest Gruening, 
told Judge Boochever about a job in 
Juneau. It was an assistant U.S. attor-
ney position, but at the time there was 
no U.S. attorney, so Boochever would 
in fact be running the operation. At 
the time, Judge Boochever knew noth-
ing of Alaska or Juneau other than the 
praises sung by his family friend, War-
ren Caro. But that didn’t stop him 
from asking Alaska’s delegate to Con-
gress, Bob Bartlett, for a recommenda-
tion. Once offered the job, he persuaded 
Connie to give Alaska a try and they 
never looked back. 
In 1947, Boochever joined the Faulk-
ner Banfield law office in Juneau and 
soon was made a named partner. He 
built 
the 
Faulkner 
Banfield 
firm, 
which dates back to 1914, into one of 
Alaska’s great law firms. That firm 
continues to operate today as Faulkner 
Banfield in Juneau and Holmes, Weddle 
and Barcott with offices in Anchorage, 
Seattle, Portland and San Diego. Mike 
Holmes, one of his partners, described 
Boochever as ‘‘the best trial lawyer in 
the State.’’ He served as president of 
both the Alaska and Juneau Bar Asso-
ciations. 
125TH ANNIVERSARY OF UNITED 
WAY 
∑ Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, today, 
on the 125th Anniversary of United 
Way of America, I wish to pay tribute 
to Nebraska’s many United Way orga-
nizations. United Way is active in the 
communities of Beatrice, Columbus, 
Cozad, Crete, Fremont, Grand Island, 
Hastings, Kearney, Lexington, Lincoln, 
Nebraska City, Norfolk, North Platte, 
Omaha, Scottsbluff, Wayne, York, and 
others. The Nebraskans affiliated with 
these organizations work tirelessly 
every day to improve the lives of those 
around them. 
For the past 125 years, United Way 
has mobilized resources from local 
businesses and individuals to identify 
and meet the needs of the communities 
they serve. Thanks to the leadership 
from local United Way organizations, 
communities in Nebraska have been 
better able to address significant social 
issues. The programs they support help 
those experiencing hunger, domestic 
violence, drug and alcohol abuse, ne-
glect, and many more challenges. In 
Nebraska, the United Way provides 
leadership and helping hands through-
out our State. 
I have had the privilege of working 
with United Way and the agencies they 
TRIBUTE TO RICK CRAIG 
∑ Mr. LEE. Mr. President, today I wish 
to honor Rick Craig, president of 
America First Federal Credit Union. 
Rick was appointed president of the 
credit union in 1997, and previously 
served as the executive vice president 
for two decades. He recently announced 
his retirement and I wish to honor his 
exemplary career. 
Rick is an alumnus of Weber State 
University, where he earned a bachelor 
of science degree in the field of mathe-
matics with a minor in physics. He 
went on to earn a master’s degree in 
the field of engineering from the Uni-
versity of Utah, and graduated in 1981 
from the Western Credit Union Na-
tional Association, CUNA, Manage-
ment School. While in school, Rick 
earned the Charlie Clark Award and 
later was honored with the James D. 
Likens Alumni Recognition Award. He 
has also completed the Credit Union 
Executives Society’s Directors Leader-
ship Institute program at the London 
Business School. Over the years, Rick 
has been willing to share his knowledge 
with others, teaching courses at Weber 
State University and the Western 
CUNA Management School. 
Rick is a past board member of the 
Utah League of Credit Unions, and was 
vice chairman of the league’s Execu-
tive Committee. From 1997 to 2003, he 
also served on the Governor’s Board of 
Credit Union Advisors in Utah. He 
served on the Filene Research Council 
from 1999 to 2005, and he has been a 
member of the CO-OP Board of Direc-
tors since 2005. He has been a director 
of the Credit Union Executives Society, 
CUES, for 9 years, serving as chairman 
of the board. Rick was inducted into 
the Credit Union Society’s Hall of 
Fame in 1996. 
Mr. Craig has received numerous 
honors for his work. Utah Business 
Magazine recognized him as one of the 
one hundred most influential people in 
the State of Utah in 2001, 2004, 2007, and 
2011. He was recognized as one of the 
Ten Trail Blazing Companies in Utah 
in 2003 and in 2004, the national CUES 
named him Executive of the Year. 
Under his leadership, America First 
Credit Union was recognized as one of 
the best places to work in Utah in 2007.

We would like to commend the Aspen 
Center for Physics for their dedication 
and excellence in the field of theo-
retical physics. Since the 1960s the Cen-
ter has been one of the world’s fore-
most research centers for the pursuit 
of basic scientific understanding on 
topics ranging from cosmology to bio-
physics. 
With Federal funding primarily from 
the National Science Foundation and 
the support of dozens of corporate, in-
stitutional, and individual sponsors, 
the Aspen Center for Physics has be-
come an international hub for revolu-
tionary physics research. More than 
10,000 scientists, representing 65 coun-
tries and including 52 Nobel Laureates, 
have participated in Center programs. 
They come to Aspen to converse with 
their peers, conduct groundbreaking 
research, and explore uncharted areas 
in theoretical physics. 
The atmosphere created by the Aspen 
Center for Physics is unique. While sur-
rounded by beautiful landscapes, re-
searchers are encouraged to participate 
in informal dialogue and pursue cre-
ative and novel paths in their research, 
both individually and in collaborative 
groups. 
The unstructured environment has 
been key to the exchange of ideas 
among the world’s best theoretical 
physicists, and it has led to impressive 
results: more than 10,000 scientific pa-
pers and books have cited the Center’s 
influence. 
The Center is also a good neighbor. 
For more than 25 years, the Center has 
offered free public lectures on cutting- 
edge science to the community. It of-
fers informative and interactive pro-
grams designed to engage children in 
learning and get them excited about 
science. Physicists from the Center 
also visit local schools and serve as 
mentors for students. 
Colorado is fortunate to be home to 
the Aspen Center for Physics. Senator 
BENNET and I would like to congratu-
late them for an impressive first 50 
years and wish them continued success 
for the next 50 years.∑

MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT 
Messages from the President of the 
United States were communicated to 
the Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his 
secretaries. 
f 
In 1972, Judge Boochever was named 
to the Alaska Supreme Court and 
served as chief justice for three years. 
In 1980, President Carter nominated 
Judge Boochever to the Ninth Circuit. 
In an oral history, Judge Boochever de-
scribed himself as a champion of indi-
vidual rights who was also sympathetic 
to the problems of law enforcement. 
His Ninth Circuit colleague, Judge 
Dorothy Wright Nelson, the former 
dean of the University of Southern 
California 
Law 
School, 
described 
Boochever as the best writer on the 
court. 
But a distinguished legal career was 
but one measure of this outstanding 
Alaskan. Judge Boochever was a gen-
tleman who greeted women with the 
tip of a hat, a family man whose 
daughter would sing out loud, ‘‘Oh, 
we’re the happy Boochevers’’ to the 
tune of ‘‘Jolly Good Fellow,’’ an avid 
birdwatcher, a poet, a singer and a pi-
anist. 
According to a 1997 tribute in the 
Alaska Bar Rag, he was ‘‘revered by his 
friends and neighbors as a dedicated 
advocate who championed causes that 
helped shape the Juneau community.’’ 
He was the first chairman of the Ju-
neau Planning Commission, a vocal op-
ponent of efforts to move Alaska’s cap-
ital out of Juneau, and a leader in the 
successful campaign to create the Uni-
versity of Alaska Southeast in Auke 
Bay. Judge Boochever, and Connie, who 
predeceased him, were selected by the 
Juneau 
Rotary 
Club 
as 
Man 
and 
Woman of the Year. Connie will long be 
remembered as a champion of the arts 
in Juneau. What an outstanding team. 
Outstanding families are the product 
of 
outstanding 
patriarchs. 
Judge 
Boochever was the father of four out-
standing daughters. Barbara, an avid 
skier, whose daughter Hillary Lindh, 
would grow up to be an Olympic silver 
medalist in downhill skiing; Linda, an 
Anchorage businesswoman; Mimi, a 
teacher nationally renowned for teach-
ing the fine arts to young people; and 
Ann, a music teacher who cofounded 
two of Juneau’s finest restaurants. 
Judge Boochever was outstanding in 
every respect. It is people like Judge 
Boochever who moved Alaska from the 
last frontier of the prestatehood period 
to the best place in America to live, 
work and raise a family. I am grateful 
for his significant contributions to the 
quality of life we today enjoy in the 
State of Alaska. That is why I was 
proud to cosponsor legislation naming 
the Juneau Federal courthouse in per-
petuity for Judge Boochever. That is 
why I am proud to honor his life and 
legacy today.∑

SENATE RESOLUTION 513—RECOG-
NIZING THE 200TH ANNIVERSARY 
OF THE WAR OF 1812, WHICH WAS 
FOUGHT BETWEEN THE UNITED 
STATES 
OF 
AMERICA 
AND 
GREAT BRITAIN BEGINNING ON 
JUNE 18, 1812, IN RESPONSE TO 
BRITISH 
VIOLATIONS 
OF 
NEU-
TRAL RIGHTS OF THE UNITED 
STATES, SEIZURE OF SHIPS OF

TION OF TRADE BETWEEN THE

STATES 
AND 
OTHER 
COUNTRIES, AND THE IMPRESS-
MENT 
OF 
SAILORS 
OF 
THE 
UNITED 
STATES 
INTO 
THE 
ROYAL NAVY 
Mrs. GILLIBRAND submitted the fol-
lowing resolution; which was referred 
to the Committee on the Judiciary: 
S. RES. 513 
Whereas in standing up to the British, and 
fighting the conquerors of Napoleon to a 
draw, the War of 1812 revived flagging na-
tionalism, cleared the way for expanded 
overseas trade, and ended an era of introver-
sion by the United States; 
Whereas most of the public buildings of 
Washington, D.C. were set alight, including 
the White House and the Capitol; 
Whereas Sackets Harbor, New York, on the 
eastern shore of Lake Ontario, was the site 
of more naval construction during the war 
than anywhere else; 
Whereas the war came to the State of New 
York in late December 1813 when the village 
of Black Rock, located 2 miles below Buffalo 
on the front lines of the war, was torched by 
the British and only 1 house was spared; 
Whereas Buffalo, of which it is said that 
‘‘no other town in the United States saw 
more of the war’’, came under regular siege 
from the British and was ultimately burned 
despite assurances that private property 
would be spared; 
Whereas the British capture of Fort Niag-
ara, in a surprise night offensive on Decem-
ber 18, 1813, provided control over the mouth 
of the Niagara River to the British as well as 
the launching pad for its attacks on Buffalo 
and Black Rock; 
Whereas the town of Lewiston, New York, 
which served as the headquarters for the 
United States Army during its attack across 
the river at Queenston, Ontario, was the tar-
get of British retaliation in December 1813, 
resulting in the deaths of many civilians and 
the destruction of all buildings; 
Whereas despite being outnumbered 30 to 1, 
members of the Tuscarora Nation offered the 
first resistance the British and Mohawk al-
lies had seen, saving the lives of dozens of 
Lewiston citizens by allowing them to escape 
the attack; 
Whereas Jacob Brown, a pioneer settler in 
the Black River country of upstate New 
S. 3320 
At the request of Mr. BINGAMAN, the 
names of the Senator from Colorado 
(Mr. BENNET) and the Senator from 
Montana (Mr. TESTER) were added as 
cosponsors of S. 3320, a bill to authorize 
the 
Administrator 
of 
the 
Federal 
Emergency Management Agency to 
waive the 30-day waiting period for 
flood insurance policies purchased for 
private properties affected by wildfire 
on Federal lands. 
STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS 
By Mr. CARDIN (for himself, Mr. 
KIRK, and Ms. MIKULSKI): 
S. 3358. A bill to amend the Older 
Americans Act of 1965 to provide social 
services agencies with the resources to 
provide services to meet the unique 
needs of the Holocaust survivors to age 
in place with dignity, comfort, secu-
rity, and quality of life; to the Com-
mittee on Health, Education, Labor, 
and Pensions. 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise 
today on behalf of myself and Senators 
KIRK and MIKULSKI to introduce the 
Responding to Urgent needs of Sur-
vivors of the Holocaust Act or the 
RUSH Act. 
Our bill will provide needed protec-
tions for survivors of the Holocaust 
who managed to make it to the United 
States after years of prolonged terror, 
abuse, and desperation. Millions fled 
from the cruelty of the Nazi regime be-
tween 1933 and 1945, from territories 
annexed, invaded or occupied by Nazi 
Germany and from their Axis partner 
countries in Europe as well. 
Millions of others were killed during 
the Holocaust, exterminated by a ruth-
less machine propagated by the Nazi 
party. Those who escaped the terror of 
the Nazi regime carried with them ex-
periences that can never be forgotten, 
and have adversely affected their abil-
ity to cope with institutionalized set-
tings. 
Many Holocaust survivors living in 
the United States would prefer to 
spend their days at home with their 
families, rather than being moved into 
settings where they lose autonomy, 
privacy, and control, which can bring 
back painful trauma from their experi-
ences under Nazi rule. This bill would 
amend the Older Americans Act to en-
sure that Holocaust survivors can bet-
ter access needed services, such as 
health care and nutrition services, 
without having to live in a nursing or 
assisted living facility. 
As of 2010, there were approximately 
127,000 Holocaust survivors living in 
the United States, and more than three 
quarters of them are over age 75, with 
a majority in their 80s and 90s. By fo-
cusing on home and community-based 
long-term care, we can help ensure 
that fewer survivors are dependent on

Sisters of the United States, whose inspiring 
legacy of service enriches the Nation;

National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, to re-
store the financial solvency of the flood in-

was ordered to lie on the table. 
Whereas Loyola became just the ninth 
team to win an NCAA Division I Men’s La-
crosse National Championship since the first 
championship was held in 1971; 
Whereas the Loyola Greyhounds secured 
their victory in only their second appearance 
in a national championship, having been de-
feated by Syracuse in 1990; 
Whereas the vision and leadership of the 
Rev. Brian Linnane, S.J. and Jim Paquette, 
Loyola University’s President and Athletic 
Director, respectively, were instrumental in 
bringing academic and athletic success, as 
well as national recognition, to Loyola Uni-

Whereas the 2012 Loyola University Mary-

Whereas the victory at Plattsburgh shat-
tered any hopes of British gains in the 
North, helped maintain national morale

summer of 1814, and was described by Win-
ston Churchill as the ‘‘most decisive engage-
ment of the war’’; 
Whereas from the death and destruction of 
the War of 1812 there was born a spirit of co-

tween the United States and Canada since 
the War of 1812 find the deepest roots and 
daily expressions in the border communities

front line of the War of 1812; 
Whereas the bicentennial of the War of 1812 
offers an exceptional opportunity to ac-
knowledge and celebrate the true and lasting 
legacy of 200 years of peace between the 
United States and Canada; and 
Whereas through the turmoil of war, a 
young nation endured and saw its banner 
continue to wave over a land free and brave: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate recognizes the 
200th anniversary of the War of 1812.

COMMEMORATING 
THE 
VICTORY 
OF LOYOLA UNIVERSITY MARY-
LAND 
Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent 
the Senate proceed to S. Res. 514. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the resolution by 
title. 
The legislative clerk read as follows. 
A resolution, (S. Res. 514) commemorating 
the victory of Loyola University Maryland 
in the 2012 NCAA Division I Men’s Lacrosse 
National Championship. 
Coach Charley Toomey, Athletic Direc-
tor Jim Paquette, and President, the 
Rev. Brian Linnane, S.J. on a cham-
pionship season and the many amazing 
achievements that carried the Grey-
hounds to victory. 
Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unan-
imous consent the resolution be agreed 
to, the preamble be agreed to, the mo-
tions to reconsider be laid upon the 
table, with no intervening action or de-
bate, and any statements be printed in 
the RECORD. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The resolution (S. Res. 514) was 
agreed to. 
The preamble was agreed to. 
The resolution, with its preamble, 
reads as follows: 
S. RES. 514 
Whereas on May 28, 2012, Loyola University 
Maryland won its first NCAA Division I 
Men’s Lacrosse National Championship and 
the first Division I national title in the his-
tory of the school; 
Whereas Loyola is the smallest school in 
NCAA history to win the Division I Men’s 
Lacrosse National Championship, with only 
3,863 undergraduate students; 
Whereas the Loyola Greyhounds finished 
the men’s lacrosse season with a record of 18 
wins and 1 loss; 
Whereas the Loyola Greyhounds set a 
NCAA record for the fewest goals allowed 
during a men’s lacrosse championship game; 
Whereas 5 members of the Loyola Grey-
hounds, Joe Fletcher, Josh Hawkins, Eric 
Lusby, Scott Ratliff, and Jack Runkel, were 
named members of the All-Tournament 
team; 
Whereas Loyola senior Eric Lusby was 
named the Most Outstanding Player of the 
2012 NCAA Division I Men’s Lacrosse Na-
tional Championship after scoring 4 goals in 
the title game, while also setting a tour-
nament record with a total of 17 goals in 4 
games; 
Whereas sophomore goalie Jack Runkel 
had 6 saves in the championship game, hold-
ing the University of Maryland to only 3 
goals; 
Whereas the 18 wins by the Loyola Grey-
hounds this season set a program record; 
Whereas Loyola became just the ninth 
team to win an NCAA Division I Men’s La-
crosse National Championship since the first 
championship was held in 1971; 
Whereas the Loyola Greyhounds secured 
their victory in only their second appearance 
in a national championship, having been de-
feated by Syracuse in 1990; 
Whereas the vision and leadership of the 
Rev. Brian Linnane, S.J. and Jim Paquette, 
Loyola University’s President and Athletic 
Director, respectively, were instrumental in 
bringing academic and athletic success, as 
well as national recognition, to Loyola Uni-
versity Maryland; and 
Whereas the 2012 Loyola University Mary-
land men’s lacrosse team has brought great 
honor and pride to their university, the 
State of Maryland, and the United States: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) congratulates the Loyola University 
Maryland Greyhounds for winning the 2012 
NCAA Division I Men’s Lacrosse National 
Championship; 
(2) recognizes the achievements of the 
players, coaches, students, and staff whose 
hard work and dedication were key to 
Loyola’s victory in the championship game; 
and 
(3) requests the Secretary of the Senate to 
transmit for appropriate display an enrolled 
There being no objection, the Senate 
proceeded to consider the resolution. 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to recognize and commemorate 
Loyola University of Maryland’s vic-
tory in the 2012 NCAA Men’s Lacrosse 
Championship and to honor the play-
ers, coaches, and administrators who 
helped to secure Loyola’s first Division 
I National Championship. 
For much of recent history, NCAA 
Division I Lacrosse has been dominated 
by a small group of eight, elite pro-
grams. But last month, a Jesuit uni-
versity on Charles Street in downtown 
Baltimore became the smallest school 
ever to win a Division I National 
Championship. Loyola joins the ranks 
of such universities as Johns Hopkins 
University, the University of Mary-
land, Syracuse, and Cornell, in becom-
ing just the ninth team to win a cham-
pionship since the event’s creation in 
1971. 
This 
year’s 
Division 
I 
National 
Championship set the stage for an 
afternoon of record-shattering lacrosse. 
The Greyhound defense and goalkeeper 
Jack Runkel set a new NCAA Division 
I record for fewest goals allowed in a 
national championship game, giving up 
only three goals despite a barrage of 
nearly thirty shots taken by the highly 
motivated University of Maryland of-
fense. 
Loyola University’s star offensive 
player, Eric Lusby, had a busy day as 
well. He scored four goals in the cham-
pionship game, bringing his total to 17 
during the final four games of the sea-
son, setting a new NCAA tournament 
record. He also broke Loyola’s single 
season scoring record with a total of 54 
goals. 
Loyola University players were not 
the only ones to break records last 
month. Head Coach Charley Toomey 
became the first coach ever to win an 
NCAA title on his first trip to the 
NCAA tournament. With 18 wins and 
only one loss, the players and coaches 
of the 2012 Greyhounds lacrosse team 
have firmly cemented themselves as 
the most successful team in Loyola’s 
history. The team’s achievements are 
even more impressive when you con-
sider that the Greyhounds started the 
season as an unranked team. 
Lacrosse has long played a central 
role in the athletic culture of Mary-
land, and I am proud to see that this 
year’s All-Tournament Team selec-
tions reflect this reality. Eight of the 
ten players selected to receive All- 
Tournament 
honors 
call 
Maryland 
home, with five coming from the Loy-
ola Greyhounds team and three from 
the 
University 
of 
Maryland. 
With 
Loyola’s victory in this year’s cham-
pionship, Maryland is now home to 
three of the nine teams that have ever 
won a national championship, further 
securing our State’s reputation as the 
center of collegiate lacrosse. 
In light of these impressive accom-
plishments, I call upon my colleagues 
to join me in recognizing and congratu-
lating 
Loyola 
University’s 
players,

STAKE-
HOLDER PARTICIPATION ACT OF 
2011 
HON. C.A. DUTCH RUPPERSBERGER 
HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR. 
OF MARYLAND 
SPEECH OF 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
HON. LAURA RICHARDSON 
Thursday, June 28, 2012 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 26, 2012 
Mr. RUPPERSBERGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
before you today to honor Mr. Leonard Attman 
and Mrs. Phyllis Attman for their lifelong com-
mitment to making a difference in the lives of 
those less fortunate. We recognize their gen-
erosity as the Board Room of Sinai Hospital in 
Baltimore is named in their honor. 
Ms. RICHARDSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of H.R. 1447, the Aviation 
Security Stakeholder Participation Act of 2011, 
which amongst other things amends title 49 of 
the United States Code to direct the Assistant 
Secretary of Homeland Security (Transpor-
tation Security Administration) to establish an 
Aviation Security Advisory Committee (ASAC). 
In Baltimore, the Attman name is synony-
mous with ‘‘charity.’’ Over the years, Mr. and 
Mrs. Attman have worked hard to make a dif-
ference in the community through countless 
philanthropic efforts. In the past, they have 
made generous donations to support medical 
research, including groundbreaking studies on 
breast cancer and brain tumors. Their efforts 
have brought much-needed support to fields 
that are often overlooked or are in greater 
need of further understanding. 
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) 
established the ASAC in 1989 following the 
bombing of Pan American World Airways 
Flight 103. When the Transportation Security 
Administration (TSA) was established, the 
sponsorship of the ASAC transferred to TSA. 
Despite significant contributions to TSA policy-
making, particularly with respect to air cargo 
security, and strong support from aviation se-
curity stakeholders who participated in the 
ASAC, TSA allowed the ASAC’s charter to ex-
pire. 
In addition to serving as a board member at 
Sinai and Northwest Hospitals, Mr. Attman’s 
involvement in professional, civic and philan-
thropic organizations includes membership on 
the boards of Shosana S. Cardin High School 
and Beth Tfiloh Brotherhood, as well as the 
Board ofDirectors of the Reginald F. Lewis 
Museum and the Signal 13 Foundation for the 
Baltimore City Police Department. He actively 
participates in the activities of many other or-
ganizations including the Advisory Board for 
the Shock Trauma Unit at the University of 
Maryland Medical Systems. 
H.R. 1447 provides for the establishment of 
an ASAC to assist and make recommenda-
tions to the TSA Assistant Secretary on avia-
tion security matters, including the develop-
ment and implementation of policies, pro-
grams, rulemaking, and security directives per-
taining to aviation security. Within the Advisory 
Committee are three subcommittees: (1) an air 
cargo security working group, (2) a general 
aviation working group, and (3) an airport pe-
rimeter security working group. 
A longtime business leader, Mr. Attman has 
more than four decades of experience in resi-
dential and commercial real estate develop-
ment. Mr. Attman was also the founder and 
serves as Chairman of the Board of Directors 
of Future Care, which manages nine nursing 
home facilities serving more than 1,300 pa-
tients and providing employment to more than 
1,500 workers. 
U.S. and industry stakeholders have ex-
pressed frustration about the level of dialogue 
with TSA about the threat of potential attacks. 
The lack of communication between TSA and 
stakeholders makes our aviation industry vul-
nerable to threats such as Yemen insurgents 
shipping explosive devices on our passenger 
and cargo airplanes. H.R. 1447 provides us 
with the tools to reopen these lines of commu-
nication between air carriers to aircraft manu-
facturers from aviation technology security in-
dustries to labor organizations. 
In all of their business endeavors, the 
Attmans have always focused on family first. 
Mr. Attman humbly considers his employees 
not as subordinates, but as ‘‘coworkers.’’ He 
has worked to do whatever possible to avoid 
layoffs during the unsteady economic times in 
recent years. 
Mr. Speaker, as a member of the Com-
mittee on Homeland Security, I fought for and 
strongly supported legislation that protects our 
homeland and our people. I will continue to 
support legislation that enables us to stay 
ahead of any potential threat. That is why I 
support H.R. 1447, the Aviation Security 
Stakeholder Participation Act of 2011, and 
urge my colleagues to do likewise. 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 28, 2012 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to pay tribute to Mr. Dan Bollinger, Sr. 
as he retires after over thirty years of illus-
trious service as an executive of regional de-
velopment organizations in Georgia. A cele-
bration will be held in his honor on Thursday, 
June 28, 2012 at the Camilla Depot in 
Camilla, Georgia at 5:30 p.m. 
Mr. Bollinger, a native of Missouri, was 
raised in a small town of 600 people. He grad-
uated from the University of Missouri—Colum-
bia with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Political 
Science. He also pursued a higher level of 
education in the field of Community and Eco-
nomic Development. 
A strong leader with an exceptional work 
ethic, Mr. Bollinger is currently the Executive 
Director of Southwest Georgia Regional Com-
mission, a planning agency that serves 14 
Georgia counties including Baker, Calhoun, 
Colquitt, Decatur, Dougherty, Early, Grady, 
Lee, Miller, Mitchell, Seminole, Terrell, Thom-
as, and Worth. The SWGRC is responsible for 
assisting local governments with comprehen-
sive planning in land and economic develop-
ment. Mr. Bollinger has held the position of 
Executive Director since 1994. 
I. the past, Mr. Bollinger has also served as 
president of the National Association of Devel-
opment Organizations and of the Georgia As-
sociation of Regional Development Centers as 
well as serving as Executive Director of the 
Missouri Bootheel Regional Planning and Eco-
nomic Development Commission for 11 years. 
Additionally, he was vice president of the Bank 
of Chaffee in Missouri. 
Mr. Bollinger also served our country for 
four years in the United States Air Force. He 
volunteered as president of the Chaffee, Mis-
souri Chamber of Commerce for two terms. 
Additionally, he umpired baseball and fast 
pitch softball and refereed basketball for 25 
years on the amateur level. Since moving to 
Georgia, he has become an avid tennis player 
and golfer. 
George Washington Carver once said, ‘‘How 
far you go in life depends on your being ten-
der with the young, compassionate with the 
aged, sympathetic with the striving and toler-
ant of the weak and strong because someday 
in your life you will have been all of these.’’ As 
a leader, Mr. Bollinger recognized the impor-
tance of serving others. 
It cannot be disputed that Dan Bollinger, Sr. 
has achieved numerous successes in his life. 
However, none of this would have been pos-
sible without the enduring love and support of 
his loving wife, Lynn, and wonderful children 
and grandchildren. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me 
in paying tribute to Mr. Bollinger for his out-
standing professional achievements and his 
dedicated service to Southwest Georgia. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask that you join with me 
today to honor Mr. Leonard and Mrs. Phyllis 
Attman. Their compassion and dedication to 
the Baltimore community and Sinai Hospital is 
an inspiration to us all. It is with great pride 
that I congratulate them on their exemplary 
service to their community and our country 
and wish them many more years of success.

INDEPENDENCE DAY IN HONOR OF 
OUR ARMED FORCES AND THEIR 
FAMILIES 
HON. JEAN SCHMIDT 
OF OHIO 
OF LOUISIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 28, 2012 
Mr. BOUSTANY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to commemorate the article on the front page 
of the Wall Street Journal this morning recog-
nizing the fantastic food and culture in my 
South Louisiana. 
I invite any of my colleagues to travel with 
me to Louisiana to enjoy the fantastic boudin 
and Cajun culture that comprises our proud 
heritage in South Louisiana. All along South 
Louisiana we enjoy the best homemade Cajun 
boudin, zydeco music, and Cajun charm that 
is truly unique to the United States. Today, the 
Wall Street Journal recognized this vibrancy in 
its article titled ‘‘Cajun Towns Feud About 
Sausage With Links to the Past.’’ To com-
memorate this fact, I include the article, written 
by Timothy W. Martin, into the CONGRESSIONAL 
RECORD in its entirety here: 
SCOTT, LA.—Few would dispute that south-
ern Louisiana is boudin heaven. The local 
version is a sausage made of pork, rice and 
various seasonings. Trickier to answer is 
which of three competing Cajun commu-
nities is its official mecca. 
In April, Louisiana’s state legislature be-
stowed the coveted mantle of Boudin Capital 
of the World on Scott, a bustling town of 
8,600 on Interstate 10—the busy east-west 
highway linking Houston and New Orleans. 
It churns out 1.3 million pounds of the sau-
sage a year. 
‘‘No one comes close’’ to Scott’s sausage 
output, boasts Mayor Purvis J. Morrison, 
who lobbied hard for the title, plying law-
makers with industry statistics to make his 
case. 
UPS trucks collect boudin (pronounced: 
Boo-DAN, while swallowing the N) shipments 
here twice a day, he says. Sales help stuff 
city coffers. 
‘‘If you like hot, you’ll get hot. If you want 
mild, you’ll find mild. We have boudin balls 
as big as a softball. We have smoked boudin. 
I don’t even know if anybody did it before we 
did it,’’ he says. 
But Scott’s new title—which it uses for 
marketing purposes—has left a bad taste in 
the mouths of residents of Broussard, 12 
miles to the southeast. They insist their 
town, population 7,600, is the Boudin Capital 
of the World—a title they say lawmakers 
gave them in the late 1970s. True, Broussard 
doesn’t hold its annual boudin festival or 
crown a Boudin king anymore. But towns-
people don’t see that as a reason for the leg-
islature to snub them. 
‘‘For some reason, Scott wants to be the 
Boudin capital, and they’re trying to take 
our title. Doesn’t hardly seem right,’’ says 
Billy Billeaud, owner of a grocery store in 
Broussard. 
Billy Billeaud’s grocery store in Broussard,

Mrs. SCHMIDT. Mr. Speaker, in honor and 
in remembrance of all of our Armed Forces 
and their families on this Independence Day, 
who are fighting and have fallen, and are re-
covering from the scars of war. I ask that this 
poem penned by Albert Caswell be placed in 
the RECORD.

Remembering our Forefathers Declaration of 
Independence, they! 
Remember to so kneel and pray! 
For all of those,

As we so awake . . . 
All in the happiness and that glory of this

That which freedom does so all of us so 
bathe! 
All on this holiday! 
Our Nation’s Birthday! 
As that old Red, White and Blue so waves! 
All in our Independence that they so give,

For all of those magnificents, 
who now so lie in such cold dark quiet 
graves! 
Whose families great pain shall not ever so 
wave! 
‘‘Oh say can you see’’ on this day! 
‘‘By the dawn’s early light’’, 
all of those soft cold quiet graves! 
As you so wipe your tears away! 
This Independence Day! 
Remember all of those and they, 
who are without their families, gone! 
And all of those who come home from war, 
without arms and legs who must now so cou-
rageously live on! 
To teach us where courage is born! 
And all of those with the unseen scars of 
war, 
that which now so form! 
All over there, 
where the battle now so rages on! 
‘‘With the bombs bursting in air’’. . . 
‘‘And the rockets red glare!’’ 
Which gives proof through the night, 
of that courage they wear! 
Who all for us so fight, 
and so die over there! 
As this Independence Day, 
as you hold your families oh so very close! 
And all of those picnics and family gath-
erings you so host! 
And so watch those fire works, explode! 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 28, 2012 
Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
pay tribute ute to the life of Dr. Wendy Wayne 
who passed away on June 17, 2012 at the 
age of 64 after fighting a courageous four year 
battle with non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma. Wendy 
was a loving wife and mother, a committed ac-
tivist and respected community leader who 
touched the lives of many. 
A proud product of Culver City, California, 
Wendy was born on February 4, 1948. She at-
tended Hamilton High School in Los Angeles 
and graduated from the University of Los An-
geles (UCLA) before joining the Peace Corps 
and serving in Kenya. She married the love of 
her life, Gene Tackett, after traveling around 
the world and then working on Gene’s first po-
litical campaign for Kern County Supervisor. 
Wendy quickly became an icon and a source 
of inspiration within the local community. 
Wendy and Gene started their family in Ba-
kersfield in 1978 and have worked continu-
ously to improve the quality of life of all fami-
lies in Kern County, the place they called 
home. 
Through her leadership and hard work, 
Wendy became a role model for her friends 
and neighbors. Dr. Wendy Wayne exemplified 
the true meaning of being an advocate. After 
working at Clinica Sierra Vista and obtaining a 
nursing degree at California State University 
(CSUB), she worked as a nurse at Kern Med-
ical Center (KMC). She continued her volun-
teer activities promoting child safety seats and 
expanded childcare opportunities for working 
mothers. Both of her sons were born in the 
KMC Birthing Center organized by Wendy. In 
1986, Wendy started her career with the Kern 
County Superintendent of School’s office as 
an advocate for expanded preschool edu-
cation. Working with community leaders she 
helped create the Community Connection for 
Childcare and became its first director. She 
later became the executive director of Kern 
County’s First Five organization, an agency 
promoting child education during their first five 
years of age. For more than 36 years, she 
was a committed and reliable member of the 
community. 
Over the years, Wendy continued to fulfill 
her wanderlust for travel and doing good 
works with a three month health project in 
Kenya, Bakersfield Sister City trips, Rotary 
polio ratification trips to India and Nigeria, 
working with her niece Ann Reiner in the 
Sudan and Uganda. Her family vacations in-
cluded a revisit to her Kenyan village where 
she had once taught biology. Remarkably, 
Wendy endured countless hours of travel to 
receive advanced cancer treatment in South-
ern California while simultaneously serving as 
a consultant to San Joaquin Hospital to de-
velop a much needed state of the art cancer 
center in Bakersfield. Her work demonstrated 
her dedication to fostering and preserving the 
health and safety of children throughout the 
world, and her compassion and concern for 
our community served as a testament to her 
extraordinary character. 
Wendy lived an exemplary life and will un-
doubtedly be missed by many. The true loves

friend, and the number that he has gained is 
almost too large to measure. 
But central to Frank McCrea is being a 
magnificent father. In his local community the-
ater, Frank has been cast as a dad over 15 
times—for good reason. His daughters Karen, 
Christine and Beth have all gone on to raise 
children of their own and lead significant lives, 
but they all point to the bedrock of love from 
their father and mother that launched them. I 
truly believe that all of us would regard as our 
greatest accomplishment if our children were 
to feel about us as his daughters feel about 
him. 
In sum, Mr. Speaker, let me say that we are 
indeed fortunate to have citizens like Frank 
McCrea and that I join his church, his commu-
nity, his friends and his family in wishing him 
the happiest of birthdays.

CONGRATULATIONS TO PEDDLER’S 
VILLAGE ON ITS 50TH ANNIVER-
SARY 
HON. MICHAEL G. FITZPATRICK 
Winning the title of Boudin Capital of the 
World was one of Mr. Morrison’s first legisla-
tive goals when he became mayor in January 
2011. Boudin makers employ 83 people in the 
town and account for $5 million in annual 
sales, helping anchor the local economy’s 
growth over the past decade. ‘‘Without 
boudin, we’d just be a regular I–10 exit, with 
a McDonald’s, a Burger King and a Chev-
ron,’’ says Mr. Morrison, sitting in his office 
next to a two-year-old fire and police station 
that tax revenue from boudin sales helped 
fund. 
Rob Pelissier pulled off Scott’s I–10 exit 
one recent morning and headed to Don’s Spe-
cialty Meats. The store has billboards pro-
moting its ‘‘best homemade boudin’’ some 40 
miles to the west—just a few miles outside 
Jennings. ‘‘Maybe Jennings or Broussard had 
the title years back. I’d say yeah, they were 
good back then. But nowadays, this place 
here has got it,’’ he said, staring at his 
empty plate. ‘‘If you spend a day here, you 
can see all of the traffic coming here from 
out of town.’’ 
Mr. 
Ortego’s 
legislation 
doesn’t 
ask 
Broussard to cede its title. For their part, 
Broussard town leaders have accepted their 
new role in the boudin world and have down-
graded their expectations. The town’s mayor 
has considered seeking the title ‘‘Boudin 
Capital of Louisiana’’ next year.

HIS 90TH BIRTHDAY 
HON. JACKIE SPEIER 
OF PENNSYLVANIA

Thursday, June 28, 2012 
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to recognize Peddler’s Village in Bucks Coun-
ty, Pennsylvania, as it celebrates its 50th An-
niversary this month. 
A community staple in my home of Bucks 
County, millions of guests from across the 
Delaware and Lehigh Valleys have visited this 
center of commerce and culture over the last 
five decades. 
Founded in 1962 with the opening of a 
handful of small shops and a flagship res-
taurant, Peddler’s Village now attracts 1.6 mil-
lion annual visitors to its 70 independently- 
owned specialty shops, six restaurants and 
year-round festivals across its 42 acres of 
landscaped gardens and colonial-era architec-
ture. 
The success of this collection of Bucks 
County small-business men and women in ful-
filling the vision of its founder, Earl Jamison, 
serves as an example to each of us of the 
creativity and perseverance of the American 
spirit. 
Congratulations to Peddler’s Village on 
marking 50 years of tradition, and I wish them 
the best of luck in the decades to come.

HONORING THE FALLEN POLICE 
OFFICERS OF HENRICO COUNTY, 
VA 
HON. ERIC CANTOR 
Mr. Billeaud calls Scott a boudin arriviste 
whose meaty reputation is the product of ag-
gressive marketing by numerous restaurants 
and meat specialty shops that have popped 
up in recent years on the edge of town to 
stuff boudin-loving travelers on busy Inter-
state 10. 
‘‘We don’t have I–10 in Broussard,’’ says 
Mr. Billeaud, 51 years old, the fourth genera-
tion Billeaud to own the store since it 
opened in 1889. 
‘‘Broussard can’t claim nothing. They had 
the title and haven’t done anything for 15 
years,’’ fires back Aubrey Cole, owner of 
Don’s Specialty Meats just off I–10 in Scott. 
Meanwhile, in Jennings, 35 miles or so west 
on I–10, Mayor Terry W. Duhon can’t under-
stand what the hot-dogging is all about. Jen-
nings is Boudin Capital of the Universe, 
thanks to famed boudin chef and Jennings 
resident Ellis Cormier, who roamed the state 
decades ago promoting boudin and won the 
title for his hometown in the 1970s. 
‘‘We’ve got squatter’s rights,’’ says Mr. 
Duhon, who has the phone number of his fa-
vorite go-to joint—Mr. Cormier’s Boudin 
King—on speed dial. No signs or billboards in 
the town mention Jennings’s intergalactic 
ranking, because, ‘‘What do we need to pro-
mote it for? We know,’’ he says. 
Such lofty titles are of no small impor-
tance. Sales of boudin are on the rise, ac-
cording to restaurateurs, online grocers and 
locals. The sausage has been featured on the 
menu at Cochon, a contemporary Cajun res-
taurant in New Orleans’s trendy Warehouse 
District, which started serving a fried 
version of the sausage with pickled peppers 
last year. 
‘‘Until we got the title, we never heard 
anything from Broussard or Jennings. Now 
they are coming out of the woodwork,’’ com-
plains Donna Thibodeaux, who works at a 
tourism center in Scott next to one of the 
town’s five boudin sellers. 
Boudin’s precise origins are not a matter 
of noir and blanc, though the sausages have 
been made in southern Louisiana since the 
mid-1800s. Back then, French Acadians—an-
cestors of the Cajuns—took leftover parts of 
a slaughtered pig and mixed them with rice, 
vegetables and seasonings and encased them 
in intestines. Some modern takes on boudin 
substitute pork with crawfish or shrimp. Mr. 
Cormier’s version used more rice than meat, 
helping popularize the sausage to non-Cajuns 
because it masked the taste of bolder ingre-
dients like pork butt and liver. 
Boudin connoisseurs aren’t taking sides. 
Mr. Billeaud’s boudin in Broussard earned an 
‘‘A+’’ 
on 
‘‘The 
BoudinLink,’’ 
a 
review 
website operated by Bob Carriker, a history 
professor at the University of Louisiana at 
Lafayette, the city that both Scott and 
Broussard border. But he also praises Scott 
for its juicy version and Jennings for letting 
rice take on ‘‘the starring role.’’ 
Lawmakers, 
for 
their 
part, 
are 
unapologetic about the grilling they are get-
ting now from boudin makers about the mul-
tiple titles. ‘‘This is not about the past, it’s 
about the future,’’ state Rep. Stephen Ortego 
said on the floor of the legislature, explain-
ing his reasons for sponsoring the bill favor-
ing Scott. He says his staff couldn’t find any 
legislation anointing Broussard as boudin 
capital, and the state representative who al-
legedly backed that bill is deceased. 
As for Jennings, he says, the titles of 
‘‘world’’ and ‘‘universe’’ can coexist because 
Jennings doesn’t promote its status. ‘‘Any-
body can claim a title. But are you using 
it?’’ he reasons. 
On a recent morning, Mr. Ortego, who grew 
up near Scott, laid a paper napkin across his 
left leg and tucked into a link of Mr. 
Billeaud’s boudin. ‘‘This one has too much 
pepper,’’ he said, arguing that Scott’s is su-
perior.

Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
pay tribute to a great American, Frank 
McCrea, on the celebration of his 90th birth-
day. 
Frank McCrea is a member of what we 
have rightfully come to call The Greatest Gen-
eration. He is everything we have come to cel-
ebrate about that celebrated group: a devoted 
son, brother and father; an unquestioning pa-
triot; an extraordinary servant to his faith; and 
a true citizen of his community. 
Frank McCrea and his 5 brothers and sis-
ters were raised in the depths of the Great 
Depression. Often, they had nothing more for 
dinner than the vegetables they grew in their 
own garden. Yet Frank will reflect on those 
years not about hardship and deprivation, but 
about how the love of a close family lit them 
from within. 
When the War came, Frank did not hesitate: 
he volunteered for the Navy, and served his 
country with honor. As one who personally 
has had her life saved by those who choose 
to serve our nation, I speak with special em-
phasis in expressing our country’s eternal debt 
to those who serve in our armed forces. 
Faith has been at the core of Frank’s life. 
He has long been a deacon of his church and 
has been an active member of the Gideon So-
ciety for over 40 years. All of us who have 
come into Frank’s remarkable orbit have felt 
the bond Frank has with his faith, and have 
come to know the special peace that faith has 
given to him. 
Another cornerstone for Frank has been 
friendship. I know that this weekend he will be 
surrounded by a legion of true friends, a num-
ber who have been connected to Frank since 
high school—over 70 years ago. I think Frank 
can honestly boast that he has never lost a

Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, re-
cently, as many of my colleagues have re-
marked on the House floor, we reached the 
sad milestone of two thousand American sol-
diers having lost their lives in Afghanistan. 
Tomorrow we break for our July 4th recess, 
celebrating our nation’s independence, but for 
too many American families missing a father, 
a son or a daughter, the fourth of July will be 
a day of absence. 
Mr. Speaker, we have a word for people 
who lose a spouse: ‘‘Widower.’’ 
We have a word also for the children left 
behind when parents die: ‘‘Orphans.’’ But we 
have no words for the parents of children who 
die. 
It is a tragedy when a parent outlives their 
child, and it is time to put an end to our chil-
dren dying in Afghanistan. 
For the families of two thousand American 
soldiers, and equally important, for the Afghan 
families who have lost sons and daughters, 
we need to end this war and bring our soldiers 
home so that a political solution can be 
achieved.

IN HONOR OF YO AZAMA 
HON. SAM FARR 
Gail is an example of national heroes who 
remain too often unsung—those who answer a 
call to serve directly those most in need, re-
gardless of their location around the world. 
Working in the field of global health and devel-
opment with Family Health International (FHI 
360), she contributed to the lives of vulnerable 
women and children during extended postings 
in the Caribbean, where she began her ca-
reer, and in East Africa, where she confronted 
the misery of the HIV/AIDS epidemic by 
founding and directing a truly innovative pro-
gram (known as the ROADS Project) to pre-
vent the spread of HIV/AIDS along African 
transport corridors.

Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I rise to con-
gratulate Mr. Peter DeCraene, a math teacher 
at Evanston Township High School, for receiv-
ing the 2011 Presidential Award for Excellence 
in 
Mathematics 
and 
Science 
Teaching 
(PAEMST). 
The PAEMST program recognizes out-
standing teachers for their contribution to 
teaching mathematics or science. Sponsored 
by the White House and administered by the 
National Science Foundation, PAEMST award 
recipients receive a certificate from President 
Obama and $10,000. The award only goes to 
the finest teachers of science and mathe-
matics in the country. 
This year, President Obama recognized 97 
mathematics and science teachers as recipi-
ents of this esteemed award. The applicants 
were chosen for their abilities to convey the 
concepts of math and science to their stu-
dents, along with their work experience, edu-
cational background, and extracurricular activi-
ties related to the classroom. The PAEMST 
program rewards teachers for preparing and 
establishing a solid foundation of science, 
technology, engineering, and math in Amer-
ica’s youth. Peter DeCraene has succeeded 
throughout his career, creatively teaching 
these disciplines to his students while helping 
his colleagues to do the same. 
Mr. DeCraene’s passion and enthusiasm 
over the past 23 years have inspired hundreds 
of students so that they may better contribute 
to America’s success. The Chicago native 
graduated from DePaul University with a B.A. 
in mathematics, and an M.S. in computer 
science, and he received a Certificate of Ad-
vanced Study in educational leadership from 
National Lewis University. He prefers teaching 
in small groups so that students may learn by 
answering one another’s questions. He is cur-
rently the math department chair at Evanston 
Township High School, overseeing 30 teach-
ers, along with instructing new teachers in the 
school wide induction program. The DePaul 
University graduate is also a textbook author 
who has presented at state and local con-
ferences. 
Please join me in honoring my constituent, 
Peter DeCraene, and all the recipients of the 
2011 Presidential Award for Excellence in 
Mathematics and Science Teaching. This is an 
honor worthy of special distinction and I look 
forward to seeing more great things from Mr. 
DeCraene.

time to congratulate the individuals who will 
take their oath of citizenship on July 4, 2012. 
In true patriotic fashion, on the day of our 
great nation’s celebration of independence, a 
naturalization ceremony will take place, wel-
coming new citizens of the United States of 
America. This memorable occasion, coordi-
nated by the Hammond Public Library and 
presided over by Magistrate Judge Andrew 
Rodovich, will be held at The Pavilion at Wolf 
Lake in Hammond, Indiana. 
America is a country founded by immi-
grants. From its beginning, settlers have come 
from countries around the globe to the United 
States in search of better lives for their fami-
lies. The upcoming oath ceremony will be a 
shining example of what is so great about the 
United States of America—that people from all 
over the world can come together and unite as 
members of a free, democratic nation. These 
individuals realize that nowhere else in the 
world offers a better opportunity for success 
than here in America. 
er Identification Credential, TWIC, to require, 
in total, not more than one in-person visit to a 
designated enrollment center. 
The TWIC program was established to en-
sure all individuals who require admittance 
into secure areas of regulated maritime facili-
ties and vessels are properly vetted and do 
not pose a threat to maritime and supply chain 
security. Current TWIC requirements require 
that applicants go to an enrollment center 
twice to complete the application and confirm 
the biometric information embedded into the 
card. 
Mr. Speaker, I believe that this is an oner-
ous burden for workers in the maritime indus-
try, such as merchant vessel operators and 
truck drivers, who must obtain the credential 
for employment. Individuals in need of a TWIC 
card often work long hours with little down 
time. Many cannot afford to take extended pe-
riods of time off to go to an enrollment center, 
in some cases located hundreds of miles 
away, on two different occasions. 
I believe that the Secretary of Homeland 
Security should reform the TWIC process be-
fore the end of 2012, when the TWICs first 
issued in 2007 will need to be renewed allow-
ing applicants to complete the process with 
only one in-person visit. I urge Members of 
Congress to support H.R. 3173, to direct the 
Secretary of Homeland Security to reform the 
process 
for 
the 
enrollment, 
activation, 
issuance, and renewal of the TWIC program.

lic safety, maintaining the ward’s housing 
stock and developing additional recreational 
opportunities for families. Brady serves as the 
Chair of the Public Service Committee, Vice- 
Chair of Public Safety, and as a member of 
the Council’s Finance and Community and 
Economic Development Committees. 
Councilwoman Brady is also involved in

IN LAS VEGAS, NEVADA 
Though each individual has sought to be-
come a citizen of the United States for his or 
her own reasons, be it for education, occupa-
tion, or to offer their loved ones better lives, 
each is inspired by the fact that the United 
States of America is, as Abraham Lincoln de-
scribed it, a country ‘‘. . .of the people, by the 
people, and for the people.’’ They realize that 
the United States is truly a free nation. By 
seeking American citizenship, they have made 
the decision to live in a place where, as guar-
anteed by the First Amendment of the Bill of 
Rights, they can practice religion as they 
choose, speak their minds without fear of pun-
ishment, and assemble in peaceful protest 
should they choose to do so.

INTRODUCTION OF THE TAXPAYER 
BILL OF RIGHTS ACT OF 2012 
HON. XAVIER BECERRA 
The National Council of La Raza became a 
national organization in 1972. NCLR has 
grown and evolved over the course of its his-
tory to become the most authoritative voice on 
Hispanic issues today. Latinos are strength-
ened through participation in NCLR and in the 
political process through its various civic en-
gagement projects. NCLR also works to 
strengthen emerging community-based organi-
zations in areas where there is a growing 
Latino population. 
Now in its 44th year, NCLR is busy building 
communities as an industry leader in home-
ownership counseling, operating programs in 
40 sites throughout the country. Its Charter 
School Development Initiative has helped cre-
ate more than 40 new schools and strengthen 
more than 45 others, and its Institute for His-
panic Health develops and implements health 
education and prevention programs and con-
ducts health advocacy activities in partnership 
with its network of affiliates. 
with the IRS. The Act also provides for over-
sight over facilitators of high cost tax refund 
anticipation loans and other tax refund delivery 
products, and significantly increases penalties 
on preparers of fraudulent tax returns. 
Finally, this bill includes several provisions 
that would improve IRS taxpayer services. 
One important provision provides greater pro-
tections for taxpayers when they are faced 
with a Notice of a Federal Tax Lien filing 
(NFTL). Filing of an NFTL can result in signifi-
cant, long-term hardship to a taxpayer, and 
may adversely affect the taxpayer’s credit, 
thus impairing his or her ability to conduct fi-
nancial transactions or secure employment. 
The Taxpayer Bill of Rights Act requires the 
IRS to make individualized determinations be-
fore the filing of an NFTL, and also requires 
consideration of hardship factors and a tax-
payer’s history of compliance before these de-
terminations are made. 
Many of the problems identified in this bill 
have gone unaddressed for too long, causing 
confusion and undue hardship for taxpayers 
across the country. I encourage all of my col-
leagues to support these common sense pro-
visions to promote taxpayer rights and serv-
ices for all Americans. 
f 
OUR UNCONSCIONABLE NATIONAL 
DEBT 
NCLR’s education component is dedicated 
to increasing educational opportunities, im-
proving achievement, supporting college-readi-
ness, and promoting equity in outcomes for 
Latinos. The efforts of the education team 
build the capacity and strengthen the quality of 
the community-based education sector and in-
form the broader public education system. 
HON. MIKE COFFMAN 
OF COLORADO 
NCLR’s economic and workforce advocacy 
seeks to ensure the Latino community’s ability 
to contribute to and share in the nation’s eco-
nomic opportunities by promoting policies that 
boost Hispanic employment in good jobs, pro-
vide safe and fair workplaces, bridge Latino 
workers’ education and skills gaps, and offer a 
secure retirement. 
With the Raza Development Fund, NCLR’s 
community development lending arm is one of 
the nation’s largest and most successful com-
munity development banks. It has approved 
more than 117 loans totaling $54.6 million, 
leveraging more than $267 million in financing 
to community-based housing projects, schools, 
health clinics, and day care centers.

Mr. COFFMAN of Colorado. Mr. Speaker, 
on January 20, 2009, the day President 
Obama took office, the national debt was 
$10,626,877,048,913.08. 
Today, it is $15,778,950,543,472.67. We’ve 
added $5,152,073,494,559.59 to our debt in 
just over 3 years. This is debt our nation, our 
economy, and our children could have avoided 
with a balanced budget amendment. 
On this day in 1919, the Treaty of Versailles 
was signed in Paris, ending World War I. 
Without a balanced budget, the United States 
will no longer be able to bring peace to war-
ring nations.

125TH ANNIVERSARY OF UNITED

HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF 
OF CALIFORNIA 
More recently, in efforts to provide NCLR’s 
affiliates with more direct access to elected of-
ficials in Washington, DC, earlier this year 
NCLR held its first annual NCLR National Ad-
vocacy Day. The event convened affiliate 
members from 22 states who were briefed on 
the most important issues facing Latinos at the 
national level, including education, economic 
mobility, health, and immigration, and who met 
with Members of Congress to educate them 
about the needs of the community.

Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize the 125th Anniversary of United 
Way. 
Founded in 1887, United Way has become 
a celebrated organization committed to im-
proving communities throughout the United 
States and around the world. Through locally 
targeted initiatives, United Way strives to ad-
vance the common good, helping communities 
reach their full potential in the spirit of vol-
unteerism and service. United Way mobilizes 
thousands of individuals and organizations 
worldwide to improve education, help people 
achieve financial stability and promote healthy 
lifestyles in their communities, building the 
foundation for a stronger, healthier society. 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 28, 2012 
Mr. BECERRA. Mr. Speaker, I have intro-
duced the Taxpayer Bill of Rights every Con-
gress since 2008, and today I am proud to in-
troduce the Taxpayer Bill of Rights Act of 
2012, legislation that contains important provi-
sions to improve services for and protect the 
rights of American taxpayers, particularly 
those with modest incomes. Senator Binga-
man of New Mexico, a dedicated advocate for 
taxpayer rights, is introducing companion leg-
islation in the Senate. Many of these provi-
sions are based on proposals from the Na-
tional Taxpayer Advocate, Nina Olson, who 
has long been a champion of improving tax-
payer services and tax administration at the 
Internal Revenue Service (IRS). 
As former Nixon Treasury Secretary William 
Simon said, ‘‘The nation should have a tax 
system that looks like someone designed it on 
purpose.’’ As we look for ways to restructure 
the tax code to make it fairer and more trans-
parent for all taxpayers, it is critical that ideas 
to help improve IRS service and accessibility 
are included in this conversation. Every year, 
millions of taxpayers file their returns with the 
IRS and inevitably issues of tax administration 
come to the forefront. These issues range 
from taxpayers not knowing their legal rights 
when interacting with the IRS, to taxpayers 
enlisting unscrupulous or poorly-trained pre-
parers to help them complete one of their 
most important financial transactions of the 
year. This legislation aims to help prevent tax-
payers from finding themselves in these avoid-
able situations, and to build on and improve 
taxpayer services provided through the IRS. 
The centerpiece of this Act is the require-
ment that Treasury publish a Taxpayer Bill of 
Rights. The Taxpayer Bill of Rights will be be 
a simple and straightforward statement that 
enumerates all taxpayers’ rights and obliga-
tions, as well as reference their location in the 
tax code. As the National Taxpayer Advocate 
explained in her 2011 Report to Congress: ‘‘In 
a time when the IRS will feel pressure to bring 
in additional tax revenue, it is crucial to pro-
vide taxpayers with strong protection for their 
rights.’’ Currently, these rights and obligations 
are scattered throughout the tax code and In-
ternal Revenue Manual, making them neither 
accessible nor written in plain language that 
most taxpayers can understand. 
This Act also helps improve the quality and 
accessibility of tax preparation services and 
advice available to taxpayers in several dif-
ferent ways. First, it builds on the IRS’s initia-
tive to regulate unenrolled tax preparers 
through examination and continuing education 
requirements, for which I have been a long 
time advocate. Implementation of the IRS tax 
return preparer framework is well underway, 
and this legislation will simply codify the exist-
ing authority of the IRS to regulate tax return 
preparers. The Act also helps ensure mod-
erate income taxpayers have access to quali-
fied tax assistance by supporting a grant pro-
gram for free income tax assistance services, 
and by allowing IRS referrals to Low-Income 
Taxpayer Clinics, which provide representation 
to modest income taxpayers in their disputes 
As the Representative for Nevada’s First 
Congressional District, it gives me immense 
pride to recognize the National Council of La 
Raza (NCLR) and the role they play in edu-
cating and training our community members, 
developing community leaders and fighting for 
equal rights and fair representation throughout 
the United States. I am especially pleased to 
welcome NCLR’s members and the tens of 
thousands of attendees for its 2012 annual 
conference to Las Vegas, Nevada. I ask that 
my colleagues join me in recognizing the great 
work of NCLR and wish them a most success-
ful 2012 conference.

verbal. This abuse in the workplace creates a 
hostile work environment, making the organi-
zation vulnerable to lawsuits, decreasing mo-
rale, and reducing productivity. Thus, bullying 
is not only negatively impacting our future in 
the global market, but also our ability to com-
pete today. In short, bullying has national im-
plications and thus requires national attention 
and action.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 26, 2012 
Ms. LINDA T. SA´ NCHEZ of California. 
Madam Speakers, I rise in support of H.R. 
4223, the Safe Doses Act. I am proud to join 
my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in 
supporting this important legislation. 
H.R. 4223 addresses a difficult issue in the 
pharmaceutical supply chain: the theft of med-
ical products. While this body last week 
passed important legislation to protect con-
sumers from counterfeit drugs, there remains 
a real risk from stolen medical goods. 
This is a not a hypothetical exercise, it is a 
real problem. Criminal organizations who steal 
medical products are not concerned with stor-
ing these materials properly, or ensuring that 
they are only sold with a doctor’s prescription. 
Let me give one brief, but telling example: 
In 2009, 128,000 vials of insulin were stolen in

H.R. 4223 is a simple and sensible way to 
give law enforcement and prosecutors a 
stronger set of tools to go after criminal orga-
nizations that are brazenly stealing vital medi-

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 28, 2012 
Mr. RICHARDSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
express my appreciation for the Congressional 
Anti-Bullying Caucus, a new caucus formed to 
heighten congressional awareness and advo-
cate for policies to combat bullying of all kinds, 
from the playground to the elderly care facility. 
Every American is entitled to live, work, and 
recreate in a safe environment, free of fear 
from threats to his or her physical safety and 
mental and emotional security. 
In recent years we have witnessed an ex-
plosion in the number of reported and unre-
ported cases of bullying. It is thirteen million 
children will be bullying victims this year alone. 
It is estimated also that 15 percent of Amer-
ican school children skip school to avoid being 
bullied by schoolmates. This is tragic. Children 
who fear for their safety cannot learn. If they 
do not learn, they will not fulfill their potential. 
If they do not fulfill their position, the nation 
will be deprived of the talent it needs to com-
pete and win in the global economy of the 
21st century. If our children fall behind be-
cause they lack a safe learning environment, 
America falls behind. The Congressional Anti- 
Bullying Caucus aims to do something about. 
Further, bullying jeopardizes not only the 
education of our children, but also their very 
well-being. The term ‘‘bullycide’’ has been 
coined to define the act of committing suicide 
as a result of bullying. This continues to be 
one of the leading causes of death for children 
under the age of 14. In fact, the rate of suicide 
among adolescents has grown more than 50 
percent over the last 30 years. 
Mr. Speaker, unfortunately bullying does not 
end when our children move on from the play-
ground. It exists on college campuses, in the 
workplace, online, and even in elderly care fa-
cilities. Nearly half of Americans have experi-
enced some sort of violence either in their 
workplace, at home, or in their community. 
Hazing on college campuses has been a prob-
lem for decades. Five percent of all college 
students admit to being hazed, with 40 per-
cent admitting that a coach or advisor was 
aware of the hazing and did not intervene. 
This lack of action is unacceptable. Our col-
lege students must have the ability to focus on 
their work and prepare for their futures, with-
out fear of physical or verbal hazing. 
Bullying in the workplace appears in various 
forms, from narcissistic bullying, to physical, to 
I encourage all of my colleagues to support 
this legislation, clean up the pharmaceutical 
supply chain, and protect their constituents.

June 28, 2012 
INTRODUCING A RESOLUTION IN 
SUPPORT OF THE XIX INTER-
NATIONAL AIDS CONFERENCE 
unanimously upheld by the United States Su-
preme Court, Judge Keith’s decision held un-
constitutional wiretap surveillance absent a 
court order in domestic security cases. 
HON. ALCEE L. HASTINGS 
Judge Keith continued to safeguard con-
stitutional rights and civil liberties on the 
United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth 
Circuit, where he has served since his ap-
pointment in 1977 by President James E. Car-
ter. In the 1980s, Judge Keith served as chair 
of Sixth Circuit and Judicial Conference Com-
mittees commemorating the Bicentennial of 
the Constitution. He took senior status in 
1995. 
Judge Keith was born in Detroit, Michigan 
on July 4, 1922 and became the first member 
of his family to attend college, earning a bach-
elor’s degree from West Virginia State Col-
lege. After serving our Nation for three years 
in the U.S. Army, he went on to receive an 
LL.B. from Howard University Law School and 
an LL.M. in labor law from Wayne State Uni-
versity Law School. 
Judge Keith started his legal career with the 
African-American Detroit law firm of Loomis, 
Jones, Piper & Colden and was one of six De-
troit attorneys invited to the White House in 
1963 by President John F. Kennedy to discuss 
the role of lawyers in the civil rights struggle. 
Later, Judge Keith and four other African- 
American attorneys established a law firm in 
what had previously been the all-white legal 
district of downtown Detroit. At this time, 
Judge Keith also served as Chair of the Michi-
gan Civil Rights Commission and President of 
the Detroit Housing Commission. 
during the day and dedicates his time to vol-
unteer as Reserve Deputy Sheriff with the L.A. 
Sheriff’s Department at night. 
At 3 a.m. on January 2, 2012, Deputy Sher-
iff Lalezary became a local hero and a na-
tional sensation when he captured Harry 
Burkhart, a 24-year-old German national 
whom Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca 
called ‘‘perhaps . . . the most dangerous ar-
sonist in the county of Los Angeles.’’ Burkhart 
was arrested for setting a rash of car and 
building fires across the city. Following his ar-
rest, there were no more suspicious fires doc-
umented in Los Angeles. 
Deputy Sheriff Lalezary is a hero who dem-
onstrates exemplary values and integrity and 
most-importantly inspires his peers. During his 
numerous press conferences, public events, 
and even an appearance on the TV show 
‘‘Ellen,’’ he has continued to impress us with 
his selfless dedication and altruism. He contin-
ually downplays his role in the arrest, deflect-
ing questions about himself and his personal 
life, and praising the deputies at the sheriff’s 
West Hollywood station. 
Shervin’s commitment to serving Los Ange-
les and keeping us safe reflects the Jewish 
value of tikkun olam and the importance of 
giving back to our country. 30 Years After, an 
Iranian-American non-profit organization that 
promotes civic participation, rightfully pre-
sented Shervin with the 2012 Public Service 
Award on behalf of 30 Years After and the 
Persian-American community. 
Mr. Speaker and distinguished colleagues, 
we ask you to join us in recognizing Deputy 
Sheriff Shervin Lalezary for his years of serv-
ice and dedication to the safety and well being 
of our community. He is the epitome of a true 
humanitarian.

HONORING THE SERVICE OF 
JUDGE DAMON J. KEITH 
HON. JOHN CONYERS, JR. 
OF MICHIGAN 
Throughout his distinguished career, Judge 
Keith has received numerous honors and 
awards, including: the National Association for 
the Advancement of Colored People’s highest 
award, the Spingarn Medal, in 1974; the 
American Bar Association’s Thurgood Marshall 
Award in 1997; and, the Edward J. Devitt 
Award for Distinguished Service to Justice in 
1998, presented by a panel comprised of a 
United States Supreme Court Justice, a fed-
eral circuit court judge, and a federal district 
court judge. 
Judge Keith also holds honorary degrees 
from Harvard University, Yale University, 
Georgetown University, the University of 
Michigan, Tuskegee University, and over thirty 
other institutions. 
In addition, Judge Keith has played an ac-
tive role in numerous civic, cultural, and edu-
cational organizations, including the Detroit 
YMCA, the Detroit Arts Commission, the De-
troit Cotillion Club, and Interlochen Arts Acad-
emy, and has served as an active fundraiser 
for the United Negro College Fund and the 
Detroit NAACP. 
For fifty-three years, Judge Keith was mar-
ried to the late Rachel Boone Keith, M.D., with 
whom he had three daughters, Gilda, Debbie, 
and Cecile. 
For his consistent defense of the Constitu-
tion and the civil rights of all people, on his 
90th birthday, I honor and thank Judge Keith 
for his invaluable service to the United States.

Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor 
the career and service to the United States of 
Judge Damon J. Keith on the occasion of his 
90th birthday. 
Since joining the federal judiciary, Judge 
Keith has steadfastly and courageously pro-
tected the constitutional and civil rights of this 
country’s citizens. 
In 1967, President Lyndon Johnson ap-
pointed Judge Keith to the U.S. District Court 
for the Eastern District of Michigan, making 
him only the second African-American to sit on 
that court at that time. During his tenure on 
the District Court, Judge Keith delivered sev-
eral key civil rights rulings. He addressed the 
issue of school desegregation in Davis v. 
School District of the City of Pontiac in 1970; 
of employment discrimination and affirmative 
action in Stamps v. Detroit Edison Co., in 
1973 and Baker v. City of Detroit in 1979; and 
finally, of housing discrimination in Garrett v. 
City of Hamtramck in 1971 and Zuch v. 
Hussey in 1975. Judge Keith became Chief 
Judge of the Eastern District of Michigan in 
1975. 
In 1971, Judge Keith issued a landmark civil 
liberties ruling in U.S. v. Sinclair, which came 
to be known as the ‘‘Keith decision.’’ Later 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 28, 2012 
Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to introduce a resolution in support 
of the XIX International AIDS Conference 
(AIDS 2012), which takes place from July 22, 
2012, through July 27, 2012, at the Walter E. 
Washington Convention Center in Washington, 
DC. This year’s conference is of particular sig-
nificance, as it represents the return of the 
International AIDS Conference to the United 
States after the 1987 HIV travel and immigra-
tion ban was lifted in 2010. My resolution sup-
ports a stronger international response to HIV/ 
AIDS that seeks to foster greater scientific and 
programmatic collaborations around the world 
in order to prevent the transmission of HIV; in-
crease access to testing, treatment, and care; 
and improve health outcomes for all people 
living with HIV/AIDS. 
There are currently 33.4 million people living 
with HIV/AIDS worldwide, and more than 25 
million have died of AIDS since the first cases 
were reported in 1981. In the United States, 
more than one million people are living with 
HIV/AIDS and approximately 50,000 individ-
uals become newly infected with the virus 
each year. Furthermore, one in five individuals 
living with HIV is unaware of their infection 
and societal stigma remains a significant chal-
lenge, underscoring the need for greater edu-
cation about HIV/AIDS and access to testing. 
Significant disparities also persist across di-
verse communities and populations with re-
gard to incidence, access to treatment, and 
health outcomes, particularly for men who 
have sex with men (MSM), racial and ethnic 
minorities, women, and young people. 
Since 1985, the now biennial International 
AIDS Conference has brought together the 
world’s leading scientists, public health ex-
perts, policymakers, community leaders, and 
persons living with HIV/AIDS in order to ad-
dress the major issues facing the global re-
sponse to HIV/AIDS; evaluate recent scientific 
developments and share knowledge; and fa-
cilitate a collective strategy forward. AIDS 
2012 is organized by the International AIDS 
Society (IAS) and expected to convene more 
than 20,000 delegates from nearly 200 coun-
tries, including 2,000 journalists. The theme of 
AIDS 2012, ‘‘Turning the Tide Together,’’ em-
bodies both the promise and urgency of uti-
lizing recent scientific advances in HIV/AIDS 
treatment and biomedical prevention; con-
tinuing research for an HIV vaccine and cure; 
and scaling up effective, evidence-based inter-
ventions in key settings in order to change the 
course of the HIV/AIDS crisis. 
AIDS 2012 is a tremendous opportunity to 
further strengthen the role of the United States 
in global HIV/AIDS initiatives; re-energize the 
response to the domestic epidemic within the 
current context of significant global economic 
challenges; and focus particular attention on 
the devastating impact that HIV is having on 
different communities across the country. My 
resolution supports the goal of bringing re-
newed awareness of, and commitment to, ad-
dressing the HIV/AIDS crisis in the United 
States and abroad. In particular, it recognizes

that formulating sound public health policy; 
protecting human rights; advancing sexual and 
reproductive health and rights; addressing 
stigma, poverty, and other societal challenges; 
and ensuring accountability are key to over-
coming HIV/AIDS. It also encourages the on-
going development of innovative therapies and 
advances in clinical treatment for HIV/AIDS in 
the public and private sectors. 
Mr. Speaker, continued commitment by the 
United States to HIV/AIDS research, preven-
tion, and treatment programs is crucial to pro-
tecting global health. I urge my colleagues to 
support my resolution, which recognizes the 
importance of the XIX International AIDS Con-
ference in the global effort to end the HIV/ 
AIDS pandemic and create an ‘‘AIDS-free 
generation.’’ We are closer to a future without 
HIV/AIDS than ever before. Together with the 
international community, we have the means 
to bring an end to HIV/AIDS once and for all. 
What we need now is leadership and soli-
darity.

In addition to his professional interests, Dr. 
Glaser had a lifelong passion for the commer-
cial airline industry. Over the years, said his 
daughter, Sally Glaser, Ph.D., ‘‘He and one of 
my brothers would often sit out in the back- 
yard, listening to air traffic control communica-
tions as they looked at the approaching air-
craft through binoculars.’’ He was an avid trav-
eler, logging more than five million miles in air 
travel for both professional and pleasure trips, 
including his last trip to Harvard in 2010 to at-
tend his 70th college reunion. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me 
in extending our deepest condolences to Dr. 
Glaser’s three children, his four grandchildren, 
his colleagues and his students who knew and 
loved him throughout his extraordinary life. Dr. 
Glaser was a kind man, a brilliant doctor and 
a masterful educator. His life stands as an in-

am submitting the following letter exchange for 
the RECORD between myself and Chairman 
DAVE CAMP of the House Committee on Ways 
and Means: 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
Washington, DC, June 27, 2012. 
Hon. PETER KING, 
Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security, 
House of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRMAN KING: I am writing to you 
concerning the bill H.R. 4251, the ‘‘Securing 
Maritime Activities through Risk-based Tar-
geting for Port Security Act.’’ This legisla-
tion includes several provisions in section 
201 that pertain to the jurisdiction of the 
Committee on Ways & Means with respect to 
Customs and Border Protection’s mission of 
facilitating the efficient flow of legitimate 
commerce. 
The Committee recognizes the importance 
of H.R. 4251 and the need to move expedi-
tiously. Therefore, the Committee is willing 
to forego action on the bill with the under-
standing that by doing so, the Committee is 
not in any way prejudiced with respect to its 
jurisdictional prerogatives or the appoint-
ment of conferees on this or similar legisla-
tion. 
In addition, I appreciate your agreement 
that the Ways & Means Committee be in-
cluded within the definition of ‘‘appropriate 
congressional committees’’ so that it will re-
ceive the implementation and strategic 
plans required in section 201 of the bill.

letter, confirming this understanding with 
respect to H.R. 4251, and would ask that a

Thursday, June 28, 2012 
Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the extraordinary life of Dr. Robert J. 
Glaser, former Dean of the Stanford University 
School of Medicine and a national figure in 
medical education. Dr. Glaser passed away on 
June 7, 2012, at his home in Palo Alto, sur-
rounded by his family. Dr. Glaser, who was 93 
years old, is survived by three children; Sally, 
Joseph Glaser II and Robert Glaser, Jr., and 
four grandchildren. His beloved wife Helen 
Glaser passed away in 1999. 
Dr. Glaser was born and raised in St. Louis. 
He received his undergraduate degree from 
Harvard College in 1940 and his M.D., magna 
cum laude, from Harvard Medical School in 
1943. He then returned to St. Louis to do his 
residency at Barnes Hospital of Washington 
University School of Medicine. 
While at Barnes, his ‘‘wandering eye fixed 
on an attractive young woman in the senior 
class,’’ he wrote in his Harvard 25th reunion 
memoir. The medical student and soon-to-be 
pediatrician was Helen Hofsommer, M.D. She 
would become Glaser’s wife. 
After their wedding, the couple spent the 
next eight years in St. Louis, while Dr. Glaser 
moved through the ranks at Washington Uni-
versity, rising from Instructor to Associate Pro-
fessor to Assistant Dean and Associate Dean 
of the Medical School. In 1956, he accepted 
the position of Dean of Medical School and 
Vice President for Medical Affairs at the Uni-
versity of Colorado. In 1963, he was tapped to 
lead Affiliated Hospitals Center Inc., in Boston, 
an ambitious, $50 million merger of six Har-
vard-affiliated hospitals. 
In 1965, he was named the Dean of the 
Stanford School of Medicine, which had 
moved from San Francisco to Palo Alto. 
‘‘Though he came after the move, he was the 
one who shepherded the school through its 
formative years to get everything settled—get 
the molecules in motion,’’ said James B.D. 
Mark, M.D., who arrived at Stanford the same 
year. ‘‘He was a leader at a critical time in the 
life of this medical school.’’ Dr. Mark described 
Dr. Glaser as someone who had ‘‘great en-
ergy, great experience, high standards and 
worked hard.’’ Paul Berg, Ph.D., said Dr. 
Glaser was a caring person who was ‘‘easy to 
talk to. It was always fun to talk to him. And 
he was very devoted to the school.’’ 
At the time, the hospital on campus was co- 
owned by the city of Palo Alto. As Dean and 
Vice President for Medical Affairs at Stanford, 
Dr. Glaser oversaw the purchase of the city’s 
share of the Palo Alto-Stanford Hospital in 
1968. ‘‘Dr. Robert Glaser was an extraordinary 
figure in American medicine and at Stanford 
specifically,’’ said Philip Pizzo, M.D., the cur-
rent Dean of the Stanford School of Medicine. 
‘‘Dr. Glaser’s vision shaped Stanford Medicine 
as we know it today, and his contributions 
have had an indelible mark on individuals, in-
stitutions and communities, locally and glob-
ally.’’ 
Dr. Glaser was tapped to serve as Acting 
President of Stanford University following the 
retirement of Dr. J.E. Wallace Sterling. He led 
the University at a tumultuous time of student 
protests against the war in Vietnam and was 
lauded by students for his sensitivity and re-
sponsiveness. At the medical school, Dr. 
Glaser also oversaw major changes in the cur-
riculum to give students greater flexibility—a 
feature that remains a hallmark of the cur-
riculum today. Even into his 90s, Dr. Glaser 
continued to attend medical grand rounds and 
teaching conferences. 
After serving as Dean for five years, Dr. 
Glaser left Stanford in 1970 to serve as Vice 
President and Trustee at the Commonwealth 
Fund, a New York-based philanthropy devoted 
to improving health care. ‘‘Before he left for 
the Commonwealth Fund, his line was, ‘I’m 
going to see if it’s better to give, than not to 
receive,’ ’’ said Dr. Mark, recalling Glaser’s dry 
wit. 
He subsequently went on to serve as Presi-
dent, Chief Executive Officer and Trustee of 
the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation from 
1972 through 1983. From 1984–97, he was 
Director for Medical Science and Trustee of 
the Lucille P. Markey Charitable Trust, where 
he oversaw distribution of more than $500 mil-
lion in support of medical science research, in-
cluding the establishment of the Markey Trust 
Scholar Program. 
Dr. Glaser also had a long-term involvement 
with the Palo Alto Medical Foundation. Initially 
engaged through its research institute, in 1981 
he became a founding member of its Board of 
Trustees and continued as an Emeritus Trust-
ee through 2008. 
A member of Alpha Omega Alpha, he 
served on its Board of Directors and as the 
Editor from 1962–97 of its scholarly journal 
The Pharos, while his wife served as Man-
aging Editor. 
Dr. Robert Glaser was also active nationally 
in medical education through the Association 
of American Medical Colleges and served on 
the National Advisory Committee on Higher 
Education. He was a founding member of the 
Institute of Medicine of the National Academy 
of Sciences and served on the boards of 
many organizations, including Washington 
University, the David and Lucile Packard 
Foundation, the Packard Humanities Institute, 
the Albert and Mary Lasker Foundation, the 
Kaiser Hospitals and Health Plan, Hewlett- 
Packard and Alza Corp.

In addition to my concerns about this arrest, 
it has come to my attention that the Tribunal 
itself is inherently flawed and lacks compliance 
with international standards. It appears that 
the Tribunal is international in name only, as 
it lacks international oversight or involvement, 
experienced foreign attorneys have been 
banned from participating, and the Tribunal 
violates at least two of Bangladesh’s inter-
national treaty obligations. Tribunal defendants 
are not only denied access to international 
standards of justice, but several of the rights 
granted by domestic law. These include the 
right to an independent appeal, which is ex-
plicitly denied to defendants of the Tribunal. 
As a member of the Middle East and South 
Asia subcommittee, I am very concerned 
about the implications that Mir Quasem Ali’s 
arrest has for the state of democracy within 
Bangladesh. I will continue to closely monitor 
this situation and I hope that Bangladesh will 
take assertive measures to ensure that its up-
coming elections are conducted in a openly 
democratic matter. I am hopeful for a bright fu-
ture for the people of Bangladesh with open 
and fair justice for all of its citizens.

forgoing action on this legislation, your 
Committee is not diminishing or altering its

I also concur with you that forgoing action 
on this bill does not in any way prejudice the

to its jurisdictional prerogatives on this bill 
or similar legislation in the future. I agree 
that the Committee on Ways and Means is

Mr. JOHNSON of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I 
was present for rollcall No. 431 and 433, and 
was off the floor talking with constituents from 
Douglas and Piatt Counties, and inadvertently 
missed the vote. I support the fiscal savings 
attendant to this amendment but had concerns 
over its language. Therefore, if present, I 
would have voted ‘‘Present.’’

TRIBUTE TO RICHARD COLEMAN 
KELLEY 
It is hard to imagine that Richard had any 
free time on his hands, and yet he always 
found time for his community and family. Rich-
ard was active in his church, was vice presi-
dent of the Riverside County Farm Bureau, 
president of the Hemet Optimist Club, was ac-
tive in parent-teacher organizations, and sup-
ported every team and club in which his chil-
dren participated. He also served on the board 
of Eastern Municipal Water District (EMWD) 
beginning in September of 1981, serving on 
the Legal Committee and as Chairman of the 
Building and Grounds Committee. Richard 
also enjoyed inventing, skiing, jogging, and 
farming. In fact, many of Richard and 
Jeanne’s ‘‘vacations’’ were spent helping work 
on their daughter’s and son’s farms in Idaho. 
In response to the high water costs that 
could have forced small farmers out of busi-
ness in the early 1980s, Richard once said, 
‘‘Agricultural water is my main interest . . . 
something has to be done.’’ And as an EMWD 
board member and concerned citizen, he 
worked tirelessly to address this threat to an 
American way of life. That is just one testa-
ment to his can-do spirit and willingness to 
help solve problems in his home town that 
made him such a treasure to the Riverside 
County area for so long, and is what we will 
remember about him most. 
On Wednesday, June 27, 2012, a memorial 
service celebrating Richard’s extraordinary life 
was held. Richard will always be remembered 
for his legendary work ethic, generosity, con-
tributions to the community, and love of family. 
His dedication to his work, family, and commu-
nity are a testament to a life well-lived and a 
legacy that will continue. I extend my deepest 
condolences to Richard’s family and friends. 
Although Richard may be gone, the light and 
goodness he brought to our great State will 
never be diminished and will never be forgot-
ten. 
Richard is survived by his children, Janice 
of Hemet, Kathy of Weiser, Idaho and Ron of 
Weiser, Idaho; five grandchildren; and his 
brother, former California State Assemblyman 
and Senator, David Kelley. Our thoughts and 
prayers are with Richard’s family and the 
many others he touched.

HON. MARY BONO MACK 
JUSTICE FOR MIR QUASEM ALI 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 28, 2012 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speak-
er, last week, as a Member of the House For-
eign Affairs Committee, Subcommittee on the 
Middle East and South Asia, I met Mir Ahmad 
BinQuasem of Bangladesh. Mir Ahmad in-
formed me that his father, Mir Quasem Ali, 
was arrested on June 17, 2012, by the Ban-
gladesh International, War, Crimes Tribunal for 
alleged crimes committed during the 1971 War 
of Liberation against then-West Pakistan, and 
for campaigning ‘‘against the process of this 
[War Crimes] Tribunal in foreign countries.’’ 
Mir Quasem Ali is the owner of Bangladesh’s 
largest opposition-run media outlet, which has 
been openly critical of the Tribunal and of the 
ruling government at-large. As such, I am con-
cerned that his arrest and ongoing detention 
may represent a thinly-veiled attempt by the 
ruling government of Bangladesh to silence its 
opponents and critics. 
OF CALIFORNIA

Mrs. BONO MACK. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to join my colleague and friend, Con-
gressman KEN CALVERT, to honor and pay trib-
ute to a dear friend, Richard Coleman Kelley. 
Richard passed away on Thursday, June 14, 
2012. A devoted husband, brother, father, and 
grandfather, he will be deeply missed. 
Richard was born March 19, 1930 in Co-
rona, California to David and Margaret Kelley, 
who were beginning to develop their property 
in Hemet into a citrus grove. He attended 
schools in Corona, and after graduating from 
the Army and Navy Academy in Carlsbad, 
California, he served honorably in the United 
States Air Force from 1950 to 1954. He spent 
a semester at the University of California at 
Davis before returning to work for his father on 
their family’s ranch, only to later develop a cit-
rus ranch of his own. In 1957, Richard married 
Jeanne Vig and continued to farm in Hemet 
while raising their three children, where he 
was partner of Kelley Citrus and owned Circle 
K Five Citrus. 
OF MASSACHUSETTS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 28, 2012 
Mr. MARKEY. Mr. Speaker, I have declined 
to add my signature to the Conference Report 
to accompany H.R. 4348, legislation to reau-
thorize the highway trust fund. 
While the highway bill has traditionally been 
the product of reasonable, bipartisan com-
promise, the House Republican’s version of 
this year’s bill was so extreme the Conference 
Report was hobbled from the start. 
House Republicans took the jobs and eco-
nomic development promised by this highway 
bill hostage—with unrelated provisions like the 
Keystone pipeline as the ransom—and the 
Senate had no choice but to negotiate with the 
hostage takers. 
Provisions allocating critical conservation 
funding across the country, through the Land 
and Water Conservation Fund and a National 
Endowment for the Oceans, was struck from 
the Conference Report; only funding for the 
five Gulf States—Alabama, Mississippi, Lou-
isiana, Florida and Texas—has survived. That 
funding will certainly be beneficial but the 
broader conservation programs should have 
been included, as well. 
The Conference Report also includes provi-
sions prohibiting the National Park Service 
from complying with the law limiting the im-
pacts of aircraft noise on Grand Canyon Na-
tional Park. Why we would want to use a 
transportation bill to make one of the crown 
jewels of the National Park System louder and 
dirtier is a mystery. 
Most troubling, the Conference Report in-
cludes unjustified and harmful provisions 
which will undermine environmental reviews of 
highway and transit projects. Republicans 
have claimed environmental reviews delay 
highway projects but the facts are that most 
transportation projects already proceed under 
expedited environmental reviews and there is 
no evidence whatsoever that these reviews 
cause delay.

founder of the iconic Chris Craft boat com-
pany—set a world water speed record at a 
club organized boat race. 
The Saint Paul Yacht Club has remained in 
continuous operation since 1912, and currently 
manages two state of the art harbor facilities 
within the jewel of the Saint Paul public 
parks—Harriet Island Regional Park—on the 
Mississippi River in the city’s downtown. 
Today, the harbor remains a hub of activity, 
hosting 230 boat slips for vessels that are up 
to 50 feet long, and serving as home to a 
thriving year-round live-aboard and seasonal 
boating community. Boaters come from near 
and far to enjoy the tremendous views of Saint 
Paul and the surrounding natural beauty of the 
Mississippi River National River Recreation 
Area. 
Throughout its century of service to the 
boating public, the Saint Paul Yacht Club has 
served as a model of responsible stewardship 
to Minnesota waterways. By promoting safe 
and accessible boating activities, the club has 
provided a tremendous service to many Saint 
Paul residents and visitors. The Saint Paul 
Yacht Club is truly an exemplary asset to our 
city and state. 
Mr. Speaker, in honor of the 100th Anniver-
sary of the Saint Paul Yacht Club, it is a privi-
lege to submit this statement for the CONGRES-
SIONAL RECORD.

URBAN DEVELOPMENT, AND RE-

SPEECH OF 
HON. LAURA RICHARDSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
Nevertheless, the Conference Report in-
cludes several broad new categorical exclu-
sions from the National Environmental Policy 
Act, or NEPA. These new exclusions lack 
flexibility or adequate standards and will limit 
public participation and careful consideration 
of transportation projects that can have dev-
astating impacts on neighborhoods and our 
natural, cultural and historic resources. In the 
end, the purpose of these provisions is to 
speed up highway construction, not by cutting 
alleged ‘‘red-tape’’ but by making it harder for 
local communities to gather information and 
have input in projects that may go right 
through their backyards. 
Unbelievably, the Conference Report also 
includes a radical new idea that agencies 
should be fined, through rescission of up to 7 
percent of their budgets, for missing arbitrary 
deadlines for environmental reviews. Given 
that the main reason agencies struggle to 
complete these reviews quickly is a lack of 
funding and staff, cutting their budgets as pun-
ishment will only make the problem worse. 
Inclusion of funding for the Secure Rural 
Schools and the Payment in Lieu of Taxes 
programs are positive steps, while removal of 
divisive, unrelated provisions on coal ash and 
the Keystone Pipeline are welcome improve-
ments, compared to the House Republican 
bill. 
Finally, the process used to develop this 
Conference Report was unfortunate. Con-
ferees have been asked to sign an agreement 
we have had little or no time to review and the 
substance of the agreement was negotiated 
largely without input from most conferees. 
This Conference Report will harm those liv-
ing and working near transportation projects in 
the future and fails to address some of the 
most pressing conservation needs facing this 
nation. We can and should do better.

100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ST. 
PAUL YACHT CLUB 
HON. BETTY McCOLLUM 
OF MINNESOTA 
District of California for an enlightened trans-
portation policy that will position the United 
States to compete and win in the global econ-
omy of the 21st Century. Since many amend-
ments will have to be considered before the 
vote on final passage, I am reserving my final 
judgment as to how I will cast my vote. Never-
theless, I would like to take a moment to com-
mend Mr. LATHAM and Mr. OLVER, the Chair 
and Ranking Member of the Subcommittee, 
for their work, including nine major funding re-
quests that I submitted to the Committee in 
the bill reported to the House. Specifically the 
bill includes the following: 
Community 
Development 
Block 
Grant 
(CDBG) Program. CDBG is the centerpiece of 
the federal governments efforts to help more 
than 1200 cities, counties and states meet the 
needs of their low and moderate-income peo-
ple and communities. It revitalizes commu-
nities—with proven results. CDBG helps fund 
a wide range of activities including housing in-
vestments, public infrastructure improvements, 
public services, and local economic develop-
ment projects where the private market is ab-
sent. The Committee recommended $3.344 
billion, which was $44 million above my re-
quest. 
Fair Housing Initiatives Program. FHIP is a 
competitive grant program and is the primary 
source of funding for fair housing education 
and enforcement activities at the local level. 
Local fair housing organizations funded by 
FHIP protect the housing rights of the public 
and educate people about their fair housing 
rights. The program is vital given the extreme 
fragility that currently exists in the housing 
market. The Committee met my request by 
continuing funding at the FY12 level of $42.5 
million. 
Tenant Based Rental Assistance Program. 
HUD’s Section 8 programs help low-income 
elderly, families with children, and people with 
disabilities secure and maintain decent, afford-
able homes. In both urban and rural commu-
nities, Section 8 rental assistance provides the 
foundation for millions of individuals and fami-
lies to live with dignity, maintain steady work, 
and improve the lives of their children. The 
Committee recommended approximately $19.1 
billion for this program, or $60 million above 
my request. 
Community Planning and Development from 
the Department of Housing and Urban Devel-
opment. HUD’s The Office of Community 
Planning and Development (CPD) seeks to 
develop viable communities by promoting inte-
grated approaches that provide decent hous-
ing, a suitable living environment, and expand 
economic opportunities for low and moderate 
income persons. The primary means towards 
this end is the development of partnerships 
among all levels of government and the pri-
vate sector, including for-profit and non-profit 
organizations. The Committee recommended 
$103.5 million. Although this was slightly 
below my request, it exceeded the FY12 level 
of funding by $3.5 million. 
Indian 
Community 
Development 
Block 
Grant. The Indian Community Development 
Block Grant (ICDBG) program provides com-
petitive grants to Indian tribes and Alaska Na-
tive villages for housing, community facilities, 
and economic development. ICDGB funds 
community infrastructure like roads and sewer 
systems that improve the quality of available 
housing units while making new housing more 
affordable and accessible. The Committee met 
my request of $60 million. 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 28, 2012 
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, today I rise 
to honor the Saint Paul Yacht Club in honor of 
the 100th Anniversary of the organization. For 
a century, this venerable institution has been 
providing safe and affordable boating opportu-
nities to residents of Saint Paul and sur-
rounding communities. 
Since 1912, the Saint Paul Yacht Club has 
played a central role promoting and providing 
access to Minnesota’s premier waterways. 
Originally known as the Saint Paul Motorboat 
Club, the early club served an active and 
growing speed boating population on all three 
of Minnesota’s major rivers, the Mississippi, 
the Minnesota, and the Saint Croix. Early 
members could rent boat slips for 10 cents per 
foot, and purchase gasoline for 10 cents per 
gallon. To retrieve the gasoline, 5 gallon cans 
were lowered by a rope from the Wabasha 
Bridge to the boaters on the water. 
In addition to providing helpful services to its 
members, the Saint Paul Yacht Club orga-
nized picnics, boat races and other social and 
recreational events. Boat races were particu-
larly popular in the 1920s and 1930s. On one 
occasion, 
Christopher

The House in Committee of the Whole 
House on the state of the Union had under 
consideration the bill (H.R. 5972) making ap-
propriations for the Departments of Trans-
portation, and Housing and Urban Develop-
ment, and related agencies for the fiscal year 
ending September 30, 2013, and for other pur-
poses: 
Ms. RICHARDSON. Mr. Chair, later this 
week, the House is scheduled to consider 
H.R. 5972, the Transportation & Housing and 
Urban Development (THUD) Appropriations 
Art for Fiscal Year 2013. This bill funds the 
agencies that address our nation’s housing 
and transportation needs, and is one of the 
most important pieces of legislation the House 
will consider this year. The THUD bill rep-
resents a tremendous opportunity to improve 
our economic competitiveness and ensure the 
wellbeing of working Americans, and I rise to 
offer some preliminary observations on the bill 
that will be debated over the next several 
days. 
I serve as a proud Member of the House

initiatives and grant programs covered in this 
bill.

provide the opportunity for farmers to share in-
formation in an informal setting and discuss 
current, local issues with special guest speak-
ers, the Bureau has continued to make com-
munity outreach a top priority. It is also in-
volved in promoting the Blossom Trail, the 
Fruit Trail and the Big Fresno Fair, and annu-
ally recognizes deserving reporters and editors 
for conveying accurate and objective reporting 
about agricultural issues and the industry. 
On top of these important efforts, the Farm 
Bureau offers valuable agriculture education 
and leadership development assistance in the 
community. The annual Farm and Nutrition 
Day is put on for more than 1,500 third-grad-
ers, providing facts about food and fiber pro-
duction in Fresno County. In addition, rep-
resentatives from the Farm Bureau are on- 
hand during the annual Fair Education Pro-
gram to conduct mini-presentations about agri-
culture for students. The Fresno County Farm 
Bureau also works with local universities and 
conducts classroom presentations. In addition 
to this, the Future Advocates for Agriculture 
Concerned about Tomorrow (FAACT) Leader-
ship Development Program provides commu-
nity leaders with a comprehensive eight-month 
class, highlighting specific issue areas in agri-
culture. FAACT offers a balanced, factual 
presentation of several issue areas specific to 
agriculture. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me 
in recognizing the Fresno County Farm Bu-
reau as it celebrates its 95th anniversary and 
prepares to continue to provide outstanding 
leadership for the agriculture industry through-
out the Central Valley, the State of California, 
and our nation.

Native American Housing Block Grants. In-
dian Housing Block Grants go directly to trib-
ally designated housing entities (TDHEs) for 
housing development, housing services for eli-
gible families, crime prevention and safety, 
and demonstration projects that provide cre-
ative approaches to solving affordable housing 
shortages. TDHEs must submit an Indian 
Housing Plan each year they receive funding, 
followed by an end-of-year Annual Perform-
ance Report to report on progress towards 
meeting their goals. The Committee rec-
ommended $650 million for these grants, 
thereby meeting my request. 
HUD–VASH Program. HUD–VASH is the 
only program that supports the permanent 
housing and rehabilitation of homeless vet-
erans. HUD–VASH is a joint HUD and VA ini-
tiative that provides specially designated Sec-
tion 8 ‘‘Housing Choice’’ vouchers, case man-
agement, and supportive services to homeless 
veterans. Vouchers are used to assist with the 
payment of rent for veterans and their families. 
The goal of the program is to support vet-
erans’ permanent housing in the community. 
The Committee’s recommendation was equal 
to my request of $75 million. 
Maritime Security Program. The Maritime 
Security Program ensures that the United 
States has the U.S.-flag commercial sealift ca-
pability and trained U.S. citizen merchant 
mariners available to crew the government 
and privately-owned vessels needed by the 
Department of Defense in time of war or other 
international 
emergency. 
The 
Committee 
matched my request of $184 million, which in-
creased funding over FY12 levels by $10 mil-
lion. 
Housing for the Elderly (Section 202) Cap-
ital Advance Program. Capital advances fi-
nance construction, rehabilitation, or acquisi-
tion of structures that will serve as supportive 
housing for very low-income elderly persons. 
Section 202 provides rent subsidies for 
projects to help keep them affordable for these 
vulnerable populations. We recommend rein-
stating funding to allow affordable special 
needs housing developers to provide sup-
portive housing options for the elderly, particu-
larly within AANHPI enclaves. The Committee 
exceeded my request for funding by allocating 
$425 million. 
Mr. Chair, I again extend my sincere thanks 
to Chairman LATHAM and Ranking Member 
OLVER for their careful consideration of my ap-
propriations requests. While I reserve my final 
judgment on this bill, I do believe that the full 
funding of these programs and departments 
will make a real difference in boosting the 
economy and improving the lives of vulnerable 
communities.

OF

FRESNO 
COUNTY FARM BUREAU 
HON. JIM COSTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 28, 2012 
Mr. BERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
pay tribute to Dorit and Shawn Evenhaim for 
their generosity and dedication to help the less 
fortunate as well as provide the highest pos-
sible quality of education in our community. 
Dorit and Shawn Evenhaim are Israeli 
Angelenos that own and operate California 
Home Builders. Both Dorit and Shawn grew 
up in Southern Israel where they learned the 
Jewish value of tzedakah, the act of charitable 
giving and helping the less fortunate. They 
came to the United States following their serv-
ice in the Israeli military and continued to 
practice this philanthropy. They have contrib-
uted countless hours of community service 
and provided leadership to many charitable or-
ganizations throughout the San Fernando Val-
ley such as the Israeli Leadership Council, the 
Jewish Federation, and StandWithUs. 
In 2004, Kadima, a 34-year-old Solomon 
Schecter Conservative day school in the West 
San Fernando Valley, had to relocate when 
LAUSD needed the campus that Kadima had 
been leasing. The Evenhaim’s generous dona-
tion provided the resources for Kadima to pur-
chase a former hospital about a mile away 
from the previous campus. 
The Evenhaim’s involvement did not end 
with their donation. They were also instru-
mental in locating the site for the new campus, 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 28, 2012 
Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ex-
tend my sincerest congratulations to the Fres-
no County Farm Bureau which is celebrating 
its 95th anniversary this year. Since its estab-
lishment in 1917, the organization has contin-
ued to evolve. It began as general farm orga-
nization as an arm of the Agriculture Exten-
sion Service, and is now at the forefront of 
farming in California. As it nears the end of its 
first century, it continues to lead the agri-
culture industry and the community in ad-
dressing issues that result in long-term eco-
nomic viability for agriculture and promoting 
the economic vitality of the region as we move 
forward in the 21st Century. 
The Farm Bureau started shortly after the 
Smith-Lever Act of 1914 established the Agri-
culture Extension Service. The Act stipulated 
that before a county could obtain farm advisor 
services, it had to form a general farm organi-
zation through which the Extension Service 
could disseminate information and promote 
better farming methods. In the fall of 1917, 
George Fever, J.A. Poytress, Sam Heisinger, 
H.W. Wrightson and Charles Parlier were 
among a group of farmers that met with Leroy 
Smith, the first Extension Service farm advisor 
assigned to Fresno County, to lay the ground-
work for a Fresno County Farm Bureau orga-
nization. 
Fresno County Farm Bureau, like many 
other County Farm Bureau organizations, was 
originally set up in joint offices within the Uni-
versity of California Agriculture Extension 
Service. The Farm Bureau membership rose 
and fell in the pre-World War II days, dropping 
to 350 during the Depression. The largest 
growth in membership occurred around the 
Farm Bureau’s 50th anniversary, between 
1945 and 1967 when it rose from 1,000 to 
4,500 members. Today, the Fresno County 
Farm Bureau represents more than 4,000 
members. In the early 1960s, Fresno County 
took first place in total production value of ag-
riculture commodities. Fresno County remains 
the number one agricultural county in the 
country, bringing in $5.94 billion in 2010. 
The Farm Bureau has played an integral 
role in many projects throughout its history, in-
cluding: presenting President Franklin D. Roo-
sevelt a program to strengthen agriculture dur-
ing the Great Depression years in 1931; 
partnering with the Madera, Tulare and Kings 
County Farm Bureaus to organize the Cali-
fornia Farm Bureau Marketing Association in 
1918; starting a pilot program to sell tree-rip-
ened fruit to southern California consumers in 
1966; and playing a major role in the develop-
ment and implementation of the Immigration 
Reform and Control Act (IRCA) of 1986. 
Today, the Farm Bureau is a grassroots, na-
tionwide network of Farm Bureaus organized 
on county, state and national levels. The 
county Farm Bureau is the center of the orga-
nization and is one of 53 county Farm Bu-
reaus currently representing a combined mem-
bership of over 4,000 family members in Fres-
no County. Collectively, Farm Bureau is Cali-
fornia’s largest farm organization with mem-
berships from 76,500 farm families in 56 coun-
ties. 
The Farm Bureau continues to lead the agri-
culture industry and the community in ad-
dressing issues that result in long-term viability 
for agriculture and promoting the economic vi-
tality of the region. Farm Bureau spends 
countless hours researching agriculturally-re-
lated legislation; testifying in front of local, 
state and federal government; and conducting 
meetings with elected officials. In addition, it 
fields hundreds of calls, providing education 
and outreach to the community, which has 
continued to be a centerpiece of the Farm Bu-
reau. Through Coffee Talk meetings, which

Mr. KUCINICH. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
honor Joseph’s Home, a safe, supportive envi-
ronment for homeless individuals transitioning 
from local hospitals and other social service 
agencies following a period of illness or sur-
gery. 
Cleveland has had a long history of organi-
zations stepping up and caring for the less for-
tunate. The Sisters of Charity of St. Augustine 
(CSA) arrived in Cleveland, Ohio from France 
in 1851 to serve as the city’s first public health 
nurses, laying the foundation for what would 
become Joseph’s House. The CSA quickly 
began providing the health and educational 
needs of Cleveland’s most impoverished and 
vulnerable residents. Over the past 160 years, 
the CSA has remained dedicated to address-
ing the root causes of poverty and meeting the 
needs of the communities they serve. 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 28, 2012 
Mr. TOWNS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
honor and pay tribute to Bishop Albert L. 
Jamison, Sr. 
Bishop Albert L. Jamison, Sr. is a native of 
Brooklyn, New York. He serves as the distin-
guished Pastor of Pleasant Grove Baptist Tab-
ernacle where he holds the unique honor of 
pastoring in the church of which he was born 
and raised. He has taken his congregation to 
a new awareness of God. 
He is a nationally known evangelist, who 
travels across the United States to some of 
the largest cities and churches preaching the 
Gospel. He is the president and founder of 
‘‘Pentecost At Any Cost’’ ministry. As a dedi-
cated pastor and leader in the ministerial field, 
Bishop Jamison exemplifies a powerful Gospel 
music ministry. In 1970, Bishop Jamison 
began working with the late Reverend James 
Cleveland and continued working with him 
until the Lord called Rev. Cleveland home. 
While serving on the Board of Directors, 
Bishop Jamison was voted ‘‘Chairman’’ of the 
Board of Directors, March 1996. He has taken 
the world’s largest Gospel music organization, 
The Gospel Music Workshop of America, to 
new heights. 
He is the loving husband of Lady Dianette 
Jamison and the proud father of Jourdan Allen 
and Joshua Jermelle Jamison. His eldest son, 
Albert J. Jamison preceded him in death in 
January 2001. 
Because he dares to believe God, his life 
serves as an example to those he leads to de-
velop a personal relationship with the Lord, to 
study the Word of God and to face the chal-
lenges of life depending whole-heartedly in 
faith on the Lord. This way of life is expressed 
in one of his favorite scriptures found in II Co-
rinthians 15:58—Therefore, my beloved breth-
ren, be ye steadfast, unmovable, always 
abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch 
as ye know that your labor is not in vain in the 
Lord. 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize 
Bishop Albert L. Jamison, Sr. for his extraor-
dinary contributions to the Brooklyn commu-
nity.

IN SUPPORT OF THE SUPREME 
COURT 
DECISION 
UPHOLDING 
THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT 
A group of CSA Sisters, led by founding 
Sisters Joan Gallagher and Regina Fierman, 
noticed that Greater Cleveland’s homeless 
community transitioning from local hospitals 
and other social service agencies following a 
period of illness or surgery did not have ac-
cess to a safe and supportive environment. 
With a legacy of responding to the unmet 
needs of the community’s most vulnerable 
residents, the Sisters of Charity of St. Augus-
tine opened the doors of Joseph’s Home in 
June 2000. 
HON. LAURA RICHARDSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
Joseph’s House has helped over 400 men 
transition back into the world and has provided 
them with a second chance in life. Each year, 
around 50 men are helped; the house has a 
capacity of 11 men at any given time. The 
people served by Joseph’s House, leave it 
with the confidence and support that helps 
them succeed. Joseph’s House provides its 
residents with job opportunities, educational 
advancement and more importantly, a place to 
call home. 
Mr. Speaker and colleagues, please join me 
in honoring Joseph’s House for its years of 
service and dedication to improving the lives 
of the less fortunate.

Ms. RICHARDSON. Mr. Speaker, after two 
years battling in the courts I am proud to an-
nounce today that the Supreme Court has 
upheld the Affordable Care Act. This has been 
a long and difficult fight, but I can say without 
a doubt it has been worth it. 
This landmark ruling will allow millions of 
Americans to rest easy, knowing that they will 
not be driven into debt from medical bills if 
they get sick. Children will no longer be de-

Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, it is 
my great honor to extend a heartfelt congratu-
lations to the volunteers, employees and rep-
resentatives of United Way as they celebrate 
125 years of motivating millions of people to 
advance the common good. 
On June 21, 2012, the worldwide network 
celebrated their United Way Day of Action, a 
day dedicated to volunteer and community 
service activities and encouraging others to 
pledge to become readers, tutors, or mentors. 
Also, on June 28, 2012, they will be cele-
brating the official United Way Founders Day, 
commemorating community leaders Frances 
Wisebart Jacobs, the Rev. Myron W. Reed, 
Msgr. William J. O’Ryan, Dean H. Martyn Hart 
and Rabbi William S. Friedman for founding 
the Charity Organizations Society, the first 
‘‘United Way’’ Organization in Denver, Colo-
rado in 1887. 
In 125 years, United Way has expanded be-
yond Denver and Colorado and beyond the 
United States to become a network of almost 
1,800 community-based United Ways in 45 
countries and territories around the world. In 
as many years, United Way has become one 
of the biggest and most influential charity or-
ganizations in the world. To emphasize this 
point, United Way, in a partnership with the 
National Football League (NFL), raised more 
than $1 billion dollars in 1974—the first time in 
history that an annual campaign of a single or-
ganization had raised this much money. 
United Way envisions ‘‘a world where all in-
dividuals and families achieve their human po-
tential through education, income stability and 
healthy lives.’’ For this reason, in 2008, they 
set forth a 10-year program to achieve three 
goals by 2018: (1) Improve education and cut 
the number of high school dropouts (1.2 mil-
lion students every year) in half; (2) help peo-
ple achieve financial stability and get at least 
half of lower-income families (1.9 million fami-
lies) on the way to economic independence; 
(3) promote healthy lives and increase by one- 
third the number of youth and adults who are 
healthy and avoid risky behaviors. These are 
ambitious goals but I am confident that the 
thousands of United Way advocates will work 
tirelessly to achieve them. 
I would like to especially recognize the local 
United Way organizations in Georgia’s Second 
Congressional 
District:

A TRIBUTE TO DR. SWAMY

HON. EDOLPHUS TOWNS 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 28, 2012 
pre-existing conditions, and millions of young 
Americans will be able to stay on their par-
ent’s healthcare plans until they are 26. 
The function of government is to make life 
better for all Americans, regardless of socio-
economic background. The Affordable Care 
Act will improve the quality of life for working 
families, children and seniors. It will also 
strengthen our economy. 
President Obama is to be congratulated for 
his indispensable leadership in achieving the 
goal of affordable quality healthcare for all 
Americans, a goal we Democrats have been 
fighting for more than 75 years. 
It is a fact of life that individuals do not have 
a choice in participating in the health care 
market. Eventually we will all get sick, and 
need medical attention. This bill requires every 
American to take control of their own cov-
erage, and be responsible for themselves. 
I am proud to have voted in favor of this 
legislation two years ago, and prouder still to 
have stood on the steps of the Supreme Court 
today to celebrate the success of having the 
Affordable Care Act upheld. Today’s ruling is 
a momentous occasion and a true victory for 
Americans across the nation.

REGARDING H. RES. 711 
they refused all Democratic requests for wit-
nesses and hearings. The investigation was 
closed to the public. 
The Republican refusal to even allow those 
directly involved with the Fast & Furious pro-
gram to testify before the Oversight Com-
mittee portrays their political motivations, not 
the facts, nor the thousands of innocent civil-
ians in Mexico and on the border who have 
lost their lives from heavily-armed drug cartels. 
Attorney General Holder testified before the 
Committee nine times. The Department of 
Justice provided over 700 thousand docu-
ments to the House Oversight & Investigations 
Committee. Despite this broad cooperation, 
my Republican colleagues kept moving the 
goal posts, making it impossible to meet their 
demands. There was no end in sight. Presi-
dent Obama’s decision to assert executive 
privilege was a well-reasoned decision to stop 
playing the Republicans political game. 
I believe deeply in the fundamental respon-
sibility of Congress to provide oversight and 
accountability for the executive branch. We 
only weaken that authority by engaging in this 
partisan stunt Congress and the American 
people deserve better. We should reject this 
effort and do our job to find out what really 
happened.

HON. EARL BLUMENAUER 
IN MEMORY OF BISHOP ROBERT C. 
JEFFERSON 
HON. AL GREEN 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 28, 2012 
Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to honor the memory of a pillar in 
the Sunnyside community in Houston, Texas, 
Bishop Robert C. Jefferson, Pastor of the 
Cullen Missionary Baptist Church. With excep-
tional dedication, Bishop Jefferson served his 
community and advocated for the betterment 
of society. 
Bishop Jefferson was born in Baton Rouge, 
Louisiana on January 12, 1942. He accepted 
his calling into the gospel ministry in March 
1976 and was ordained at Mount Horeb Bap-
tist Church in Houston under the pastoral 
leadership of the late Reverend Johnnie 
Jones. In March 1977, he founded Cullen Mis-
sionary Baptist Church and faithfully served 
there for the rest of his life. 
A champion of the downtrodden and under-
served, Bishop Jefferson founded and was ac-
tive on a host of community organizations. He 
was a Founding Member of Ministers Against 
Crime, an organization that is active in issues 
involving inequities and civil rights in the 
Greater Houston Area. He was also the 
Founder of Sunnyside Up, Inc., a community 
development project; Founder/President of A 
Brand New City, Inc; Founder/President of the 
Cullen Christian Child Development Center; 
the former Second Vice President and Director 
of Religious Affairs of the NAACP Houston 
Branch; and a former member of the Houston 
Independent School District Board. 
Finally, Mr. Speaker, Bishop Jefferson will 
be dearly missed by his wife, Myrtle, grand-
OF OREGON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 28, 2012 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, today, I 
voted against the House Privileged Resolution 
holding Attorney General Eric Holder in con-
tempt of Congress. Never in the 225 years of 
the House has there been a vote to hold any 
Cabinet member in contempt, and I will never 
vote to support such partisan legislation that’s 
nothing short of a race to the bottom for this 
House. 
There are serious questions that remain to 
be answered about the Alcohol, Tobacco, 
Firearms and Explosives (ATF) program, infa-
mously know as ‘‘Fast and Furious,’’ started in 
2005 under the Bush administration. The De-
partment of Justice is in the midst of such an 
investigation, but today’s vote will do nothing 
to further that inquiry, and will instead slow 
and muddle the process. 
The charges by Chairman ISSA of a con-
spiratorial effort by the Obama administration 
to strengthen gun control laws—are com-
pletely unsubstantiated and laughable on their 
face. When that became apparent, the Chair-
man turned to blatant political tactics, culmi-
nating in a Contempt of Congress resolution 
that was rushed to the floor. 
The Republicans and the National Rifle As-
sociation have created a web of constraints 
that make it almost impossible to restrict these 
dangerous practices that prompted the pro-
gram in the first place. 
Fast and Furious was a flawed operation. 
Those flaws, however, parallel the biased, po-
liticized investigation run by House Oversight 
& Investigations Committee Republicans. Dur-
ing the Committee’s 16–month investigation, 
Mr. TOWNS. Mr. Speaker, Dr. Swamy 
Sunkara was born in India. He graduated from 
Andhra Medical College and King George 
Hospital. Named after Dr. Swamy Naidu, Dr. 
Sunkara was a great surgeon, philanthropist, 
athlete, swordsman, and horseman of national 
level. He is also from a family of physicians 
and soccer players of international reputation. 
As a young student leader Dr. Sunkara vol-
unteered in various natural disasters including 
one in Divi Andhra predesh, where he worked 
for several weeks directly under Mother The-
resa. She always had kind words about him 
when she visited that area. 
Dr. Sunkara served as surgeon, and then 
trained as an anesthesiologist in Jamaica, 
Trinidad and Tobago. He completed the post-
graduate course of diploma in anesthesiology 
from University of West Indies. He served as 
a social worker at St. James Infirmary in Mon-
tego Bay, Jamaica from 1979 to 1981 and 
served at the Prince Elizabeth Hospital for 
destitute children in Port of Spain, Trinidad 
from 1981 to 1987. He gave free anesthesia 
for surgeries of children with cleft palates, 
club-foot, and other congenital abnormalities. 
Dr. Sunkara worked as a volunteer physician 
at Trinidad and Tobago Sports Medicine and 
received letters of commendation in Jamaica, 
Trinidad and Tobago for his work and dedica-
tion. 
Dr. Sunkara migrated to the United States in 
1988. He successfully completed the Diploma 
in Tropical Medicine and Health, Masters in 
Public Health with double majors in Inter-
national Health and Emergency Medicine. He 
served as a published researcher and volun-
teer in Children’s Cancer Study Group at New 
York Medical College, and Westchester Med-
ical Center in Valhalla, New York. He worked 
as a volunteer Emergency Medical Technician 
at both the Ossining Volunteer Ambulance 
corps and Pleasantville Volunteer Ambulance 
Corps. Dr. Sunkara received the Best Volun-
teer award from Westchester County Execu-
tive for the year ’88–89 and received Best Vol-
unteer award from the University of Medicine 
and Dentistry of Newark New Jersey in 1989. 
Dr. Sunkara also served as one of the Uncles 
for foster children of Richard Allen Center on 
Life in New York City. 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize Dr. 
Swamy Naidu Sunkara for his extraordinary 
contributions to New York City’s medical com-
munity.
