An air quality permit, with conditions, is hereby granted to BMP Investments Incorporated (BMP), 
pursuant to Sections 75-2-204 and 211 of the Montana Code Annotated (MCA), as amended, and 
Administrative Rules of Montana (ARM) 17.8.740, et seq., as amended, for the following: 
 
SECTION I: 
Permitted Facilities 
 
A. Plant Location 
 
BMP is located in the Bull Mountains approximately 16 miles southeast of Roundup, 
Montana, and approximately 35 miles northeast of Billings, Montana.  The legal 
description of the site is Section 12, West ½ Section 13, and Section 14, Township 6 North, 
Range 26 East, in Musselshell County, Montana. 
 
B. Current Permit Action 
 
On November 21, 2006, the Department of Environmental Quality (Department) received a 
request from BMP for a modification to Permit #3179-01 to add, during the development 
phase of the mining operation, a run-of-mine (ROM) coal stockpile, a topsoil stockpile, 
additional haul roads, and associated transfers involved with the coal stockpile and topsoil 
stockpile.  The request will allow BMP to transfer coal from the mine portal to a ROM coal 
stockpile using haul trucks, a wheeled loader, and a bulldozer.  Coal will be dumped to the 
ground from the mine portal.  A wheeled loader will load the haul trucks for transport to the 
ROM coal stockpile.  The haul trucks will dump the coal to the ground and a bulldozer will 
move the coal to the desired location within the pile.  Prior to stockpiling the coal, a 
bulldozer will prepare the coal stockpile site by removing the topsoil (about 12 inches of 
soil depth) and move the soil into a pile for storage.   
 
BMP proposed the following equipment and emission sources as listed below: 
 
• 
ROM coal stockpile (surface area: 520,000 square feet, (ft2)) 
• 
ROM coal stockpile site preparation (topsoil removal – dozer) 
• 
Topsoil storage pile (surface area: 100,000 ft2) 
• 
Mobile sources (haul trucks, wheeled loader, and bulldozer) 
 
BMP will add to the ROM coal stockpile until the primary phase of the mining operation 
begins.  After the primary phase of the mining operation has begun, BMP will transfer the 
coal from the coal stockpile to the new coal preparation plant.  BMP is not requesting an 
increase in the production rate of the development phase.  Once the primary phase has 
begun, the haul trucks, wheeled loader, and the requested haul road operations will not be 
needed.

preparation plant, a new coal preparation plant, a rail loadout, a waste disposal area 
(WDA), mine ventilation, mine yard area equipment, a quarry, a run-of-mine (ROM) coal 
stockpile, a topsoil storage pile, and various conveyors and transfer stations.

Source Description 
 
BMP operates an underground coal mine that is initially capable of producing up to 1.3 
million tons of raw coal per year.  The initial phase of this project covers the 
development stage of the operation.  The initial development phase allows for some 
production while the ultimate primary facilities are constructed.  The primary facilities 
(new coal wash plant and on-site rail loadout) will support a production rate of up to 4.0 
million tons of raw coal per year.   
 
The operations at the facility can be classified into four categories: underground mining, 
coal handling and storage, coal cleaning, and waste disposal.  Coal will be mined 
underground using continuous miner sections and longwall panels.  The continuous miner 
will be used to establish a mineable block of coal, and the longwall equipment will be 
used to extract the block of coal.  A conveyor belt will be used to transfer the ROM coal 
to a stockpile outside of the mine portal. 
 
Surface material storage facilities will include stockpiles of ROM coal, clean coal, and 
reject material from the wash plant.  Material will be moved from inside the mine to the 
ROM stockpile on a high capacity belt conveyor.  Other conveyors will be used to 
transport coal from the ROM pile to the coal cleaning facility and from there to the clean 
coal piles.  Coal will be supplied to local consumers from bins with hoppers located at the 
wash plant facilities.  Reject material will be sent to the WDA. 
 
During the development operations, the coal will be transferred from the ROM stockpile 
to the existing wash plant via a belt conveyor.  The coal will pass through the buffer bin 
to a crusher and sizing screen and then on to the heavy media washer.  The final product 
will be passed through a fluidized bed to air dry the product.  A primary coal washing 
facility will be constructed concurrently with the development operations. 
 
The development phase wash plant will reject 19 percent of the raw coal stream and the 
new primary facility will reject 13 percent of the raw coal stream.  These coal processing 
wastes and other mine development wastes will be permanently disposed of in the WDA 
located 1.4 miles northeast of the wash plant.  The mine plan calls for revegetation of this 
area after completion of the project and after the appropriate seed bed preparation.

Permit History 
 
Permit #3179-00 was issued to BMP on May 10, 2002, for the project as described 
above located in Sections 12, 13, and 14, Township 6 North, Range 26 East, in 
Musselshell County, Montana. 
 
On May 9, 2003, BMP submitted a request to delay the commencement of ambient air 
monitoring until the mine reaches a coal production level of 1.3 million tons during any 
rolling 12-month period.  The permit action was an administrative amendment to make 
that change and to update the rule citations in the permit.  Permit #3179-01 replaced 
Permit #3179-00. 
 
D. 
Current Permit Action 
 
On November 21, 2006, the Department of Environmental Quality (Department) received 
a request from BMP for a modification to Permit #3179-01 to add, during the 
development phase of the mining operation, a ROM coal stockpile, a topsoil stockpile, 
additional haul roads, and associated transfers involved with the coal stockpile and 
topsoil stockpile.  The request will allow BMP to transfer coal from the mine portal to a 
ROM coal stockpile using haul trucks, a wheeled loader, and a bulldozer.  Coal will be 
dumped to the ground from the mine portal.  A wheeled loader will load the haul trucks 
for transport to the ROM coal stockpile.  The haul trucks will dump the coal to the 
ground and a bulldozer will move the coal to the desired location within the pile.  Prior to 
stockpiling the coal, a bulldozer will prepare the coal stockpile site by removing the 
topsoil (about 12 inches of soil depth) and move the soil into a pile for storage.   
 
BMP proposed the following equipment and emission sources as listed below: 
 
• 
ROM coal stockpile (surface area: 520,000 square feet, (ft2)) 
• 
ROM coal stockpile site preparation (topsoil removal – dozer) 
• 
Topsoil storage pile (surface area: 100,000 ft2) 
• 
Mobile sources (haul trucks, wheeled loader, and bulldozer) 
 
BMP will add to the ROM coal stockpile until the primary phase of the mining operation 
begins.  After the primary phase of the mining operation has begun, BMP will transfer 
the coal from the coal stockpile to the new coal preparation plant.  BMP is not requesting 
an increase in the production rate of the development phase.  Once the primary phase has 
begun, the haul trucks, wheeled loader, and the requested haul road operations will not be 
needed.   Permit #3179-02 replaces Permit #3179-01.

C. 
ARM 17.8, Subchapter 3 – Emission Standards, including, but not limited to: 
 
1. ARM 17.8.304 Visible Air Contaminants.  This rule requires that no person may 
cause or authorize emissions to be discharged into the outdoor atmosphere from any 
source installed after November 23, 1968, that exhibit an opacity of 20% or greater 
averaged over six consecutive minutes. 
 
2. ARM 17.8.308 Particulate Matter, Airborne.  (1) This rule requires an opacity 
limitation of 20% for all fugitive emission sources and that reasonable precautions be 
taken to control emissions of airborne Particulate Matter (PM).  (2) Under this rule, 
BMP shall not cause or authorize the use of any street, road or parking lot without 
taking reasonable precautions to control emissions of airborne particulate matter. 
 
3. ARM 17.8.309 Particulate Matter, Fuel Burning Equipment.  This rule requires that 
no person shall cause, allow or permit to be discharged into the atmosphere 
particulate matter caused by the combustion of fuel in excess of the amount 
determined by this rule. 
 
4. ARM 17.8.310 Particulate Matter, Industrial Process.  This rule requires that no 
person shall cause, allow or permit to be discharged into the atmosphere particulate 
matter in excess of the amount set forth in this rule. 
 
5. ARM 17.8.322 Sulfur Oxide Emissions--Sulfur in Fuel.  This rule requires that no 
person shall burn liquid, solid or gaseous fuel in excess of the amount set forth in this 
rule. 
 
6. ARM 17.8.340 Standard of Performance for New Stationary Sources and Emission 
Guidelines for Existing Sources.  This rule incorporates, by reference, 40 CFR 60, 
Standards of Performance for New Stationary Sources (NSPS).  BMP is considered 
an NSPS affected facility under 40 CFR 60 and is subject to the requirements of 40 
CFR 60, Subpart Y, Standard of Performance for Coal Preparation Plants. 
 
Subpart Y - Coal Preparation Plants - requires a particulate emission limitation of 
0.04 grams per dry standard cubic meter, a 10 percent opacity limitation on 
pneumatic coal cleaning emissions, and an opacity limitation of 20 percent for coal 
processing, conveying, storage, and loading systems as described in Section II of the 
permit.  The subpart also requires particulate and opacity limitations for thermal 
dryers.  The coal dryer proposed for the development phase of the operation uses 
ambient air as opposed to a heated gas stream; therefore, that portion of the 
regulation is not applicable.  If at some point, the permittee proposes to use a heated 
gas stream for coal drying, the Department must be notified in order to determine the 
monitoring and testing requirements with respect to NSPS applicability.  The NSPS 
applicability for pneumatic coal cleaning and thermal dryers is specific to bituminous 
coal, while the other provisions apply to all classifications of coal.  The applicant 
reported that the coal to be mined is classified as bituminous. 
 
D. 
ARM 17.8, Subchapter 5 – Air Quality Permit Application, Operation and Open Burning 
Fees, including, but not limited to: 
 
1. ARM 17.8.504 Air Quality Permit Application Fees.  This section requires that an 
applicant submit an air quality permit application fee concurrent with the submittal of 
an air quality permit application.  A permit application is incomplete until the proper 
application fee is paid to the Department.  BMP submitted the appropriate permit 
application fee for the current permit action.

2. ARM 17.8.505 When Permit Required--Exclusions.  An annual air quality operation 
fee must, as a condition of continued operation, be submitted to the Department by 
each source of air contaminants holding an air quality permit (excluding an open 
burning permit) issued by the Department.  The air quality operation fee is based on 
the actual or estimated actual amount of air pollutants emitted during the previous 
calendar year. 
 
 
An air quality operation fee is separate and distinct from an air quality permit 
application fee.  The annual assessment and collection of the air quality operation fee, 
described above, shall take place on a calendar-year basis.  The Department may 
insert into any final permit issued after the effective date of these rules, such 
conditions as may be necessary to require the payment of an air quality operation fee 
on a calendar-year basis, including provisions that prorate the required fee amount. 
 
E. 
ARM 17.8, Subchapter 7 – Permit, Construction and Operation of Air Contaminant 
Sources, including, but not limited to: 
 
1. ARM 17.8.740 Definitions.  This rule is a list of applicable definitions used in this 
chapter, unless indicated otherwise in a specific subchapter. 
 
2. ARM 17.8.743 Montana Air Quality Permits--When Required.  This rule requires a 
facility to obtain an air quality permit or permit alteration if they construct, alter or 
use any air contaminant sources that have the Potential to Emit (PTE) greater than 25 
tons per year of any pollutant.  BMP has the PTE more than 25 tons per year of 
particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of 10 microns or less (PM10); 
therefore, an air quality permit is required. 
 
3. ARM 17.8.744 Montana Air Quality Permits--General Exclusions.  This rule 
identifies the activities that are not subject to the Montana Air Quality Permit 
program. 
 
4. ARM 17.8.745 Montana Air Quality Permits—Exclusion for De Minimis Changes.  
This rule identifies the de minimis changes at permitted facilities that are not subject 
to the Montana Air Quality Permit Program.   
 
5. ARM 17.8.748 New or Modified Emitting Units--Permit Application Requirements.   
(1) This rule requires that a permit application be submitted prior to installation, 
modification, or use of a source.  BMP submitted the required permit application for 
the current permit action.  (7) This rule requires that the applicant notify the public by 
means of legal publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the area affected 
by the application for a permit.  BMP submitted an affidavit of publication of public 
notice for the November 19, 2006, issue of The Billings Gazette, a newspaper of 
general circulation in the city of Billings in Yellowstone County, as proof of 
compliance with the public notice requirements. 
 
6. ARM 17.8.749 Conditions for Issuance or Denial of Permit.  This rule requires that 
the permits issued by the Department must authorize the construction and operation 
of the facility or emitting unit subject to the conditions in the permit and the 
requirements of this subchapter.  This rule also requires that the permit must contain 
any conditions necessary to assure compliance with the Federal Clean Air Act 
(FCAA), the Clean Air Act of Montana, and rules adopted under those acts.

7. ARM 17.8.752 Emission Control Requirements.  This rule requires a source to install 
the maximum air pollution control capability that is technically practicable and 
economically feasible, except that BACT shall be utilized.  A BACT review was 
required for the current permit action.  The BACT analysis is discussed in Section III 
of this Permit Analysis. 
 
8. ARM 17.8.755 Inspection of Permit.  This rule requires that air quality permits shall 
be made available for inspection by the Department at the location of the source. 
 
9. ARM 17.8.756 Compliance with Other Requirements.  This rule states that nothing in 
the permit shall be construed as relieving BMP of the responsibility for complying 
with any applicable federal or Montana statute, rule, or standard, except as 
specifically provided in ARM 17.8.740, et seq. 
 
10. ARM 17.8.759 Review of Applications.  This rule describes the Department’s 
responsibilities for processing permit applications and making permit decisions on 
those permit applications that do not require the preparation of an environmental 
impact statement.  
 
11. ARM 17.8.762 Duration of Permit.  An air quality permit shall be valid until revoked 
or modified, as provided in this subchapter, except that a permit issued prior to 
construction of a new or altered source may contain a condition providing that the 
permit will expire unless construction is commenced within the time specified in the 
permit, which in no event may be less than 1 year after the permit is issued. 
 
12. ARM 17.8.763 Revocation of Permit.  An air quality permit may be revoked upon 
written request of the permittee, or for violations of any requirement of the Clean Air 
Act of Montana, rules adopted under the Clean Air Act of Montana, the FCAA, rules 
adopted under the FCAA, or any applicable requirement contained in the Montana 
State Implementation Plan (SIP). 
  
13. ARM 17.8.764 Administrative Amendment to Permit.  An air quality permit may be 
amended for changes in any applicable rules and standards adopted by the Board of 
Environmental Review (Board) or changed conditions of operation at a source or 
stack that do not result in an increase of emissions as a result of those changed 
conditions.  The owner or operator of a facility may not increase the facility’s 
emissions beyond permit limits unless the increase meets the criteria in ARM 
17.8.745 for a de minimis change not requiring a permit, or unless the owner or 
operator applies for and receives another permit in accordance with ARM 17.8.748, 
ARM 17.8.749, ARM 17.8.752, ARM 17.8.755, and ARM 17.8.756, and with all 
applicable requirements in ARM Title 17, Chapter 8, subchapters 8, 9, and 10. 
 
14. ARM 17.8.765 Transfer of Permit.  This rule states that an air quality permit may be 
transferred from one person to another if written notice of Intent to Transfer, 
including the names of the transferor and the transferee, is sent to the Department. 
 
F. 
ARM 17.8, Subchapter 8 – Prevention of Significant Deterioration of Air Quality, 
including, but not limited to: 
 
1. ARM 17.8.801 Definitions.  This rule is a list of applicable definitions used in this 
subchapter.

                                                                                       Final: 03/13/07 
2. ARM 17.8.818 Review of Major Stationary Sources and Major Modifications--
Source Applicability and Exemptions.  The requirements contained in ARM 17.8.819 
through 17.8.827 shall apply to any major stationary source and any major 
modification, with respect to each pollutant subject to regulation under the Federal 
Clean Air Act (FCAA) that it would emit, except as this subchapter would otherwise 
allow. 
 
This facility is not a major stationary source since this facility is not a listed source and 
the facility's PTE is below 250 tons per year of any pollutant (excluding fugitive 
emissions). 
 
As part of previous permit application processes, the Department required BMP to 
provide information regarding the ownership relationship between the BMP Bull 
Mountain Mine #1 Project and the proposed Roundup Power Project.   
 
BMP indicated that BMP is the lessee under a coal lease comprising the coal to be mined 
at the Bull Mountain Mine #1 coal mine.  In addition, BMP has applied for the permit to 
mine the coal at the mine. 
 
BMP further indicated that the Roundup Power Project will ultimately be owned by 
private, municipal, and cooperative utilities, and possibly industrial companies.  None of 
these equity owners of the Roundup Power Project have any interest or ownership in 
BMP nor will they in the future.  Currently Bull Mountain Development Company, No. 
1, L.L.C., is engaged in the development of the Roundup Power Project.  While Bull 
Mountain Development Company, No. 1, L.L.C., is currently involved in the 
development of the Roundup Power Project, it intends to transfer all rights it has in the 
project to the ultimate owners of the Roundup Power Project once those owners have 
been selected and have entered into appropriate contracts among themselves.  BMP 
currently has no interest or ownership in the Roundup Power Project and it is not 
anticipated that BMP will, at any time, have any ownership interests or right to control 
the ultimate entity that will complete development of the Roundup Power Project and 
thereafter operate such project. 
 
BMP does have a contractual agreement with Bull Mountain Development Company, 
No. 1, L.L.C., to supply coal and for ultimate ash disposal for the Roundup plant.  This 
contract will be transferred from Bull Mountain Development Company, No. 1, L.L.C., 
to the plant owners upon completion of the owner’s agreements. 
 
Therefore, for the purpose of air permitting, the Department currently considers the Bull 
Mountain Mine #1 and the Roundup Power Project to be separate and distinct stationary 
sources as defined under New Source Review.    
 
G. 
ARM 17.8, Subchapter 12 – Operating Permit Program Applicability, including, but not 
limited to: 
 
1. ARM 17.8.1201 Definitions.  (23) Major Source under Section 7412 of the FCAA is 
defined as any source having: 
 
a. PTE > 100 tons/year of any pollutant; 
 
b. PTE > 10 tons/year of any one Hazardous Air Pollutant (HAP), PTE > 25 
tons/year of a combination of all HAPs, or lesser quantity as the Department may 
establish by rule; or 
 
c. PTE > 70 tons/year of PM10 in a serious PM10 nonattainment area.

                                                                                       Final: 03/13/07 
2. ARM 17.8.1204 Air Quality Operating Permit Program.  (1) Title V of the FCAA 
amendments of 1990 requires that all sources, as defined in ARM 17.8.1204(1), 
obtain a Title V Operating Permit.  In reviewing and issuing Air Quality Permit 
#3179-02 for BMP, the following conclusions were made: 
 
a. The facility’s PTE is less than 100 tons/year for any pollutant (excluding 
fugitive emissions). 
 
b. The facility’s PTE is less than 10 tons/year for any one HAP and less than 25 
tons/year of all HAPs. 
 
c. This source is not located in a serious PM10 nonattainment area. 
 
d. This facility is subject to 40 CFR 60, Subpart Y. 
 
e. This facility is not subject to any current NESHAP standards. 
 
f. This source is not a Title IV affected source, nor a solid waste combustion unit. 
 
g. This source is not an EPA designated Title V source. 
 
Based on these facts, the Department determined that BMP will be a minor source of 
emissions as defined under Title V and BMP is not required to obtain a Title V 
Operating Permit.  However, if minor sources subject to NSPS are required to obtain 
a Title V Operating Permit in the future, BMP will be required to obtain a Title V 
Operating Permit. 
 
III. 
BACT Determination 
 
A BACT determination is required for each new or altered source.  BMP shall install on the new 
or altered source the maximum air pollution control capability, which is technically practicable 
and economically feasible, except that BACT shall be utilized.  The current permit action 
modifies Permit #3179-01 by allowing a ROM coal stockpile to operate during the development 
phase of the mining operation and also adds an emission source to the facility (topsoil storage 
pile); therefore, a BACT analysis was required for the current permit action. 
 
The Department determined that BACT for the ROM coal stockpile, a topsoil storage pile, 
transfer points, coal handling, topsoil handling, and vehicle traffic on unpaved roads is the 
continuation of emission control techniques currently used at the mine.  This includes chemical 
stabilization and watering on haul roads and good engineering practices such as minimizing fall 
distances on material handling operations as necessary to maintain compliance with the opacity 
and reasonable precautions limitations. 
 
The following pollutants will be emitted as a result of the project: 
 
Pollutant 
 
 
 
Source
 
Particulates (PM/PM10): Fugitive emissions from mining activities, conveying, handling, and 
loadout of coal; handling, conveying, and disposal of reject/waste 
material; handling of topsoil and topsoil storage pile; and travel on 
unpaved roads.

                                                                                       Final: 03/13/07 
PM/PM10 BACT Analysis
 
Units with applicable emissions for this BACT analysis include fugitive emissions of particulates 
from a ROM coal stockpile, a topsoil storage pile, transfer points, coal handling, topsoil handling, 
and vehicle traffic on unpaved roads. 
 
Fugitive PM/PM10 Emissions 
 
In general, fugitive emissions from open sources are controlled by preventative and/or mitigating 
measures/techniques.  The sources of fugitive particulates may be classified according to the 
activities, which generate the emissions.  The activity classes for the proposed project include: 1) 
wind erosion of coal stockpile, 2) coal handling and transfer, 3) wind erosion of topsoil storage 
pile, 4) topsoil handling, and 5) travel on unpaved roads. 
 
Wind erosion affects both the storage piles and outdoor material handling/disposal activities.  
Preventative techniques reduce emissions by reducing the extent of the source, by modifying the 
process, or by adjusting work practices.  Reduction of emissions of fugitive dust or particulate 
matter from wind erosion and material handling can be accomplished by enclosure, chemical 
stabilization, or material wetting.  Chemical stabilization will not be considered because it has 
been deemed technically unfeasible for the proposed project due to the constant activity on the 
storage piles and because the chemicals used could become air pollutants as the coal is burned.    
 
A significant concern with this operation is the potential for wind erosion from the ROM and 
clean coal stockpiles.  Enclosure of the stockpiles (in barns or silos) was considered through the 
BACT analysis but was not determined to be technically feasible due to the constant material 
movement at the source and this type of control has not been required for recently permitted 
similar sources of particulate emissions.  The Department will require that BMP apply surface 
moisture to the product either during mining activities, washing, or loadout operations and utilize 
contouring techniques to reduce potential for wind erosion.  
 
The Department determined that the use of reasonable precautions, contouring, and watering, as 
necessary, to maintain compliance with the 20% opacity limitation will constitute BACT for the 
coal stockpiles.  
 
The Department determined that the use of reasonable precautions, contouring, watering and/or 
chemical dust suppressant, compaction techniques, and re-vegetation, as necessary, to maintain 
compliance with the 20% opacity limitation will constitute BACT for the topsoil storage pile. 
 
Material handling for the purposes of this BACT analysis is broken down into two categories, 
coal product and topsoil product.  Coal handling activities include drops to and from the front-end 
loader, haul trucks, and ground.  Coal handling also includes movement of the pile by a bulldozer. 
Topsoil handling occurs by moving the topsoil into a storage pile by a bulldozer. 
 
The Department determined that BMP shall minimize the fall distance associated with all 
material handling activities to the greatest extent that is practically feasible.  Further, BMP shall 
develop, implement, and maintain good housekeeping practices to keep coal and topsoil transfer 
locations clean.   
 
For particulates generated during loadout operations onto stockpiles, the Department determined 
that the use of fixed stackers with an underground reclaim system at the permanent facility and a 
radial stacker with an adjustable chute at the development facility constitutes BACT.

In addition, BMP shall utilize water and/or chemical dust suppressant, as necessary, for the 
purpose of controlling emissions from the movement of materials by bulldozer or front-end 
loader.  Also, BMP shall use watering and/or chemical dust suppressants, contouring techniques, 
and eventually soil covering and re-vegetation for controlling particulate emissions from the 
topsoil storage pile.   
 
Further, BMP must take reasonable precautions to limit the fugitive emissions of airborne 
particulate matter on haul roads.  BMP shall clean up all spilled material from roadways to further 
limit potential fugitive emissions.  The Department determined that the use water spray and/or 
chemical dust suppressant, as necessary, to maintain compliance with the opacity and reasonable 
precautions limitations will constitute BACT for the haul roads.     
 
In summary, the Department determined that good housekeeping practices, minimization of fall 
distance for material transfer operations, the application of moisture throughout the mining 
process, using stackers with a reclaim system for the primary phase of operations and a radial 
stacker with an adjustable chute for the development phase for pile forming, enclosures for all 
surface conveyors and conveyor transfer points incorporating fabric filter baghouses or pick-up 
points, and water spray and/or chemical dust suppressant, as necessary, to maintain compliance 
with permitted opacity requirements and reasonable precautions limitations constitutes BACT for 
these sources. 
 
IV. 
Emission Inventory 
 
Table 1 lists the estimated PM10 emissions for the primary phase of the project, including 
emission control practices and equipment to be used.  Peak and annual emissions on both an 
uncontrolled and a controlled basis are included.  Peak emission rates are based on peak 
production rates or hours of equipment operation.  Peak coal production through the preparation 
plant has been proposed at 25,000 tons per day.  The annual emission rates are based on average 
production rates and annual operating hours.  The annual coal production rate has been proposed 
at 4 million tons.  The original permit application also contains a complete emission inventory for 
the development phase operations.  Peak and annual coal production rates for the development 
phase have been proposed at 4,000 tons per day and 1.3 million tons per year, respectively.

Existing Air Quality 
 
Baseline air quality (particulate) was monitored in the project area.  The measurements included 
both TSP (total suspended particulate) and PM10. 
 
The period of record submitted with the application is from March 1989 through March 1992.  
All values are well below applicable ambient air quality standards.  The following table 
summarizes the data.  (Values are reported in micrograms per cubic meter.)

Meteorological data was collected at the site as well.  The predominant wind direction is from the 
northwest.  In the immediate plant area the predominant wind is up the P.M. draw.  There is also 
a significant southeasterly component down the draw. 
 
Current local sources of air pollution in the area include vehicle traffic (unpaved roads), the PM 
Mine, agricultural activities, and home heating.  Operational air monitoring requirements for the 
project are contained in Attachment 1. 
 
VI. 
Ambient Air Impact Analysis 
 
Project Summary 
 
The current permit action is to add, during the development phase of the mining operation, a 
ROM coal stockpile, a topsoil stockpile, additional haul roads, and associated transfers involved 
with the coal stockpile and topsoil stockpile. 
 
 
The mine project will include two phases: the development phase and the primary phase.  During 
the development phase of the operation, BMP proposes to initially mine at a rate of 1.3 million 
tons of raw coal per year.  The initial development phase will allow for some production while 
the primary phase facilities are constructed.  These primary facilities include a new coal wash 
plant and an onsite rail loadout, which will support production of up to 4 million tons of coal per 
year.

Review of Modeling Analysis 
 
Air dispersion modeling was not required for the current permitting action.  However, 
GeoResearch Inc. performed an air quality impact analysis for this project for the initial 
application submitted by Meridian Minerals Company on January 16, 1991, and GeoResearch 
performed a second analysis for the Addendum dated February 25, 1992, that was submitted to 
the Department on March 5, 1992.  The analysis used the EPA Industrial Source Complex Model 
(ISCST and ISCLT) to estimate the impacts of the particulates, NOX, SO2, and CO.  The analysis 
included both the development phase and the primary phase, which originally included the ROM 
coal stockpile.  The 1992 results showed that predicted ambient impacts for this facility would not 
cause or contribute to a violation of any state or federal air quality standard.   
 
VII. 
Taking or Damaging Implication Analysis 
 
As required by 2-10-105, MCA, the Department conducted a private property taking and 
damaging assessment and determined there are no taking or damaging implications. 
 
VIII. 
Environmental Assessment 
 
An environmental assessment, required by the Montana Environmental Policy Act, was 
completed for this project.  A copy is attached.

1. 
Legal Description of Site:  BMP is located in the Bull Mountains approximately 16 miles 
southeast of Roundup, Montana, and approximately 35 miles northeast of Billings, Montana.  The 
legal description of the site is Section 12, West ½ Section 13, and Section 14, Township 6 North, 
Range 26 East, in Musselshell County, Montana. 
 
2. 
Description of Project:  BMP submitted a permit application to modify Permit #3179-01 to add, 
during the development phase of the mining operation, a ROM coal stockpile, a topsoil stockpile, 
additional haul roads, and associated transfers involved with the coal stockpile and topsoil 
stockpile. 
 
3. 
Objectives of the Project:  The issuance of Permit #3179-02 would allow BMP to implement the 
above mentioned project during the development phase of the mining operation. 
 
4. 
Alternatives Considered:  In addition to the proposed action, the Department also considered the 
"no-action" alternative.  The "no-action" alternative would deny issuance of the Montana Air 
Quality permit to the facility.  However, the Department does not consider the "no-action" 
alternative to be appropriate because BMP demonstrated compliance with all applicable rules and 
regulations as required for permit issuance.  Therefore, the "no-action" alternative was eliminated 
from further consideration. 
 
5. 
A Listing of Mitigation, Stipulations, and Other Controls:  A listing of the enforceable permit 
conditions and a permit analysis, including a BACT analysis, would be contained in Permit 
#3179-02. 
 
6. 
Regulatory Effects on Private Property Rights:  The Department considered alternatives to the 
conditions imposed in this permit as part of the permit development.  The Department determined 
the permit conditions would be reasonably necessary to ensure compliance with applicable 
requirements and to demonstrate compliance with those requirements and would not unduly 
restrict private property rights.

Overall impacts to the physical and biological environmental parameters noted above would be 
minor because the activities would occur within the current mining area with little or no 
additional surface disturbance.  Furthermore, the current permit action would allow operation of a 
ROM coal stockpile, during the development phase of the mining operation, within the currently 
approved mine plan area.  This would result in a relatively small increase in air pollutant 
emissions above those associated with the current mining rate.  In the maximum emission 
scenario, there would be a particulate emission increase of less than 10 percent above the current 
permitted level.  All of the increase would be fugitive emissions.  There would be a small 
increase in air pollutant deposition in the area and in the use of water for dust suppression.  
Overall, the demands and impacts to terrestrial and aquatic life and habitats; water quality, 
quantity, and distribution; geology and soil quality, stability, and moisture; vegetation cover, 
quantity, and quality; and aesthetics related to the increased activities would be minor. 
 
F. 
Air Quality 
 
The air quality impacts from the increased activities would be minor because Permit #3179-02 
would include conditions limiting the visible emissions (opacity) from the plant operations, and 
would require water and/or chemical dust suppressant and other means to control air pollution.  
The plant operations would continue to be limited by Permit #3179-02 to total emissions of 250 
tons per year or less from non-fugitive sources, including any additional equipment used at the 
site.  This facility would continue to be considered a minor source of air pollution for the Title V 
program, because the facility’s potential emissions would be below 100 tons per year.  Overall, 
air emissions from the increased activities would have minor impacts on air quality in the 
immediate and surrounding area because of the relatively small amount of additional pollutants

generated.  Air pollution controls currently used at the facility, such as fabric filtration, chemical 
stabilization and/or water suppression, would reduce air emissions from equipment operations, 
storage piles, and haul roads.  
 
G. 
Unique Endangered, Fragile, or Limited Environmental Resources 
 
The increased activities would occur within the previously disturbed industrial site at the mine.  
As part of the MEPA analysis on initial mine development, assessments of potential impacts to 
unique endangered, fragile, or limited environmental resources were done by the Department, 
including contact with the Montana Natural Heritage Program – Natural Resource Information 
System (NRIS) to identify species of special concern at the mine site.  The likelihood that the 
operation of the ROM coal stockpile during the development phase of the mining operation 
would impact unique endangered, fragile, or limited environmental resources would be minor 
because of the relatively small increase in emissions, the lack of change to the mine plan area, 
and the conditions placed in Permit #3179-02. 
 
H. 
Demands on Environmental Resources of Water, Air, and Energy 
 
The increased activities would require minimal additional amounts of water, air, and energy.  
Limited amounts of water would be required to be used for dust control for the equipment, 
product stockpiles, and surrounding haul roads.  Further, as described in Section 7.F. of this EA, 
pollutant emissions generated from the operation would have minimal impacts on air quality in 
the immediate and surrounding area because of the relatively small increase in emissions, the lack 
of change to the mine plan area, and the conditions placed in Permit #3179-02.  Overall, the 
demands and impacts to the environmental resource of water, air, and energy related to the 
increased activities would be minor. 
 
I. 
Historical and Archaeological Sites  
 
The increased activities would occur within the previously disturbed industrial site at the mine.  
According to past correspondence from the Montana State Historic Preservation Office, there is 
low likelihood of adverse disturbance to any known archaeological or historic site because of 
previous industrial disturbance within the area.  Therefore, the likelihood that the increased 
activities would have an impact on historical or archaeological sites would be minor.   
 
J. 
Cumulative and Secondary Impacts 
 
The increased activities from the project would cause minor cumulative and secondary impacts to 
the physical and biological aspects of the human environment.  There would be a relatively small 
increase in air emissions of particulate matter and PM10 and no increase in the mine plan area.

SUMMARY OF COMMENTS ON POTENTIAL ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL EFFECTS:  
The following comments have been prepared by the Department. 
 
A. 
Social Structures and Mores 
B. 
Cultural Uniqueness and Diversity  
 
The Department determined that the current permit action would not have an impact on the social 
structures and mores or the cultural uniqueness and diversity of this area of operation because the 
operation of a ROM coal stockpile, during the development phase of the mining operation, is 
relatively minor and the activities would occur within the previously disturbed industrial area.  
The surrounding area would remain unchanged as a result of the proposed project. 
 
C. 
Local and State Tax Base and Tax Revenue  
 
The increased activities would have little or no impact on the local and state tax base and tax 
revenue.  No full time, permanent employees would be added as a result of issuing Permit #3179-
02.  The increase in the amount of equipment at the site would be minimal. 
 
D. 
Agricultural or Industrial Production 
 
The increased activities would occur within the previously disturbed industrial area; therefore, the 
Department would not expect an impact to or displacement of agricultural production.  The 
increased activities would be relatively small compared to the existing mining operation and 
would have only a minor impact on local industrial production.  In addition, the facility would 
operate within the permitted mining area, which upon completion of mining operations, would be 
reclaimed, as specified, by the Environmental Management Bureau (EMB) of the Department.  
3179-02 
18                                                                                        Final: 03/13/07 
Minor and temporary effects may occur to agricultural land, and the EMB would be responsible 
for oversight of any reclamation activities.  Therefore, impacts to agricultural or industrial 
production would be minor. 
 
E. 
Human Health 
 
 
Permit #3179-02 would incorporate conditions to ensure that the increased activities would be 
accomplished in compliance with all applicable air quality rules and standards.  These rules and 
standards are designed to be protective of human health.  As noted in Section 7.F. of this EA, the 
air emissions from this facility would be minimized by fabric filtration, water spray and/or 
chemical stabilization, and opacity limitations.  Furthermore, the increased activities and resulting 
air emissions would be relatively small.  Therefore, any associated impacts to human health 
would be minor based as a result of compliance with the applicable standards and operational 
conditions and limitations incorporated within the permit. 
 
F. 
Access to and Quality of Recreational and Wilderness Activities 
 
The increased activities would occur within the previously disturbed industrial property and 
would not impact access to recreational and wilderness activities.  Minor impacts on the quality 
of recreational activities could be created from the noise from the increased activities; however, 
these would be small in comparison to existing activities.  Emissions from the operation would be 
minimized as a result of the conditions that would be placed in Permit #3179-02.  Therefore, the 
associated impacts on the access to and quality of recreational and wilderness activities would be 
minor. 
 
G. 
Quantity and Distribution of Employment; and 
H. 
Distribution of Population 
 
As a result of the relatively small size of the operations associated with the increased activities, 
the quantity and distribution of employment and the distribution of population in the area would 
not be impacted.  No full time, permanent employees would be added as a result of issuing Permit 
#3179-02 and no related secondary employment would be expected.  Therefore, no impacts to the 
distribution of population in the area would be expected. 
 
I. 
Demands of Government Services 
 
Minor increases may be observed in the local traffic on existing roads in the area.  Very limited 
additional government services would be required relative to these operations.  Overall, demands 
for government services would be minor. 
 
J. 
Industrial and Commercial Activity  
 
The increased activities would represent only a minor increase in the industrial activity in the area 
because the operation of the ROM coal stockpile would operate during the development phase of 
the mining operation.  No additional commercial activity would result because no secondary 
activities are expected to move to the area as a result of the increased activities.  Overall, only a 
minor increase in industrial and commercial activity would be expected as a result of the 
proposed project.

K. 
Locally Adopted Environmental Plans and Goals 
 
The Department is not aware of any locally adopted environmental plans or goals that would be 
affected by the proposed project.  The state standards would protect the proposed site and the 
environment surrounding the site.  
 
L. 
Cumulative and Secondary Impacts 
 
 
The increased activities would cause minor cumulative and secondary impacts to the social and 
economic aspects of the human environment in the immediate area because of the small increase 
in potential air emissions.  Increases in traffic would have minor impacts on the local traffic in the 
immediate area.  Because the project would be a relatively small increase of particulate emissions 
compared to the current operation, only minor economic impacts to the local economy would be 
expected.  New businesses would not be drawn to any areas and permanent jobs would not be 
created or lost as a result of the proposed project.  Overall, the proposed project would have 
minor impacts to the cumulative and secondary impacts to the social and economic aspects of the 
human environment. 
 
Recommendation:  An Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) is not required. 
 
If an EIS is not required, explain why the EA is an appropriate level of analysis:  All potential effects 
resulting from the proposed increase in activities are minor; therefore, an EIS is not required.  In addition, 
the source would be applying the Best Available Control Technology and the analysis indicates 
compliance with all applicable air quality rules and regulations.
