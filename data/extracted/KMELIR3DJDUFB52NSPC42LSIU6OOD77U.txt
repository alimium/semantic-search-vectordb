North Atlantic right whale:  Coastal and offshore waters from the Altamaha River in Georgia to 
Sabastian Inlet in Florida.  There is a proposed rule to expand critical habitat to include all 
marine waters from Cape Fear, North Carolina, southward to about 45 miles north of Cape 
Canaveral, Florida.  
Loggerhead sea turtle:  There are 38 designated marine areas that occur throughout the Southeast 
Region.   
Green sea turtle:  Coastal waters surrounding Culebra Island, Puerto Rico.  
Hawksbill sea turtle:  Coastal waters surrounding Mona and Monito Islands, Puerto Rico. 
Leatherback sea turtle:  Coastal waters adjacent to Sandy Point from the mean high tide line to 
the hundred fathom curve, St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands. 
Gulf sturgeon:  There are 14 marine and estuarine units located in Northwest Florida, Alabama, 
Mississippi, and eastern Louisiana.   
Smalltooth sawfish:  There are two habitat units located in Charlotte Harbor and in the Ten 
Thousand Islands/Everglades, Florida.  
Elkhorn and Staghorn corals:  There are four designated marine areas in Florida, Puerto Rico, 
and the U.S. Virgin Islands (i.e., St. John/St. Thomas, and St. Croix).  
Johnson’s seagrass:  There are 10 designated habitat units located on Florida’s east coast.

Species Proposed for Listing  
Under the Endangered Species Act  
 Federal action agencies are encouraged to include species proposed for listing under the 
Endangered Species Act (ESA) in their Section 7 consultation requests.  Species that are 
proposed for listing are those which have been found to warrant federal protection under the 
ESA, but a final rule formally listing the species has not yet published.  By including these 
species in your Section 7 consultation, reinitiating consultation after the ESA listing is finalized 
may not be necessary.
