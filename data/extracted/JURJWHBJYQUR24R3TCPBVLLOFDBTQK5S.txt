ASSIGNMENT OF CRIMINAL MATTERS
TO MAGISTRATE JUDGES
(a)  Misdemeanor Cases. All misdemeanor cases shall be assigned, upon the filing of an information or
the return of an indictment, to one of the district judges and then delivered to a magistrate judge to
conduct the arraignment. All magistrate judges are specifically designated to exercise misdemeanor
jurisdiction. If the defendant consents to a trial of the case by a magistrate judge, the magistrate judge
shall proceed in accordance with the provisions of 18 U.S.C. § 3401 and Fed. R. Crim. P. 58. 
(b)  Felony Cases. Upon the return of an indictment or the filing of an information, all felony cases shall
be assigned by the Clerk of Court to one of the district judges and then delivered to a magistrate judge to
conduct an arraignment, to appoint counsel when appropriate, and to resolve other preliminary matters
pursuant to the  Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, including entry of the procedural order. Upon
receipt of a not guilty plea, the magistrate judge shall set the matter for trial before the assigned district
judge. If the defendant advises the magistrate judge that he or she wishes to enter a plea of guilty or
nolo contendere, the magistrate judge shall inform the district judge so the matter can be place on the
district judge’s calendar.
