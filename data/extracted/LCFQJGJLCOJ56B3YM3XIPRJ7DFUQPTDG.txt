Introduction 
Welcome to the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework: A Guide to Self-Certification. It is our hope that the 
Guide will provide U.S. organizations with a better understanding of the purpose and process of self-
certifying compliance with the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework. Additional information is available on 
our website: http://export.gov/safeharbor/ 
In the Guide, we have outlined the critical components of the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework. We 
have included not only Helpful Hints on Self-Certifying Compliance, but also a copy of the certification 
form. The Safe Harbor Privacy Principles and frequently asked questions (FAQs) have also been 
provided for easy reference. In addition, we have included several examples of organization privacy 
policies. Finally, we have provided a list of third-party dispute resolution providers and a glossary of key 
terms. The Guide is divided into nine major sections. What follows is a brief description of each section: 
Overview: The Overview provides background on the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework, including how 
it came about, the benefits of participation, and the basic eligibility criteria. The Overview also provides a 
summary of what the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles require. 
Helpful Hints on Self-Certifying Compliance: The Helpful Hints are meant to provide quick answers to 
questions U.S. organizations might have about the self-certification process, but this resource should be 
used in conjunction with the rest of the material covered in the Guide. The Helpful Hints also serve as a 
checklist, which should be reviewed to evaluate an organization’s readiness to self-certify. 
Safe Harbor Privacy Principles: We have provided the full text of the official declaration of the Safe 
Harbor Privacy Principles, as announced on February 16, 2009. This text is helpful in understanding the 
foundation of the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework. 
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs): The FAQs and answers, which clarify and supplement the Safe 
Harbor Privacy Principles, address many of the most commonly asked questions about the U.S.-Swiss 
Safe Harbor Framework. 
Certification Form: We have provided the Certification Form for easy reference, as it serves as the self-
certification application form.

Once submitted and approved, a completed certification form serves as a participating organization’s 
Safe Harbor List record. Applicants should apply online via our website (i.e. click on the “Safe Harbor 
Login / Certification Form” link on the left navigation bar: https://safeharbor.export.gov/login.aspx). 
Sample Privacy Policies: We have provided three sample privacy policies, which may serve as 
guidance when creating a new privacy policy or updating an existing one to conform to the U.S.-Swiss 
Safe Harbor Framework. Relevant privacy policies must include an affirmative commitment to the Safe 
Harbor Privacy Principles and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework. 
Dispute Resolution and Enforcement Options: We have provided a short description of the role of 
third-party dispute resolution providers (also referred to as ‘independent recourse mechanisms’), a list of 
such providers, and descriptions of the services provided by three of the listed providers. 
Glossary: A short glossary is also provided for many of the technical terms frequently used in the Guide.

Overview 
Background on the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor 
The Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection (FADP) went into effect in July 1993, and important 
modifications in January 2008. The FADP would prohibit the transfer of personal data to countries that do 
not meet Switzerland’s “adequacy” standard for privacy protection.  
While the United States and Switzerland share the goal of enhancing privacy protection for their citizens, 
the United States takes a different approach to privacy from that taken by Switzerland. The United States 
uses a sectoral approach that relies on a mix of legislation, regulation, and self-regulation. Switzerland, 
however, relies on comprehensive legislation that requires, among other things, the creation of an 
independent government data protection agency, registration of databases with this agency, and in some 
instances prior approval before personal data processing may begin. As a result of these differences, the 
comprehensive procedures set forth in Swiss law could have impacted the ability of U.S. organizations to 
engage in a range of transactions with Switzerland. 
In order to bridge these differences and provide a streamlined and cost-effective means for U.S. 
organizations to satisfy the Act’s “adequacy” requirement, the U.S. Department of Commerce in 
consultation with the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner of Switzerland developed a 
"Safe Harbor" framework. This arrangement was developed in accordance with the U.S.-Swiss Trade and 
Investment Cooperation Forum that had been established in 2006. The U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor 
Framework, which was approved by Switzerland in 2009, is an important way for U.S. organizations to 
avoid experiencing interruptions in their business dealings with Switzerland or facing prosecution by 
Swiss authorities under Swiss privacy law. Self-certifying to the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework will 
ensure that Swiss organizations know that your organization provides "adequate" privacy protection, as 
defined by Swiss law. 
 
U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Benefits 
The U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor program provides a number of important benefits to U.S. and Swiss 
organizations.

Benefits for participating U.S. organizations include: 
• 
Participating organizations will be deemed to provide “adequate” privacy protection; 
• 
Swiss requirements for prior approval of data transfers either will be waived or approval will be 
automatically granted; and  
• 
Claims brought by Swiss citizens against U.S. organizations will be heard, subject to limited 
exceptions, in the U.S.; and 
• 
Compliance requirements are streamlined and cost-effective, which should particularly benefit 
small and medium enterprises. 
A Swiss organization can ensure that it is sending information to a U.S. organization participating in the 
U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor program by viewing the public list of Safe Harbor organizations posted on the 
Safe Harbor website. This list contains the names of all U.S. organizations that have self-certified to the 
U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework. This list will be regularly updated, so that it is clear which 
organizations are assured of Safe Harbor benefits. 
 
How does an organization join? 
The decision by U.S. organizations to enter the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor program is entirely voluntary. 
Organizations that decide to participate in the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor program must comply with the 
U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework and publicly declare that they do so. To be assured of Safe Harbor 
benefits, an organization must self-certify annually in writing to the Department of Commerce that it 
agrees to adhere to the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor program requirements, which include elements such as 
notice, choice, access, and enforcement. It must also state in its published privacy policy statement that it 
complies with the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework and that it has certified its adherence to the Safe 
Harbor Privacy Principles. The Department of Commerce maintains a list of the organizations that file 
self-certification letters and makes both the list and the self-certification letters publicly available. 
To qualify for the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor, an organization can either join a self-regulatory privacy 
program that adheres to the Safe Harbor’s requirements or develop its own self-regulatory privacy policy 
that conforms to the Safe Harbor.

Moreover, only those organizations subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) or 
U.S. air carriers and ticket agents subject to the jurisdiction of the Department of Transportation (DoT) 
may participate in the Safe Harbor. Organizations generally not subject to FTC jurisdiction include certain 
financial institutions (e.g. banks, investment houses, credit unions, and savings & loan institutions), 
telecommunication common carriers, labor associations, non-profit organizations, agricultural co-
operatives, and meat processing facilities. In addition, the FTC’s jurisdiction with regard to insurance 
activities is limited to certain circumstances. If you are uncertain as to whether your organization falls 
under the jurisdiction of either the FTC or DoT, as certain exceptions to general ineligibility do exist, be 
sure to contact those agencies for more information. 
 
What do the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles require? 
Organizations must comply with the seven Safe Harbor Privacy Principles, which require the following: 
1. Notice 
Organizations must notify individuals about the purposes for which they collect and use information about 
them. They must provide information about how individuals can contact the organization with any 
inquiries or complaints, the types of third parties to which they disclose the information and the choices 
and means the organization offers for limiting its use and disclosure. 
2. Choice 
Organizations must give individuals the opportunity to choose (opt out) whether their personal information 
will be disclosed to a third party or used for a purpose incompatible with the purpose for which it was 
originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual. For sensitive information, affirmative or 
explicit (opt in) choice must be given if the information is to be disclosed to a third party or used for a 
purpose other than its original purpose or the purpose authorized subsequently by the individual.

3. Onward Transfer (Transfers to Third Parties) 
To disclose information to a third party, organizations must apply the notice and choice principles. Where 
an organization wishes to transfer information to a third party that is acting as an agent, it may do so if it 
makes sure that the third party subscribes to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles or is subject to the FADP 
or another adequacy finding. As an alternative, the organization can enter into a written agreement with 
such third party requiring that the third party provide at least the same level of privacy protection as is 
required by the relevant principles. 
4. Access 
Individuals must have access to personal information about themselves that an organization holds and be 
able to correct, amend, or delete that information where it is inaccurate, except where the burden or 
expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the individual’s privacy in the case 
in question, or where the rights of persons other than the individual would be violated. 
5. Security 
Organizations must take reasonable precautions to protect personal information from loss, misuse and 
unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. 
6. Data integrity 
Personal information must be relevant for the purposes for which it is to be used. An organization should 
take reasonable steps to ensure that data is reliable for its intended use, accurate, complete, and current. 
7. Enforcement 
In order to ensure compliance with the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles, there must be (a) readily available 
and affordable independent recourse mechanisms so that each individual’s complaints and disputes can 
be investigated and resolved and damages awarded where the applicable law or private sector initiatives 
so provide; (b) procedures for verifying that the commitments organizations make to adhere to the Safe 
Harbor Privacy Principles have been implemented; and (c) obligations to remedy problems arising out of 
a failure to comply with the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles.

Sanctions must be sufficiently rigorous to ensure compliance by the organization. Organizations that fail 
to provide annual self-certification letters reaffirming their commitment to the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor 
Framework and/or the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework will no longer be assured of the relevant Safe 
Harbor benefits and may ultimately be removed from the list of participants maintained on the Safe 
Harbor website.  
The Department of Commerce has issued a set of frequently asked questions and answers (FAQs) that 
clarify and supplement the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles.

Helpful Hints on Self-Certifying Compliance 
This section contains helpful hints on self-certifying compliance with the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor 
Framework and serves as a checklist that should be reviewed to evaluate an organization’s readiness to 
self-certify. Although this section provides succinct answers to many common questions regarding the 
self-certification process, this resource should be used in conjunction with the rest of the Guide, including 
the requirements for self-certification detailed in FAQ 6. 
The topics covered below include: determining whether your organization is subject to the jurisdiction of 
an appropriate statutory authority, developing a Safe Harbor compliant privacy policy statement, 
establishing a suitable independent recourse mechanism, ensuring that a suitable verification method is 
in place, and designating a contact within your organization regarding Safe Harbor.  
Confirm that Your Organization is Subject to the Jurisdiction of the U.S. Federal Trade 
Commission or the U.S. Department of Transportation: Any U.S. organization that is subject to the 
jurisdiction of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) or U.S. air carriers and ticket agents subject to the 
jurisdiction of the Department of Transportation (DoT) may participate in the Safe Harbor. The FTC and 
DoT have both stated in letters to the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner 
(FDPIC) (located with the Framework documents under Letters G and H) that they will take enforcement 
action against organizations that state that they are in compliance with the Framework, but then fail to live 
up to their statements. If you are uncertain as to whether your organization falls under the jurisdiction of 
either the FTC or DoT, then please be sure to contact those agencies for more information.  
Develop a Safe Harbor Compliant Privacy Policy Statement: Remember to develop a Safe Harbor 
compliant privacy policy before submitting a self-certification form to the Department of Commerce.  
• 
Make Sure that Your Privacy Policy Conforms to the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Privacy 
Principles: In order for a privacy policy to be compliant with the Framework, the privacy policy 
must conform to the seven Safe Harbor Privacy Principles, as well as any relevant points covered 
in the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs), which are located with the other Framework 
documents. In addition, the privacy policy should reflect your organization’s actual and anticipated 
information handling practices. It is also important to write a policy that is clear, concise, and easy 
to understand.

• 
Make Specific Reference in the Text of Your Privacy Policy to Your Organization's Safe 
Harbor Compliance: FAQ 6 requires each organization that self-certifies to state in its applicable 
published privacy policy that it complies with the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework and that it 
has certified its adherence to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles. In addition, each organization 
should include either a hyperlink to the Safe Harbor website or the corresponding URL (e.g., 
http://export.gov/safeharbor). 
• 
Provide an Accurate Privacy Policy Location and Make Sure that Your Privacy Policy is 
Available to the Public: At the time of self-certification, each organization must provide an 
accurate location for its applicable privacy policy. In addition, each organization should verify that 
its privacy policy is effective prior to self-certification. If your organization decides to post your 
privacy policy on an Internet or Intranet site, it must provide an accurate URL. 
o 
If your organization: 1) has a public website on which it has posted a general privacy 
policy statement or made any other representation regarding its privacy practices; and 2) 
has chosen to cover personal data (e.g., client or customer data) other than your 
organization’s own human resources data under its self-certification, then the posted 
privacy-related language must include an affirmative statement that your organization 
complies with the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework and has certified its adherence to 
the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles (i.e., it is not sufficient to simply upload a privacy 
policy to your organization’s Safe Harbor submission). In addition, the posted privacy-
related language must also include either a hyperlink to the Safe Harbor website or the 
corresponding URL (e.g., http://export.gov/safeharbor/).  
o 
If the information covered by your organization’s self-certification exclusively relates to 
your own organization’s human resources data, then the privacy policy covering such 
data need only be made available to your organization’s employees and as part of the 
Safe Harbor review process (i.e., your organization is not required to upload a copy to 
your organization’s Safe Harbor submission, but it is encouraged do so). If such a policy 
is listed as being located at corporate headquarters or on the corporate Intranet or is 
otherwise inaccessible to the general public via your organization’s public website, then 
your organization must provide the Department of Commerce with a copy of the policy so 
that it can be reviewed. If a copy of such a policy is provided for the reason just 
described, your organization must clarify whether or not it would object to having the copy 
uploaded to your organization’s Safe Harbor submission.

Establish Your Organization's Independent Recourse Mechanism: Under the Framework’s 
Enforcement Principle, organizations self-certifying must establish an independent recourse mechanism 
available to investigate unresolved complaints. (See FAQ 11 for more information regarding dispute 
resolution under Safe Harbor). The organization must ensure that its recourse mechanism is in place prior 
to self-certification. In addition, each organization should include in its privacy policy an appropriate 
reference to the independent recourse mechanism(s), as well as relevant contact information for said 
mechanism(s). 
In most cases, organizations self-certifying to Safe Harbor may choose to utilize private sector dispute 
resolution programs. While programs vary, organizations like the Council of Better Business Bureaus 
(BBB), TRUSTe, Direct Marketing Association (DMA), the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB), 
the American Arbitration Association (AAA), and JAMS have developed programs that assist in 
compliance with the Framework's Enforcement Principle and FAQ 11.  
Alternatively, organizations may choose to cooperate and comply with the Swiss Federal Data Protection 
and Information Commissioner (FDPIC). In doing so, an organization must follow the procedures outlined 
in FAQ 5.  
If organization human resources data (i.e. personal information about your organization's own 
employees, past or present, collected in the context of the employment relationship) is being covered in 
your organization's self-certification, your organization must comply with the FADP with respect to such 
data. Additional guidance on the handling of human resources data under the Framework is provided in 
FAQ 9.  
Ensure that Your Organization's Verification Mechanism is in Place: As discussed in FAQ 7, 
organizations self-certifying to the Framework are required to have procedures in place for verifying 
compliance. To meet this requirement, an organization may use either a self-assessment or a third-party 
assessment program. For additional guidance on the Framework's verification requirement, please see 
FAQ 7. 
Designate a Contact within Your Organization Regarding Safe Harbor: Each organization is required 
to provide a contact for the handling of questions, complaints, access requests, and any other issues 
arising under the Safe Harbor. This contact can be either the corporate officer that is certifying your 
organization's compliance with the Framework, or another official within your organization, such as a 
Chief Privacy Officer.

Safe Harbor Privacy Principles 
U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Privacy Principles 
Issued by the U.S. Department of Commerce on February 16, 2009 
The privacy legislation of Switzerland (Federal Act on Data Protection, FADP) was adopted by the Swiss 
Parliament on June 19, 1992.1 It requires that transfers of personal data take place only to third countries 
that provide an “adequate” level of privacy protection (Art. 6 FADP). While the United States and 
Switzerland share the goal of enhancing privacy protection for their citizens, the United States takes a 
different approach to privacy from that taken by Switzerland. The United States uses a sectoral approach 
that relies on a mix of legislation, regulation, and self regulation. Given those differences, many U.S. 
organizations have expressed uncertainty about the impact of the required “adequacy standard” on 
personal data transfers from Switzerland to the United States. 
To diminish this uncertainty and provide a more predictable framework for such data transfers, the 
Department of Commerce is issuing this document and Frequently Asked Questions (“the Principles”) 
under its statutory authority to foster, promote, and develop international commerce. As the Swiss and EU 
legislation on data protection may be considered equivalent, the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Principles and 
FAQs are modeled on the Principles and FAQs developed for the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor. They are 
intended for use by U.S. organizations receiving personal data from Switzerland for the purpose of 
qualifying for the Safe Harbor and the presumption of “adequacy” it creates. Because the Principles were 
solely designed to serve this specific purpose, their adoption for other purposes may be inappropriate.  
Decisions by organizations to qualify for the Safe Harbor are entirely voluntary, and organizations may 
qualify for the Safe Harbor in different ways. Organizations that decide to adhere to the Principles must 
comply with the Principles in order to obtain and retain the benefits of the Safe Harbor and publicly 
declare that they do so. For example, if an organization joins a self-regulatory privacy program that 
adheres to the Principles, it qualifies for the Safe Harbor. Organizations may also qualify by developing 
their own self-regulatory privacy policies provided that they conform with the Principles.

Where in complying with the Principles, an organization relies in whole or in part on self-regulation, its 
failure to comply with such self-regulation must also be actionable under Section 5 of the Federal Trade 
Commission Act prohibiting unfair and deceptive acts or another law or regulation prohibiting such acts. 
(See the annex for the list of U.S. statutory bodies recognized by Switzerland.) In addition, organizations 
subject to a statutory, regulatory, administrative or other body of law (or of rules) that effectively protects 
personal privacy may also qualify for Safe Harbor benefits. In all instances, Safe Harbor benefits are 
assured from the date on which each organization wishing to qualify for the Safe Harbor self-certifies to 
the Department of Commerce (or its designee) its adherence to the Principles in accordance with the 
guidance set forth in the Frequently Asked Question on Self-Certification. 
Adherence to these Principles may be limited: (a) to the extent necessary to meet national security, public 
interest, or law enforcement requirements; (b) by statute, government regulation, or case law that creates 
conflicting obligations or explicit authorizations, provided that, in exercising any such authorization, an 
organization can demonstrate that its non-compliance with the Principles is limited to the extent 
necessary to meet the overriding legitimate interests furthered by such authorization; or (c) if the effect of 
Swiss or cantonal data protection measures is to allow exceptions or derogations, provided they are 
applied in comparable contexts. Consistent with the goal of enhancing privacy protection, organizations 
should strive to implement these Principles fully and transparently, including indicating in their privacy 
policies where exceptions to the Principles permitted by (b) above will apply on a regular basis. For the 
same reason, where the option is allowable under the Principles and/or U.S. law, organizations are 
expected to opt for the higher protection where possible. 
Organizations may wish for practical or other reasons to apply the Principles to all their data processing 
operations, but they are only obligated to apply them to data transferred after they enter the Safe Harbor. 
To qualify for the Safe Harbor, organizations are not obligated to apply these Principles to personal 
information in manually processed filing systems. Organizations wishing to benefit from the Safe Harbor 
for receiving information in manually processed filing systems from Switzerland must apply the Principles 
to any such information transferred after they enter the Safe Harbor. An organization that wishes to 
extend Safe Harbor benefits to human resources personal information transferred from Switzerland for 
use in the context of an employment relationship must indicate this when it self-certifies to the 
Department of Commerce (or its designee) and conform to the requirements set forth in the Frequently 
Asked Question on Self-Certification.

Organizations will also be able to provide the safeguards necessary under Article 6(2) FADP if they 
include the Principles in written agreements with parties transferring data from Switzerland for the 
substantive privacy provisions, once the other provisions for such model contracts are authorized by the 
Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (hereafter “the Commissioner”). 
U.S. law will apply to questions of interpretation and compliance with the Safe Harbor Principles 
(including the Frequently Asked Questions) and relevant privacy policies by Safe Harbor organizations, 
except where organizations have committed to cooperate with the Commissioner. Unless otherwise 
stated, all provisions of the Safe Harbor Principles and Frequently Asked Questions apply where they are 
relevant. 
“Personal data” and “personal information” are data about an identified or identifiable individual that are 
within the scope of the FADP, received by a U.S. organization from Switzerland, and recorded in any 
form. 
Notice: An organization must inform individuals about the purposes for which it collects and uses 
information about them, how to contact the organization with any inquiries or complaints, the types of third 
parties to which it discloses the information, and the choices and means the organization offers 
individuals for limiting its use and disclosure. This notice must be provided in clear and conspicuous 
language when individuals are first asked to provide personal information to the organization or as soon 
thereafter as is practicable, but in any event before the organization uses such information for a purpose 
other than that for which it was originally collected or processed by the transferring organization or 
discloses it for the first time to a third party. 
In observing the Notice Principle, organizations should take note of Article 4(3) FADP, which provides, 
“Personal data may only be processed for the purpose indicated at the time of collection, that is evident 
from the circumstances, or that is provided by law.” 
It is not necessary to provide notice when disclosure is made to a third party that is acting as an agent to 
perform task(s) on behalf of and under the instructions of the organization (Art. 10a FADP). The Onward 
Transfer Principle, on the other hand, does apply to such disclosures. 
Choice: An organization must offer individuals the opportunity to choose (opt out) whether their personal 
information is (a) to be disclosed to a third party or (b) to be used for a purpose that is incompatible with 
the purpose(s) for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual.

Individuals must be provided with clear and conspicuous, readily available, and affordable mechanisms to 
exercise choice. 
For sensitive information (i.e., personal information specifying medical or health conditions, personal 
sexuality, racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious, ideological or trade union-related views or 
activities, or information on social security measures or administrative or criminal proceedings and 
sanctions, which are treated outside pending proceedings), they must be given affirmative or explicit (opt 
in) choice if the information is to be disclosed to a third party or used for a purpose other than those for 
which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual through the exercise of opt in 
choice (Art. 4(5) FADP). In any case, an organization should treat as sensitive any information received 
from a third party where the third party identifies and treats it as sensitive. 
In observing the Choice Principle, organizations should take note of Article 4(3) FADP, which provides, 
“Personal data may only be processed for the purpose indicated at the time of collection, that is evident 
from the circumstances, or that is provided by law.” 
It is not necessary to provide choice when disclosure is made to a third party that is acting as an agent to 
perform task(s) on behalf of and under the instructions of the organization (Art. 10a FADP). The Onward 
Transfer Principle, on the other hand, does apply to such disclosures. 
Onward Transfer: To disclose information to a third party, organizations must apply the Notice and 
Choice Principles. Where an organization wishes to transfer information to a third party that is acting as 
an agent, as described in the footnotes, it may do so if it first either ascertains that the third party 
subscribes to the Principles or is subject to the FADP or another adequacy finding or enters into a written 
agreement with such third party requiring that the third party provide at least the same level of privacy 
protection as is required by the relevant Principles. If the organization complies with these requirements, 
it shall not be held responsible (unless the organization agrees otherwise) when a third party to which it 
transfers such information processes it in a way contrary to any restrictions or representations, unless the 
organization knew or should have known the third party would process it in such a contrary way and the 
organization has not taken reasonable steps to prevent or stop such processing.

Security: Organizations creating, maintaining, using or disseminating personal information must take 
reasonable precautions to protect it from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and 
destruction. 
Data Integrity: Consistent with the Principles, personal information must be relevant for the purposes for 
which it is to be used. An organization may not process personal information in a way that is incompatible 
with the purposes for which it has been collected or subsequently authorized by the individual. To the 
extent necessary for those purposes, an organization should take reasonable steps to ensure that data is 
reliable for its intended use, accurate, complete, and current. 
Access: Individuals must have access to personal information about them that an organization holds and 
be able to correct, amend, or delete that information where it is inaccurate, except where the burden or 
expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the individual’s privacy in the case 
in question, or where the rights of persons other than the individual would be violated. 
Enforcement: Effective privacy protection must include mechanisms for assuring compliance with the 
Principles, recourse for individuals to whom the data relate affected by non-compliance with the 
Principles, and consequences for the organization when the Principles are not followed. At a minimum, 
such mechanisms must include: 
a) readily available and affordable independent recourse mechanisms by which each individual’s 
complaints and disputes are investigated and resolved by reference to the Principles and 
damages awarded where the applicable law or private sector initiatives so provide;  
b) follow up procedures for verifying that the attestations and assertions businesses make about 
their privacy practices are true and that privacy practices have been implemented as presented; 
and  
c) obligations to remedy problems arising out of failure to comply with the Principles by 
organizations announcing their adherence to them and consequences for such organizations.  
Sanctions must be sufficiently rigorous to ensure compliance by organizations.

I. Sensitive Data 
Q: Must an organization always provide explicit (opt in) choice with respect to sensitive data? 
A: No, such choice is not required where the processing is: (1) in the vital interests of the data subject or 
another person; (2) necessary for the establishment of legal claims or defenses; (3) required to provide 
medical care or diagnosis; (4) carried out in the course of legitimate activities by a foundation, association 
or any other non-profit body with a political, philosophical, religious or trade-union aim and on condition 
that the processing relates solely to the members of the body or to the persons who have regular contact 
with it in connection with its purposes and that the data are not disclosed to a third party without the 
consent of the data subjects; (5) necessary to carry out the organization’s obligations in the field of 
employment law; or (6) related to data that are manifestly made public by the individual. 
 
II. Journalistic Exceptions 
Q: Given U.S. constitutional protections for freedom of the press and the FADP’s exemption for 
journalistic material, do the Safe Harbor Principles apply to personal information gathered, maintained or 
disseminated for journalistic purposes? 
A: Where the rights of a free press embodied in the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution intersect 
with privacy protection interests, the First Amendment must govern the balancing of these interests with 
regard to the activities of U.S. persons or organizations. Personal information that is gathered for 
publication, broadcast, or other forms of public communication of journalistic material, whether used or 
not, as well as information found in previously published material disseminated from media archives, is 
not subject to the requirements of the Safe Harbor Principles. 
 
III. Secondary Liability 
Q: Are Internet service providers (ISPs), telecommunications carriers or other organizations liable under 
the Safe Harbor Principles when on behalf of another organization they merely transmit, route, switch or 
cache information that may violate their terms? 
A: No, as is the case with the FADP itself, the Safe Harbor does not create secondary liability.

To the extent that an organization is acting as a mere conduit for data transmitted by third parties and 
does not determine the purposes and means of processing those personal data, it would not be liable. 
 
IV. Investment Banking and Audits 
Q: The activities of auditors and investment bankers may involve processing personal data without the 
consent or knowledge of the individual. Under what circumstances is this permitted by the Notice, Choice, 
and Access Principles? 
A: Investment bankers or auditors may process information without knowledge of the individual only to the 
extent and for the period necessary to meet statutory or public interest requirements and in other 
circumstances in which the application of these Principles would prejudice the legitimate interests of the 
organization. These legitimate interests include the monitoring of companies’ compliance with their legal 
obligations and legitimate accounting activities, and the need for confidentiality connected with possible 
acquisitions, mergers, joint ventures, or other similar transactions carried out by investment bankers or 
auditors. 
 
V. The Role of the Commissioner 
Q: How will companies that commit to cooperate with the Federal Data Protection and Information 
Commissioner of Switzerland (the Commissioner) make those commitments and how will they be 
implemented? 
A: Under the Safe Harbor, U.S. organizations receiving personal data from Switzerland must commit to 
employ effective mechanisms for assuring compliance with the Safe Harbor Principles. They must 
provide, as specified in the Enforcement Principle: (a) recourse for individuals to whom the data relate; (b) 
follow-up procedures for verifying that the attestations and assertions they have made about their privacy 
practices are true; and (c) obligations to remedy problems arising out of failure to comply with the 
Principles and consequences for such organizations. An organization may satisfy points (a) and (c) of the 
Enforcement Principle if it adheres to the requirements of this FAQ for cooperating with the 
Commissioner. 
An organization may commit to cooperate with the Commissioner by declaring in its Safe Harbor 
certification to the Department of Commerce (see FAQ 6: Self-Certification) that the organization: 
 
 
 
 
 
The U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Guide to Self-Certification 
                               U.S. Department of Commerce 
 
20 
 
• 
Elects to satisfy the requirement in points (a) and (c) of the Safe Harbor Enforcement Principle by 
committing to cooperate with the Commissioner; 
• 
Will cooperate with the Commissioner in the investigation and resolution of complaints brought 
under the Safe Harbor; and 
• 
Will comply with any advice given by the Commissioner where the Commissioner takes the view 
that the organization needs to take specific action to comply with the Safe Harbor Principles, 
including remedial or compensatory measures for the benefit of individuals affected by any non-
compliance with the Principles, and will provide the Commissioner with written confirmation that 
such action has been taken. 
The cooperation of the Commissioner will be provided in the form of information and advice in the 
following way: 
• 
The advice of the Commissioner can be delivered directly.  
• 
The Commissioner will provide advice to the U.S. organizations concerned on unresolved 
complaints from individuals about the handling of personal information that has been transferred 
under the Safe Harbor. This advice will be designed to ensure that the Safe Harbor Principles are 
being correctly applied and will include any remedies for the individual(s) concerned that the 
Commissioner considers appropriate.  
• 
The Commissioner will provide such advice in response to referrals from the organizations 
concerned and/or to complaints received directly from individuals against organizations which 
have committed to cooperate with the Commissioner for Safe Harbor purposes, while 
encouraging and if necessary helping such individuals in the first instance to use the in-house 
complaint handling arrangements that the organization may offer.  
• 
Advice will be issued only after both sides have had a reasonable opportunity to comment and to 
provide any evidence they wish. The Commissioner will seek to deliver advice as quickly as this 
requirement for due process allows. 
• 
The Commissioner will make public the results of its consideration of complaints submitted to it, if 
it sees fit.  
• 
The delivery of advice through the Commissioner will not give rise to any liability for the 
Commissioner.

                               U.S. Department of Commerce 
 
21 
 
As noted above, organizations choosing this option must undertake to comply with the advice of the 
Commissioner. If an organization fails to comply with this advice and has offered no satisfactory 
explanation for its noncompliance, the Commissioner will give notice of its intention either to submit the 
matter to the Federal Trade Commission or other U.S. federal or state body with statutory powers to take 
enforcement action in cases of deception or misrepresentation, or to conclude that the agreement to 
cooperate has been seriously breached and must therefore be considered null and void. In the latter 
case, the Commissioner will inform the Department of Commerce (or its designee) so that the list of Safe 
Harbor participants can be duly amended. Any failure to fulfill the undertaking to cooperate with the 
Commissioner, as well as failures to comply with the Safe Harbor Principles, will be actionable as a 
deceptive practice under Section 5 of the FTC Act or other similar statute. 
 
VI. Self-Certification 
Q: How does an organization self-certify that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Principles? 
A: Safe Harbor benefits are assured from the date on which an organization self-certifies to the 
Department of Commerce (or its designee) its adherence to the Principles in accordance with the 
guidance set forth below. 
To self-certify for the Safe Harbor, organizations can provide to the Department of Commerce (or its 
designee) a letter – signed by a corporate officer on behalf of the organization that is joining the Safe 
Harbor – that contains at least the following information: 
• 
Name of the organization, mailing address, e-mail address, telephone and fax numbers; 
• 
Description of the activities of the organization with respect to personal information received from 
Switzerland; and 
• 
Description of the organization’s privacy policy for such personal information, including: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
The U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Guide to Self-Certification 
                               U.S. Department of Commerce 
 
22 
 
o 
where the privacy policy is available for viewing by the public,  
o 
its effective date of implementation,  
o 
a contact office for the handling of complaints, access requests, and any other issues 
arising under the Safe Harbor,  
o 
the specific statutory body that has jurisdiction to hear any claims against the 
organization regarding possible unfair or deceptive practices and violations of laws or 
regulations governing privacy (and that is listed in the annex to the Principles),  
o 
the name of any privacy programs in which the organization is a member,  
o 
the method of verification (e.g., in-house, third party) (see FAQ 7: Verification), and  
o 
the independent recourse mechanism that is available to investigate unresolved 
complaints. 
Where the organization wishes its Safe Harbor benefits to cover human resources information transferred 
from Switzerland for use in the context of the employment relationship, it may do so where there is a 
statutory body with jurisdiction to hear claims against the organization arising out of human resources 
information that is listed in the annex to the Principles. In addition, the organization must indicate this in 
its letter and declare its commitment to cooperate with the Commissioner or authorities concerned in 
conformity with FAQ 9: Human Resources and FAQ 5: the Role of the Commissioner as applicable and 
that it will comply with the advice given by such authorities. 
The Department (or its designee) will maintain a list of all organizations that file such letters, thereby 
assuring the availability of Safe Harbor benefits, and will update such list on the basis of annual letters 
and notifications received pursuant to FAQ 11: Dispute Resolution and Enforcement. Such self-
certification letters should be provided not less than annually. Otherwise the organization will be removed 
from the list and Safe Harbor benefits will no longer be assured. Both the list and the self-certification 
letters submitted by the organizations will be made publicly available. All organizations that self-certify for 
the Safe Harbor must also state in their relevant published privacy policy statements that they adhere to 
the Safe Harbor Principles. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Guide to Self-Certification 
                               U.S. Department of Commerce 
 
23 
 
The undertaking to adhere to the Safe Harbor Principles is not time-limited in respect of data received 
during the period in which the organization enjoys the benefits of the Safe Harbor. Its undertaking means 
that it will continue to apply the Principles to such data for as long as the organization stores, uses or 
discloses them, even if it subsequently leaves the Safe Harbor for any reason. 
An organization that will cease to exist as a separate legal entity as a result of a merger or a takeover 
must notify the Department of Commerce (or its designee) of this in advance. The notification should also 
indicate whether the acquiring entity or the entity resulting from the merger will: (1) continue to be bound 
by the Safe Harbor Principles by the operation of law governing the takeover or merger or (2) elect to self-
certify its adherence to the Safe Harbor Principles or put in place other safeguards, such as a written 
agreement that will ensure adherence to the Safe Harbor Principles. Where neither (1) nor (2) apply, any 
data that has been acquired under the Safe Harbor must be promptly deleted. 
An organization does not need to subject all personal information to the Safe Harbor Principles, but it 
must subject to the Safe Harbor Principles all personal data received from Switzerland after it joins the 
Safe Harbor. 
Any misrepresentation to the general public concerning an organization’s adherence to the Safe Harbor 
Principles may be actionable by the Federal Trade Commission or other relevant government body. 
Misrepresentations to the Department of Commerce (or its designee) may be actionable under the False 
Statements Act (18 U.S.C. § 1001). 
 
VII. Verification 
Q:  How do organizations provide follow up procedures for verifying that the attestations and assertions 
they make about their Safe Harbor privacy practices are true and those privacy practices have been 
implemented as represented and in accordance with the Safe Harbor Principles? 
A: To meet the verification requirements of the Enforcement Principle, an organization may verify such 
attestations and assertions either through self-assessment or outside compliance reviews. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Guide to Self-Certification 
                               U.S. Department of Commerce 
 
24 
 
Under the self-assessment approach, such verification would have to indicate that an organization’s 
published privacy policy regarding personal information received from Switzerland is accurate, 
comprehensive, prominently displayed, completely implemented and accessible. It would also need to 
indicate that its privacy policy conforms to the Safe Harbor Principles; that individuals are informed of any 
in-house arrangements for handling complaints and of the independent mechanisms through which they 
may pursue complaints; that it has in place procedures for training employees in its implementation, and 
disciplining them for failure to follow it; and that it has in place internal procedures for periodically 
conducting objective reviews of compliance with the above. A statement verifying the self-assessment 
should be signed by a corporate officer or other authorized representative of the organization at least 
once a year and made available upon request by individuals or in the context of an investigation or a 
complaint about non-compliance. 
Organizations should retain their records on the implementation of their Safe Harbor privacy practices 
and make them available upon request in the context of an investigation or a complaint about non-
compliance to the independent body responsible for investigating complaints or to the agency with unfair 
and deceptive practices jurisdiction. 
Where the organization has chosen outside compliance review, such a review needs to demonstrate that 
its privacy policy regarding personal information received from Switzerland conforms to the Safe Harbor 
Principles, it is being complied with, and individuals are informed of the mechanisms through which they 
may pursue complaints. The methods of review may include without limitation, auditing, random reviews, 
use of “decoys”, or use of technology tools as appropriate. A statement verifying that an outside 
compliance review has been successfully completed should be signed either by the reviewer or by the 
corporate officer or other authorized representative of the organization at least once a year and made 
available upon request by individuals or in the context of an investigation or a complaint about 
compliance. 
 
VIII. Access 
Access Principle: 
Individuals must have access to personal information about them that an organization holds and be able 
to correct, amend or delete that information where it is inaccurate, except where the burden or expense of 
providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the individual’s privacy in the case in question, 
or where the legitimate rights of persons other than the individual would be violated. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Guide to Self-Certification 
                               U.S. Department of Commerce 
 
25 
 
Q1: Is the right of access absolute? 
A1: No, under the Safe Harbor Principles, the right of access is fundamental to privacy protection. In 
particular, it allows individuals to verify the accuracy of information held about them. Nonetheless, the 
obligation of an organization to provide access to the personal information it holds about an individual is 
subject to the principle of proportionality or reasonableness and has to be tempered in certain instances. 
Indeed, the Explanatory Memorandum to the 1980 OECD Privacy Guidelines makes clear that an 
organization’s access obligation is not absolute. It does not require the exceedingly thorough search 
mandated, for example, by a subpoena, nor does it require access to all the different forms in which the 
information may be maintained by the organization. 
Rather, experience has shown that in responding to individuals’ access requests, organizations should 
first be guided by the concern(s) that led to the requests in the first place. For example, if an access 
request is vague or broad in scope, an organization may engage the individual in a dialogue so as to 
better understand the motivation for the request and to locate responsive information. The organization 
might inquire about which part(s) of the organization the individual interacted with and/or about the nature 
of the information (or its use) that is the subject of the access request. Individuals do not, however, have 
to justify requests for access to their own data. 
Expense and burden are important factors and should be taken into account but they are not controlling in 
determining whether providing access is reasonable. For example, if the information is used for decisions 
that will significantly affect the individual (e.g., the denial or grant of important benefits, such as insurance, 
a mortgage, or a job), then consistent with the other provisions of these FAQs, the organization would 
have to disclose that information even if it is relatively difficult or expensive to provide. 
If the information requested is not sensitive or not used for decisions that will significantly affect the 
individual (e.g., non-sensitive marketing data that is used to determine whether or not to send the 
individual a catalog), but is readily available and inexpensive to provide, an organization would have to 
provide access to factual information that the organization stores about the individual. The information 
concerned could include facts obtained from the individual, facts gathered in the course of a transaction, 
or facts obtained from others that pertain to the individual. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Guide to Self-Certification 
                               U.S. Department of Commerce 
 
26 
 
Consistent with the fundamental nature of access, organizations should always make good faith efforts to 
provide access. For example, where certain information needs to be protected and can be readily 
separated from other information subject to an access request, the organization should redact the 
protected information and make available the other information. If an organization determines that access 
should be denied in any particular instance, it should provide the individual requesting access with an 
explanation of why it has made that determination and a contact point for any further inquiries. 
Q2: What is confidential commercial information and may organizations deny access in order to 
safeguard it? 
A2: Confidential commercial information (as that term is used in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on 
discovery) is information which an organization has taken steps to protect from disclosure, where 
disclosure would help a competitor in the market. The particular computer program an organization uses, 
such as a modeling program, or the details of that program may be confidential commercial information. 
Where confidential commercial information can be readily separated from other information subject to an 
access request, the organization should redact the confidential commercial information and make 
available the non-confidential information. Organizations may deny or limit access to the extent that 
granting it would reveal its own confidential commercial information as defined above, such as marketing 
inferences or classifications generated by the organization, or the confidential commercial information of 
another where such information is subject to a contractual obligation of confidentiality in circumstances 
where such an obligation of confidentiality would normally be undertaken or imposed. 
Q3: In providing access, may an organization disclose to individuals personal information about them 
derived from its data bases or is access to the data base itself required? 
A3: Access can be provided in the form of disclosure by an organization to the individual and does not 
require access by the individual to an organization’s data base. 
Q4: Does an organization have to restructure its data bases to be able to provide access? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Guide to Self-Certification 
                               U.S. Department of Commerce 
 
27 
 
A4: Access needs to be provided only to the extent that an organization stores the information. The 
Access Principle does not itself create any obligation to retain, maintain, reorganize, or restructure 
personal information files. 
Q5: These replies make clear that access may be denied in certain circumstances. In what other 
circumstances may an organization deny individuals access to their personal information? 
A5: Such circumstances are limited, and any reasons for denying access must be specific. An 
organization can refuse to provide access to information to the extent that disclosure is likely to interfere 
with the safeguarding of important countervailing public interests, such as national security; defense; or 
public security. In addition, where personal information is processed solely for research or statistical 
purposes, access may be denied. Other reasons for denying or limiting access are: 
• 
Interference with execution or enforcement of the law, including the prevention, investigation or 
detection of offenses or the right to a fair trial; 
• 
Interference with private causes of action, including the prevention, investigation or detection of 
legal claims or the right to a fair trial; 
• 
Disclosure of personal information pertaining to other individual(s) where such references cannot 
be redacted; 
• 
Breaching a legal or other professional privilege or obligation; 
• 
Breaching the necessary confidentiality of future or ongoing negotiations, such as those involving 
the acquisition of publicly quoted companies; 
• 
Prejudicing employee security investigations or grievance proceedings; 
• 
Prejudicing the confidentiality that may be necessary for limited periods in connection with 
employee succession planning and corporate re-organizations; or 
• 
Prejudicing the confidentiality that may be necessary in connection with monitoring, inspection or 
regulatory functions connected with sound economic or financial management; or 
• 
Other circumstances in which the burden or cost of providing access would be disproportionate or 
the legitimate rights or interests of others would be violated.

                               U.S. Department of Commerce 
 
28 
 
An organization which claims an exception has the burden of demonstrating its applicability (as is 
normally the case). As noted above, the reasons for denying or limiting access and a contact point for 
further inquiries should be given to individuals. 
Q6: Can an organization charge a fee to cover the cost of providing access? 
A6: Yes, the OECD Guidelines recognize that organizations may charge a fee, provided that it is not 
excessive. Thus organizations may charge a reasonable fee for access. Charging a fee may be useful in 
discouraging repetitive and vexatious requests. 
Organizations that are in the business of selling publicly available information may thus charge the 
organization’s customary fee in responding to requests for access. Individuals may alternatively seek 
access to their information from the organization that originally compiled the data. 
Access may not be refused on cost grounds if the individual offers to pay the costs. 
Q7: Is an organization required to provide access to personal information derived from public records? 
A7: To clarify first, public records are those records kept by government agencies or entities at any level 
that are open to consultation by the public in general. It is not necessary to apply the Access Principle to 
such information as long as it is not combined with other personal information, apart from when small 
amounts of non-public record information are used for indexing or organizing public record information. 
However, any conditions for consultation established by the relevant jurisdiction are to be respected. 
Where public record information is combined with other non-public record information (other than as 
specifically noted above), however, an organization must provide access to all such information, 
assuming it is not subject to other permitted exceptions. 
Q8: Does the Access Principle have to be applied to publicly available personal information? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Guide to Self-Certification 
                               U.S. Department of Commerce 
 
29 
 
A8: As with public record information (see Q7), it is not necessary to provide access to information that is 
already publicly available to the public at large, as long as it is not combined with non-publicly available 
information. 
Q9: How can an organization protect itself against repetitious or vexatious requests for access? 
A9: An organization does not have to respond to such requests for access. For these reasons, 
organizations may charge a reasonable fee and may set reasonable limits on the number of times within 
a given period that access requests from a particular individual will be met. In setting such limitations, an 
organization should consider such factors as the frequency with which information is updated, the 
purpose for which the data are used, and the nature of the information. 
Q10: How can an organization protect itself against fraudulent requests for access? 
A10: An organization is not required to provide access unless it is supplied with sufficient information to 
allow it to confirm the identity of the person making the request. 
Q11: Is there a time within which responses must be provided to access requests? 
A11: Yes, organizations should respond without excessive delay and within a reasonable time period. 
This requirement may be satisfied in different ways as the explanatory memorandum to the 1980 OECD 
Privacy Guidelines states. For example, a data controller who provides information to data subjects at 
regular intervals may be exempted from obligations to respond at once to individual requests. 
 
IX. Human Resources 
Q1: Is the transfer from Switzerland to the United States of personal information collected in the context 
of the employment relationship covered by the Safe Harbor? 
A1: Yes, where a company in Switzerland transfers personal information about its employees (past or 
present) collected in the context of the employment relationship, to a parent, affiliate, or unaffiliated 
service provider in the United States participating in the Safe Harbor, the transfer enjoys the benefits of 
the Safe Harbor. In such cases, the collection of the information and its processing prior to transfer will 
have been subject to Swiss data protection laws, and any conditions for or restrictions on its transfer 
according to those laws will have to be respected. 
 
 
 
 
 
The U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Guide to Self-Certification 
                               U.S. Department of Commerce 
 
30 
 
The Safe Harbor Principles are relevant only when individually identified or identifiable records are 
transferred or accessed. Statistical reporting relying on aggregate employment data and/or the use of 
anonymized or pseudonymized data does not raise privacy concerns. 
Q2: How do the Notice and Choice Principles apply to such information? 
A2: A U.S. organization that has received employee information from Switzerland under the Safe Harbor 
may disclose it to third parties and/or use it for different purposes only in accordance with the Notice and 
Choice Principles. For example, where an organization intends to use personal information collected 
through the employment relationship for non-employment-related purposes, such as marketing 
communications, the U.S. organization must provide the affected individuals with choice before doing so, 
unless they have already authorized the use of the information for such purposes. Moreover, such 
choices must not be used to restrict employment opportunities or take any punitive action against such 
employees. 
In addition, employers should make reasonable efforts to accommodate employee privacy preferences. 
This could include, for example, restricting access to the data, anonymizing certain data, or assigning 
codes or pseudonyms when the actual names are not required for the management purpose at hand. 
To the extent and for the period necessary to avoid prejudicing the legitimate interests of the organization 
in making promotions, appointments, or other similar employment decisions, an organization does not 
need to offer notice and choice. 
Q3: How does the Access Principle apply? 
A3: The FAQs on access provide guidance on reasons which may justify denying or limiting access on 
request in the human resources context. Of course, employers in Switzerland must comply with local 
regulations and ensure that Swiss employees have access to such information as is required by Swiss 
law, regardless of the location of data processing and storage. The Safe Harbor requires that an 
organization processing such data in the United States will cooperate in providing such access either 
directly or through the Swiss employer.

31 
 
Q4: How will enforcement be handled for employee data under the Safe Harbor Principles? 
A4: In so far as information is used only in the context of the employment relationship, primary 
responsibility for the data vis-à-vis the employee remains with the company in Switzerland. It follows that, 
where Swiss employees make complaints about violations of their data protection rights and are not 
satisfied with the results of internal review, complaint, and appeal procedures (or any applicable 
grievance procedures under a contract with a trade union), they should be directed to the Commissioner 
or labor authority in the jurisdiction where the employee works. This also includes cases where the 
alleged mishandling of their personal information has taken place in the United States, is the 
responsibility of the U.S. organization that has received the information from the employer and not of the 
employer and thus involves an alleged breach of the Safe Harbor Principles, rather than of the FADP. 
This will be the most efficient way to address the often overlapping rights and obligations imposed by 
local labor law and labor agreements as well as data protection law. 
A U.S. organization participating in the Safe Harbor that uses Swiss human resources data transferred 
from Switzerland in the context of the employment relationship and that wishes such transfers to be 
covered by the Safe Harbor must therefore commit to cooperate in investigations by and to comply with 
the advice of the Commissioner in such cases. The Commissioner in this way will notify the Department 
of Commerce. If a U.S. organization participating in the Safe Harbor wishes to transfer human resources 
data from Switzerland and the Commissioner has not so agreed, the provisions of FAQ 5: the Role of the 
Commissioner will apply. 
 
X. Data Processing by Third Parties 
Q: When data is transferred from Switzerland to the United States only for processing purposes, will a 
contract be required, regardless of participation by the processor in the Safe Harbor? 
A: Yes, data controllers in Switzerland are always required to enter into a contract when a transfer for 
mere processing is made, whether the processing operation is carried out inside or outside Switzerland. 
(Article 10a FADP) The purpose of the contract is to protect the interests of the data controller (i.e. the 
person or body who determines the purposes and means of processing, who retains full responsibility for 
the data vis-à-vis the individual(s) concerned). The contract thus specifies the processing to be carried 
out and any measures necessary to ensure that the data are kept secure. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Guide to Self-Certification 
                               U.S. Department of Commerce 
 
32 
 
A U.S. organization participating in the Safe Harbor and receiving personal information from Switzerland 
merely for processing thus does not have to apply the Principles to this information, because the 
controller in Switzerland remains responsible for it vis-à-vis the individual in accordance with the relevant 
Swiss provisions (which may be more stringent than the equivalent Safe Harbor Principles). 
Because adequate protection is provided by Safe Harbor participants, contracts with Safe Harbor 
participants for mere processing do not require prior authorization (or such authorization will be granted 
automatically) as would be required for contracts with recipients not participating in the Safe Harbor or 
otherwise not providing adequate protection. 
 
XI. Dispute Resolution and Enforcement 
How should the dispute resolution requirements of the Enforcement Principle be implemented, and how 
will an organization’s persistent failure to comply with the Principles be handled? 
A: The Enforcement Principle sets out the requirements for Safe Harbor enforcement. How to meet the 
requirements of point (b) of the Principle is set out in FAQ 7: Verification. This FAQ addresses points (a)2 
and (c)3, both of which require independent recourse mechanisms. These mechanisms may take different 
forms, but they must meet the Enforcement Principle’s requirements. Organizations may satisfy the 
requirements through the following: 
• 
Compliance with private sector developed privacy programs that incorporate the Safe Harbor 
Principles into their rules and that include effective enforcement mechanisms of the type 
described in the Enforcement Principle; 
• 
Compliance with legal or regulatory supervisory authorities that provide for handling of individual 
complaints and dispute resolution; or  
• 
Commitment to cooperate with the Commissioner or authorized representatives.  
 
 
 
 
 
                                                           
2Section (a) of the Enforcement Principle concerns the obligation to provide “readily available and affordable independent recourse mechanisms 
by which each individual’s complaints and disputes are investigated and resolved by reference to the Principles and damages awarded where the 
applicable law or private sector initiatives so provide”  
3 Section (c) of the Enforcement Principle concerns the obligation to “remedy problems arising out of failure to comply with the Principles by 
organizations announcing their adherence to them and consequences for such organizations.”  
 
The U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Guide to Self-Certification 
                               U.S. Department of Commerce 
 
33 
 
This list is intended to be illustrative and not limiting. The private sector may design other mechanisms to 
provide enforcement, so long as they meet the requirements of the Enforcement Principle and the FAQs. 
Please note that the Enforcement Principle’s requirements are additional to the requirements set forth in 
paragraph 3 of the introduction to the Principles that self-regulatory efforts must be enforceable under 
Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act or similar statute. 
Recourse Mechanisms: 
Consumers should be encouraged to raise any complaints they may have with the relevant organization 
before proceeding to independent recourse mechanisms. Whether a recourse mechanism is independent 
is a factual question that can be demonstrated in a number of ways, for example, by transparent 
composition and financing or a proven track record. As required by the Enforcement Principle, the 
recourse available to individuals must be readily available and affordable. Dispute resolution bodies 
should look into each complaint received from individuals unless they are obviously unfounded or 
frivolous. This does not preclude the establishment of eligibility requirements by the organization 
operating the recourse mechanism, but such requirements should be transparent and justified (for 
example to exclude complaints that fall outside the scope of the program or are for consideration in 
another forum), and should not have the effect of undermining the commitment to look into legitimate 
complaints. In addition, recourse mechanisms should provide individuals with full and readily available 
information about how the dispute resolution procedure works when they file a complaint. Such 
information should include notice about the mechanism’s privacy practices, in conformity with the Safe 
Harbor Principles, where dispute resolution bodies are not required to conform with the Enforcement 
Principle. They may derogate from the Principles where they encounter conflicting obligations or explicit 
authorizations in the performance of their specific tasks. They should also co-operate in the development 
of tools such as standard complaint forms to facilitate the complaint resolution process. 
Remedies and Sanctions: 
The result of any remedies provided by the dispute resolution body should be that the effects of non-
compliance are reversed or corrected by the organization, in so far as feasible, and that future processing 
by the organization will be in conformity with the Principles and, where appropriate, that processing of the 
personal data of the individual who has brought the complaint will cease.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Guide to Self-Certification 
                               U.S. Department of Commerce 
 
34 
 
Sanctions need to be rigorous enough to ensure compliance by the organization with the Principles. A 
range of sanctions of varying degrees of severity will allow dispute resolution bodies to respond 
appropriately to varying degrees of non-compliance. Sanctions should include both publicity for findings of 
non-compliance and the requirement to delete data in certain circumstances. Dispute resolution bodies 
have discretion about the circumstances in which they use these sanctions. The sensitivity of the data 
concerned is one factor to be taken into consideration in deciding whether deletion of data should be 
required, as is whether an organization has collected, used or disclosed information in blatant 
contravention of the Principles. Other sanctions could include suspension and removal of a seal, 
compensation for individuals for losses incurred as a result of non-compliance and injunctive orders. 
Private sector dispute resolution bodies and self-regulatory bodies must notify failures of Safe Harbor 
organizations to comply with their rulings to the governmental body with applicable jurisdiction or to the 
courts, as appropriate, and to notify the Department of Commerce (or its designee). 
FTC Action: 
The FTC has committed to reviewing on a priority basis referrals received from privacy self-regulatory 
organizations, such as BBB and TRUSTe, and the Commissioner alleging non-compliance with the Safe 
Harbor Principles to determine whether Section 5 of the FTC Act prohibiting unfair or deceptive acts or 
practices in commerce has been violated. If the FTC concludes that is has reason(s) to believe Section 5 
has been violated, it may resolve the matter by seeking an administrative cease and desist order 
prohibiting the challenged practices or by filing a complaint in a federal district court, which if successful 
could result in a federal court order to same effect. The FTC may obtain civil penalties for violations of an 
administrative cease and desist order and may pursue civil or criminal contempt for violation of a federal 
court order. The FTC will notify the Department of Commerce of any such actions it takes. The 
Department of Commerce encourages other government bodies to notify it of the final disposition of any 
such referrals or other rulings determining adherence to the Safe Harbor Principles. 
Persistent Failure to Comply: 
If an organization persistently fails to comply with the Principles, it is no longer entitled to benefit from the 
Safe Harbor. Persistent failure to comply arises where an organization that has self-certified to the 
Department of Commerce (or its designee) refuses to comply with a final determination by any self-
regulatory or government body or where such a body determines that an organization frequently fails to 
comply with the Principles to the point where its claim to comply is no longer credible. In these cases, the 
organization must promptly notify the Department of Commerce (or its designee) of such facts. Failure to 
do so may be actionable under the False Statements Act (18 U.S.C. § 1001). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Guide to Self-Certification 
                               U.S. Department of Commerce 
 
35 
 
The Department (or its designee) will indicate on the public list it maintains of organizations self-certifying 
adherence to the Safe Harbor Principles any notification it receives of persistent failure to comply, 
whether it is received from the organization itself, from a self-regulatory body, or from a government body, 
but only after first providing thirty (30) days’ notice and an opportunity to respond to the organization that 
has failed to comply. Accordingly, the public list maintained by the Department of Commerce (or its 
designee) will make clear which organizations are assured and which organizations are no longer 
assured of Safe Harbor benefits. 
An organization applying to participate in a self-regulatory body for the purposes of re-qualifying for the 
Safe Harbor must provide that body with full information about its prior participation in the Safe Harbor. 
 
XII. Choice - Timing of Opt Out 
Q: Does the Choice Principle permit an individual to exercise choice only at the beginning of a 
relationship or at any time? 
A: Generally, the purpose of the Choice Principle is to ensure that personal information is used and 
disclosed in ways that are consistent with the individual’s expectations and choices. Accordingly, an 
individual should be able to exercise “opt out” (or choice) of having personal information used for direct 
marketing at any time subject to reasonable limits established by the organization, such as giving the 
organization time to make the opt out effective. An organization may also require sufficient information to 
confirm the identity of the individual requesting the “opt out”. In the United States, individuals may be able 
to exercise this option through the use of a central “opt out” program such as the Direct Marketing 
Association’s Mail Preference Service. Organizations that participate in the Direct Marketing Association’s 
Mail Preference Service should promote its availability to consumers who do not wish to receive 
commercial information. In any event, an individual should be given a readily available and affordable 
mechanism to exercise this option. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Guide to Self-Certification 
                               U.S. Department of Commerce 
 
36 
 
Similarly, an organization may use information for certain direct marketing purposes when it is 
impracticable to provide the individual with an opportunity to opt out before using the information, if the 
organization promptly gives the individual such opportunity at the same time (and upon request at any 
time) to decline (at no cost to the individual) to receive any further direct marketing communications and 
the organization complies with the individual’s wishes. 
 
XIII. Travel Information 
Q: When can airline passenger reservation and other travel information, such as frequent flyer or hotel 
reservation information and special handling needs, such as meals to meet religious requirements or 
physical assistance, be transferred to organizations located outside Switzerland? 
A: Such information may be transferred in several different circumstances. Under Article 6(2) FADP, 
personal data may be transferred to a third country “in the absence of legislation that guarantees 
adequate protection within the meaning of Article 6(1)” on the condition that: 
• 
It is necessary to provide the services requested by the consumer or to fulfill the terms of an 
agreement, such as a “frequent flyer” agreement; or  
• 
It has been unambiguously consented to by the consumer in the specific case.  
U.S. organizations subscribing to the Safe Harbor provide adequate protection for personal data and may 
therefore receive data transfers from Switzerland without meeting those conditions or other conditions set 
out in Article 6 FADP. Since the Safe Harbor includes specific rules for sensitive information, such 
information (which may need to be collected, for example, in connection with customers’ needs for 
physical assistance) may be included in transfers to Safe Harbor participants. In all cases, however, the 
organization transferring the information has to respect the law in Switzerland, which may inter alia 
impose special conditions for the handling of sensitive data.

XIV. Pharmaceutical and Medical Products 
Q1: If personal data are collected in Switzerland and transferred to the United States for pharmaceutical 
research and/or other purposes, do Swiss laws or the Safe Harbor Principles apply? 
A1: Swiss law applies to the collection of the personal data and to any processing that takes place prior to 
the transfer to the United States. The Safe Harbor Principles apply to the data once they have been 
transferred to the United States. Data used for pharmaceutical research and other purposes should be 
anonymized when appropriate. 
Q2: Personal data developed in specific medical or pharmaceutical research studies often play a valuable 
role in future scientific research. Where personal data collected for one research study are transferred to 
a U.S. organization in the Safe Harbor, may the organization use the data for a new scientific research 
activity? 
A2: Yes, if appropriate notice and choice have been provided in the first instance. Such a notice should 
provide information about any future specific uses of the data, such as periodic follow-up, related studies, 
or marketing. It is understood that not all future uses of the data can be specified, since a new research 
use could arise from new insights on the original data, new medical discoveries and advances, and public 
health and regulatory developments. Where appropriate, the notice should therefore include an 
explanation that personal data may be used in future medical and pharmaceutical research activities that 
are unanticipated. If the use is not consistent with the general research purpose(s) for which the data 
were originally collected, or to which the individual has consented subsequently, new consent must be 
obtained. 
Q3: What happens to an individual’s data if a participant decides voluntarily or at the request of the 
sponsor to withdraw from the clinical trial? 
A3: Participants may decide or be asked to withdraw from a clinical trial at any time. Any data collected 
previous to withdrawal may still be processed along with other data collected as part of the clinical trial; 
however, if this was made clear to the participant in the notice at the time he or she agreed to participate.

Question 4: Pharmaceutical and medical device companies are allowed to provide personal data from 
clinical trials conducted in Switzerland to regulators in the United States for regulatory and supervision 
purposes. Are similar transfers allowed to parties other than regulators, such as company locations and 
other researchers? 
A4: Yes, consistent with the Principles of Notice and Choice. 
Q5: To ensure objectivity in many clinical trials, participants, and often investigators, as well, cannot be 
given access to information about which treatment each participant may be receiving. Doing so would 
jeopardize the validity of the research study and results. Will participants in such clinical trials (referred to 
as “blinded” studies) have access to the data on their treatment during the trial? 
A5: No, such access does not have to be provided to a participant if this restriction has been explained 
when the participant entered the trial and the disclosure of such information would jeopardize the integrity 
of the research effort. Agreement to participate in the trial under these conditions is a reasonable forgoing 
of the right of access. Following the conclusion of the trial and analysis of the results, participants should 
have access to their data if they request it. They should seek it primarily from the physician or other 
health care provider from whom they received treatment within the clinical trial, or secondarily from the 
sponsoring company. 
Q6: Does a pharmaceutical or medical device firm have to apply the Safe Harbor Principles with respect 
to notice, choice, onward transfer, and access in its product safety and efficacy monitoring activities, 
including the reporting of adverse events and the tracking of patients/subjects using certain medicines or 
medical devices (e.g., a pacemaker)? 
A6: No, to the extent that adherence to the Principles interferes with compliance with regulatory 
requirements. This is true both with respect to reports by, for example, health care providers to 
pharmaceutical and medical device companies, and with respect to reports by pharmaceutical and 
medical device companies to government agencies like the Food and Drug Administration. 
Q7: Invariably, research data are uniquely key-coded at their origin by the principal investigator so as not 
to reveal the identity of individual data subjects. Pharmaceutical companies sponsoring such research do 
not receive the key. The unique key code is held only by the researcher, so that he/she can identify the 
research subject under special circumstances (e.g., if follow-up medical attention is required). Does a 
transfer from Switzerland to the United States of data coded in this way constitute a transfer of personal 
data that is subject to the Safe Harbor Principles? 
A7: No. This would not constitute a transfer of personal data that would be subject to the Principles.

XV. Public Record and Publicly Available Information 
Q: Is it necessary to apply the Notice, Choice and Onward Transfer Principles to public record information 
or publicly available information? 
A: It is not necessary to apply the Notice, Choice or Onward Transfer Principles to public record 
information, as long as it is not combined with non-public record information and as long as any 
conditions for consultation established by the relevant jurisdiction are respected. 
Also, it is generally not necessary to apply the Notice, Choice or Onward Transfer Principles to publicly 
available information unless the Swiss transferor indicates that such information is subject to restrictions 
that require application of those Principles by the organization for the uses it intends. Organizations will 
have no liability for how such information is used by those obtaining such information from published 
materials. 
Where an organization is found to have intentionally made personal information public in contravention of 
the Principles so that it or others may benefit from these exceptions, it will cease to qualify for the benefits 
of the Safe Harbor.

Appendix B: Sample Privacy Policies  
Included below for your reference are three examples of privacy policies, which were chosen at random 
and are not intended to serve as an official endorsement or a specific U.S. Government standard. They 
incorporate the requisite tenets of the Safe Harbor Frameworks while at the same time uniquely represent 
their individual company and their industry privacy concerns. Should you have any questions about what 
is required in the text of a privacy policy in order to be compliant with the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor 
Framework, please refer to the Helpful Hints on Self-Certifying Compliance. 
 
Privacy Policy Example A  
 
Data Privacy at XYZ XYZ has established a comprehensive privacy program, including a global privacy 
office and a chief privacy officer, designed to help us respect and protect your data privacy rights. This 
statement includes both XYZ’s Safe Harbor Privacy Statement and the Website Privacy Statement.  
Safe Harbor Privacy Statement For personal information of employees, consumers, healthcare 
professionals, medical research subjects and investigators, customers, investors, and government 
officials that XYZ receives from the European Economic Area and Switzerland, XYZ has committed to 
handling such personal information in accordance with the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles. XYZ’s Safe 
Harbor certification can be found at https://safeharbor.export.gov/list.aspx. For more information about the 
Safe Harbor Privacy Principles, please visit the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Safe Harbor website at 
http://export.gov/safeharbor/.  
XYZ Website Privacy Statement  
XYZ respects the privacy of visitors to its websites, as a result, we have developed this website privacy 
policy. This website privacy policy applies only to the operation of websites that directly link to this policy 
when you click on “privacy statement” in the website footer. Through this website XYZ will collect 
information that can identify you, such as your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, and 
other similar information (“Your Information”) when it is voluntarily submitted to us (how-ever, see 
discussion below about “IP Addresses” if you have a broadband connection). We will use Your 
Information to respond to requests you may make of us, and from time to time, we may refer to Your 
Information to better understand your needs and how we can improve our websites, products and 
services.

We may also use Your Information to contact you and/or provide you with general health information (like 
information on certain health conditions) as well as information about our products and services. We may 
also enhance or merge Your Information with data obtained from third parties for the same purposes.  
Any other information transferred by you in connection with your visit to this site (“Other Information” - that 
is, information that cannot be used to identify you) may be included in databases owned and maintained 
by XYZ or its agents. XYZ retains all rights to these databases and the information contained in them. 
Other Information we collect may include your IP Address and other information gathered through our 
weblogs and cookies (see below).  
This site may use a technology known as web beacons - sometimes called single-pixel gifs - that allow 
this site to collect web log information. A web beacon is a graphic on a web page or in an e-mail message 
designed to track pages viewed or messages opened. Web log information is gathered when you visit 
one of our websites by the computer that hosts our website (called a “webserver”). The webserver 
automatically recognizes some non-personal information, such as the date and time you visited our site, 
the pages you visited, the website you came from, the type of browser you are using (e.g., Internet 
Explorer), the type of operating system you are using (e.g., Windows 2000), and the domain name and 
address of your Internet service provider (e.g., AOL). We may also include web beacons in promotional e-
mail messages in order to determine whether messages have been opened.  
This website may use a technology called a “cookie”. A cookie is a piece of information that our 
webserver sends to your computer (actually to your browser file) when you access a website. Then when 
you come back our site will detect whether you have one of our cookies on your computer. Our cookies 
help provide additional functionality to the site and help us analyze site usage more accurately. For 
instance, our site may set a cookie on your browser that keeps you from needing to remember and then 
enter a password more than once during a visit to the site.  
This website uses Internet Protocol (IP) Addresses. An IP Address is a number assigned to your 
computer by your Internet service provider so you can access the Internet. Generally, an IP address 
changes each time you connect to the Internet (it is a “dynamic” address). Note, however, that if you have 
a broadband connection, depending on your individual circumstance, it is possible that your IP Address 
that we collect, or even perhaps a cookie we use, may contain information that could be deemed 
identifiable.

This is because with some broadband connections your IP Address doesn’t change (it is “static”) and 
could be associated with your personal computer. We use your IP address to report aggregate 
information on use and to help improve the website.  
You should be aware that this site is not intended for, or designed to attract, individuals under the age of 
18. We do not collect personally identifiable information from any person we actually know is an individual 
under the age of 18.  
Areas of this website that collect Your Information use industry standard secure socket layer encryption 
(SSL); however, to take advantage of this your browser must support encryption protection (found in 
Internet Explorer release 3.0 and above).  
We may share Your Information with agents, contractors or partners of XYZ in connection with services 
that these individuals or entities perform for, or with, XYZ. These agents, contractors or partners are 
restricted from using this data in any way other than to provide services for XYZ, or services for the 
collaboration in which they and XYZ are engaged (for example, some of our products are developed and 
marketed through joint agreements with other companies). We may, for example, provide your 
information to agents, contractors or partners for hosting our databases, for data processing services, or 
so that they can mail you information that you requested.  
XYZ reserves the right to share Your Information to respond to duly authorized information requests of 
governmental authorities or where required by law. In exceptionally rare circumstances where national, 
state or company security is at issue (such as with the World Trade Center terrorist act in September, 
2001), XYZ reserves the right to share our entire database of visitors and customers with appropriate 
governmental authorities.  
We may also provide Your Information to a third party in connection with the sale, assignment, or other 
transfer of the business of this website to which the information relates, in which case we will require any 
such buyer to agree to treat Your Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.  
As a convenience to our visitors, this Website currently contains links to a number of sites that we believe 
may offer useful information. The policies and procedures we described here do not apply to those sites. 
We suggest contacting those sites directly for information on their privacy, security, data collection, and 
distribution policies.

XYZ Safe Harbor Policy  
Introduction  
XYZ, Inc. (the “Company”) is a leading pure-play managed services provider that offers security 
assessment, detection and prevention services that help companies, governments and organizations 
safeguard their computer networks and systems. Protecting consumer privacy is important to the 
Company. The Company and its affiliated United States subsidiaries (hereinafter collectively referred to

personal data from the European Union (“EU”) and Switzerland to the United States of America. 
Accordingly, we follow the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles published by the U.S. Department of 
Commerce (the “Principles”) with respect to all such data. If there is any conflict between the policies in 
this privacy policy and the Principles, the Principles shall govern. This privacy policy outlines our general 
policy and practices for implementing the Principles, including the types of information we gather, how we 
use it and the notice and choice affected individuals have regarding our use of and their ability to correct 
that information. This privacy policy applies to all personal information received by the Company whether 
in electronic, paper or verbal format.

Definitions  
“Personal Information” or “Information” means information that (1) is transferred from the EU and 
Switzerland to the United States; (2) is recorded in any form; (3) is about, or pertains to a specific 
individual; and (4) can be linked to that individual.  
 “Sensitive Personal Information” means personal information that reveals race, ethnic origin, sexual 
orientation, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership or that concerns 
an individual’s health.  
Principles  
Notice  
Company shall inform an individual of the purpose for which it collects and uses the Personal Information 
and the types of non-agent third parties to which the Company discloses or may disclose that Information. 
Company shall provide the individual with the choice and means for limiting the use and disclosure of 
their Personal Information. Notice will be provided in clear and conspicuous language when individuals 
are first asked to provide Personal Information to the Company, or as soon as practicable thereafter, and 
in any event before the Company uses or discloses the Information for a purpose other than for which it 
was originally collected.  
Choice  
The Company will offer individuals the opportunity to choose (opt out) whether their Personal Information 
is (1) to be disclosed to a third party or (2) to be used for a purpose other than the purpose for which it 
was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual. For Sensitive Personal Information, 
the Company will give individuals the opportunity to affirmatively or explicitly (opt out) consent to the 
disclosure of the information for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected or 
subsequently authorized by the individual. Company shall treat Sensitive Personal Information received 
from an individual the same as the individual would treat and identify it as Sensitive Personal Information.

Onward Transfers  
Prior to disclosing Personal Information to a third party, Company shall notify the individual of such 
disclosure and allow the individual the choice (opt out) of such disclosure. Company shall ensure that any 
third party for which Personal Information may be disclosed subscribes to the Principles or are subject to 
law providing the same level of privacy protection as is required by the Principles and agree in writing to 
provide an adequate level of privacy protection.  
Data Security  
Company shall take reasonable steps to protect the Information from loss, misuse and unauthorized 
access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. Company has put in place appropriate physical, electronic 
and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the Information from loss, misuse, unauthorized 
access or disclosure, alteration or destruction. Company cannot guarantee the security of Information on 
or transmitted via the Internet.  
Data Integrity  
Company shall only process Personal Information in a way that is compatible with and relevant for the 
purpose for which it was collected or authorized by the individual. To the extent necessary for those 
purposes, Company shall take reasonable steps to ensure that Personal Information is accurate, 
complete, current and reliable for its intended use.  
Access  
Company shall allow an individual access to their Personal Information and allow the individual to correct, 
amend or delete inaccurate information, except where the burden or expense of providing access would 
be disproportionate to the risks to the privacy of the individual in the case in question or where the rights 
of persons other than the individual would be violated.  
Enforcement  
Company uses a self-assessment approach to assure compliance with this privacy policy and periodically 
verifies that the policy is accurate, comprehensive for the information intended to be covered, prominently 
displayed, completely implemented and accessible and in conformity with the Principles.

Appendix C: Dispute Resolution and Enforcement Options 
Under the Safe Harbor Enforcement Principle, organizations self-certifying to one or both of the Safe 
Harbor Frameworks must establish an independent recourse mechanism (i.e. third party dispute 
resolution provider) to investigate unresolved complaints. An organization wishing to self-certify must 
ensure that a suitable mechanism is in place prior to self-certification. 
If an organization’s self-certification covers human resources data received from Switzerland and/or the 
EU/EEA regarding its own employees (i.e. organization human resources data, as opposed to 
customer/client human resources data), then it must agree to cooperate and comply with the Swiss 
Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC) and/or the EU data protection authorities 
(DPAs) with respect to such data.  
Provision has also been made for organizations to choose, even where organization human resources 
data are not involved, to cooperate with the appropriate data protection authorities in order to satisfy the 
Enforcement Principle’s dispute resolution and remedy requirements. 
In short, where an organization’s self-certification does not cover organization human resources data it 
may meet the relevant requirements by:  
a) Putting in place a suitable private sector developed mechanism; or  
b) Cooperating and complying with the appropriate data protection authorities   
In contrast, where an organization’s self-certification does cover organization human resources data it 
may meet the relevant requirements by: 
a) Cooperating and complying with the appropriate data protection authorities with respect to all 
types of data; or  
b) Cooperating and complying with the appropriate data protection authorities exclusively with 
respect to organization human resources data and using a suitable private sector developed 
mechanism for all other types of data (e.g. customer/client, clinical trial, etc.) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Guide to Self-Certification 
                               U.S. Department of Commerce 
 
55 
 
Although private sector developed mechanisms vary, the specific mechanism chosen must consist of 
either: 
a) A mechanism provided as part of a program, such as those managed by the Council of Better 
Business Bureaus (BBB), TRUSTe or Direct Marketing Association (DMA), that incorporates the 
Safe Harbor Framework; or 
b) An outside arbitration and mediation mechanism, such as those offered by the American 
Arbitration Association (AAA) and JAMS, that agrees to hear each complaint in compliance with 
the Safe Harbor Framework

BBB EU Safe Harbor Dispute Resolution Procedure 
The Council of Better Business Bureaus (“BBB”) is an unbiased organization that fosters honest and 
responsive relationships between businesses and consumers– instilling consumer confidence and 
contributing to a trustworthy marketplace. BBB provides objective advice, free business Reliability 
Reports and charity Wise Giving Reports, and educational information on topics affecting marketplace 
trust. To further promote trust, BBB also offers complaint and dispute resolution support for consumers 
and businesses when there is difference in viewpoints. 
The BBB EU Safe Harbor Dispute Resolution Procedure (“Procedure”) fulfills the dispute resolution 
mechanism requirement of the Department of Commerce’s Safe Harbor Certification Program. As a 
recognized leader in business-to-consumer dispute resolution programs, the BBB provides for the review 
of complaints filed by EU citizens alleging that a business participating in the Procedure has failed to 
comply with the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles. 
In the event that the BBB Procedure receives a complaint from an EU citizen, the first step in the dispute 
resolution process is for the BBB Procedure to contact the business. The BBB Procedure will ensure that 
the complainant has made a good faith effort to resolve his or her claim directly with the business, and 
then will attempt an informal mediation between the EU citizen and the business with the goal of rectifying 
the EU citizen’s concern.  
If the BBB Procedure is unable to address the EU citizen’s concerns informally with the business, the 
second step is the more formal Data Privacy Review (“Review”). In the Review, the complainant submits 
a statement of his or her complaint, which is forwarded to the business. The business replies with an 
answer. Each party has one further opportunity to respond. When all information has been submitted, the 
BBB Procedure reviews the information and will issue a decision. If appropriate, the BBB Procedure will 
recommend corrective action to the business to ensure that all Safe Harbor Privacy Principles are met. 
The third step in the Procedure is the Data Privacy Appeal. Both parties have the right to appeal the 
Review decision. In the event of an appeal, the case will be forwarded by the BBB to an independent 
expert in the privacy field. The appeal will be determined by the expert, who will issue a final decision in 
the case.

TRUSTe's final determination or face removal from the TRUSTe program, possible publication of that 
removal, and/or referral to an appropriate law-enforcement body.

Appendix D: Swiss Economy and Data Protection 
Switzerland and the United States are bound by close ties. Known as the "Sister Republics," they have a 
long history of shared democratic values. Both countries rely on an open market economy, support free 
enterprise, private initiative, a competitive market, and aim at high living standards.  
Switzerland is not a Member of the European Union. Rooted in tradition and history, the Swiss do not 
want to give up very comprehensive democratic rights and put a strong emphasis on a very carefully 
crafted political system establishing a delicate balance between four linguistic and several religious 
groups. For the time being, they manage their relations with the EU with several economic agreements. 
 
Swiss Economy in Brief 
Switzerland is a small country with a population of only about 7.6 million people, including 1.7 million 
foreigners. Nevertheless, it is one of the world's most advanced and prosperous nations. Considering 
GDP per capita, Switzerland is one of the richest countries in the world. 
Services is the largest sector of the economy with 72% of the labor force, followed by industry (24%) and 
agriculture (4%). Tourism, financial services, insurance, commerce, transport and health are very 
important branches of the tertiary sector. The industrial sector has become very specialized in the past 
twenty years. Swiss machinery, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, medical instruments and watches are sold 
all around the globe. Swiss manufacturing has a worldwide reputation for high-quality standards, reliability 
and diligence, accounts for 20% of GDP and is thus pivotal in creating jobs and wealth. Switzerland aims 
at maintaining in the future a strong manufacturing sector because it is essential for keeping, in turn, a 
strong services sector. 
 
U.S.-Swiss Economic Relations 
Switzerland is the 16th largest foreign market for the U.S. - ahead of India, Italy and Russia4. On the other 
hand, the U.S. is the second most important export market for Switzerland. Bilateral trade flows are 
significant: in 2010, Swiss exports to the U.S. amounted to USD 19.1 billion, while imports from the U.S. 
to Switzerland added up to USD 20.7 billion. Switzerland imports more goods from the U.S. than Austria, 
Denmark, Finland, Norway and Portugal combined!

Regarding trade in services, Switzerland is the 8th largest export market for the U.S. (2010: USD 20.3 bn) 
- ahead of France, India, and Brazil. Conversely, Switzerland is the 6th largest provider of services to the 
USA. With a value of USD 19.7 billion, Switzerland outpaces Mexico, France, China, and India.  
  
Swiss-U.S. investment relations are very strong. Attracted by excellent infrastructure, highly-educated 
work force and a favorable tax and regulatory environment, numerous U.S. firms have established 
operations in Switzerland. U.S. direct investment stock in Switzerland is estimated at USD 143.6 billion; 
more than in China, Brazil, and Russia combined! At the same time, many Swiss firms show a significant 
presence in the U.S. With an estimated direct investment stock of USD 140.7 billion (2009), a figure 
equivalent to about 7% of all foreign direct investments in the U.S., Switzerland is the 8th most important 
foreign direct investor in the U.S.. 
Over the years, Switzerland and the U.S. have concluded numerous agreements and have strengthened 
their ties with a Joint Economic Commission (2000) dealing with broad strategic issues, a Trade and 
Investment Cooperation Forum (2006) focusing on market access for firms and cooperation schemes, 
and, a political dialogue (2006) in areas of common interest such as democracy and security.  
 
Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection 
Switzerland and the United States take different approaches when it comes to the protection of privacy. 
The U.S. uses a sectoral approach that relies on a mix of legislation, regulation, and self-regulation. 
Switzerland, however, relies on comprehensive legislation that requires an independent government data 
protection agency, registration of data bases with this agency, and in some cases prior information before 
personal data processing may begin. For a better understanding of the Swiss approach regarding 
personal data protection, it may be worthwhile to highlight the key elements of the Swiss Federal Data 
Protection Act (FADP).  
The purpose of the FADP is to protect the privacy, interests, and fundamental rights of data subjects. 
Furthermore, it has as its central goal the maintenance of good data file practice; and the facilitation of 
international data exchange by providing a comparable level of protection.

In Switzerland, the right to privacy is guaranteed in article 13 of the Swiss Federal Constitution. The 
Federal Data Protection Act (FADP) and the Swiss Federal Data Protection Ordinance (DPO) entered into 
force on July 1, 1993. The FADP extends the protection of private persons (natural and legal persons) 
provided by the Swiss Civil Code (SCC) and regulates in a more detailed manner the processing of data 
by Federal authorities. The FADP, however, does not apply to the Cantons. The Cantons have their own 
data protection legislation. The FADP provides an overall framework and deals with data protection using 
principles similar to those applied in other countries (especially in the EU). Private persons need no 
authorization to process data and registration with the Federal Data Register is required only in certain 
specific cases. The law covers both the private and public sector, in order to ensure harmonized 
development and to facilitate the access of individuals to the data protection system. 
On March 24, 2006, a revision of the FADP as well as a federal decree were adopted, strengthening the 
position of data subjects by requiring greater transparency in the processing of personal data. In 
particular, it introduces a duty of information towards data subjects when collecting personal data that are 
either especially sensitive or concern a personality profile. New rules also apply to the cross-border 
transfer of data. As a result, it is no longer necessary to report the transmission of personal data that are 
sent outside Switzerland as long as the receiving country guarantees adequate data protection. 
Provisions relating to the notification of data files have been adapted to the new transparency 
requirements. A new and innovative provision introduces the possibility of obtaining the certification of 
personal data processing products and systems, and, under certain conditions, requires the owners of 
data sets to designate a data protection officer. Last, but not least, the Swiss Federal Data Protection and 
Information Commissioner (FDPIC) is empowered to appeal any order of the Federal Chancellery or of 
the Departments (Ministries) if a recommendation he has made is rejected. He also might refer a matter 
to the Federal Administrative Court for a decision if a private person does not comply with or rejects a 
recommendation. These changes have been in effect since 1st January 2008. 
Main Provisions of the Federal Data Protection Act 
The FADP is very wide in its scope and applies to processing of personal data carried out by Federal 
authorities, private organizations (including legal persons), and individual private persons (excluding 
those for normal private purposes). Data collections kept by journalists and by the media are covered 
under Art. 10, and benefit from several exemptions (i.e. provisions regarding freedom of the press and 
speech).

The law covers data relating to both private and legal persons and applies to electronic data processing 
(EDP) as well as manual files (Art. 2, Art. 3 para. a). Sensitive data - such as that relating to religion, 
political beliefs, trade union activities, health, race, social assistance or criminal records - enjoy more 
enhanced protection in various respects. 
Any data processing must ensure accuracy and be balanced. The collection of personal data and in 
particular the purpose of its processing must be evident to the data subject (Art.4 para. 4). In the case of 
processing of sensitive personal data or personality profiles, the data subject must give its explicit 
consent. Furthermore, data must be secured against unauthorized access (Art. 7), and data subjects 
must have a right of access (Art. 8) and have the right to correct errors (Art. 5). 
The processing of personal data may be assigned to third parties by agreement or by law if the data is 
processed only in the manner permitted for the instructing party itself and if it is not prohibited by a 
statutory or contractual duty of confidentiality (Art. 10a). In addition, the instructing party must in particular 
ensure that the third party guarantees data security. 
All data files held by Federal authorities must be registered with the Federal Data Protection and 
Information Commissioner (FDPIC). Private persons only have to register data collections if they include 
sensitive data or if the data is communicated regularly to third persons, and where the file controller is not 
under a legal obligation to process the data. With the revision of the FADP, the notification procedure has 
been simplified and the owners of data sets can register on line.  
The demand for more transparency in data processing (Art. 4, para. 4, Art. 14) also has an impact on the 
duty to register data collections. Federal bodies must continue to register their data collections as in the 
past. However, the requirement has been extended to cover the private sector. As a result, all owners of 
data sets will be required to register their collections if they regularly process highly sensitive personal 
data or personality profiles, or if they regularly disclose personal data to third parties, even if the persons 
concerned have been duly informed. As a result, it is now compulsory to register all data collections which 
were not subject to a registration obligation before the entry into force of the revised FADP. Data 
collections will have to be registered before they can be opened (Art. 11a, para. 4). 
However, the law also provides for certain exceptions to the compulsory registration requirement (Art. 
11a, para. 5). The Federal Council established the detailed rules relating to the implementation in the 
DPO.

Cross-border Data Transfers 
The FADP regulates the transborder transfer of data in those cases when there is a need for the 
protection of privacy. The transfer of data abroad is not permitted if adequate data protection cannot be 
assured (Art. 6 para. 1). Art. 6 FADP needed to be adapted in 2006 as a consequence of the decree of 
the Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of 
Personnel Data (Convention ETS 108). The Convention aims at a comparable level of data protection at 
the highest level possible, and unrestricted transborder data transfer between contracting states; as well 
as a guarantee that the transfer of personal data to a data recipient who is not covered by the Convention 
will only be authorized if the recipient state or the recipient organization can guarantee an appropriate 
level of protection. 
The notification under the former FADP that required the disclosure of transborder data transfer has been 
replaced by the duty of care and a selective duty to inform (Art. 6 para. 3 FADP). In general, this means 
that private individuals and federal bodies transferring data abroad must comply with the principles of 
FADP (Art. 4 FADP), ensure data security and the right to information of persons whose data is being 
transferred. If data protection cannot be guaranteed, it must be secured through other guarantees 
according to Art. 6 para. 2 FADP. The appropriateness of protection in the legislation of the target country 
is ensured when it is in accordance with the principles set out in Convention ETS 108. In order to 
ascertain compliance with the appropriateness principle, the data exporter may rely on the list of states 
published by the FDPIC (http://www.edoeb.admin.ch/themen/00794/00827/index.html?lang=en). The list 
includes states which are contracting parties to Convention ETS 108 and the additional Protocol, or 
according to the FDPIC, provide an adequate level of data protection.

Appendix E: U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework 
Background on the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor 
The European Commission’s Directive on Data Protection (the Directive) went into effect in October 1998, 
and would prohibit the transfer of personal data to non-European Union countries that do not meet the 
European Union (EU) “adequacy” standard for privacy protection. 
While the United States and the EU share the goal of enhancing privacy protection for their citizens, the 
United States takes a different approach to privacy from that taken by the EU. The United States uses a 
sectoral approach that relies on a mix of legislation, regulation, and self-regulation. The EU, however, 
relies on comprehensive legislation that requires, among other things, the creation of independent 
government data protection agencies, registration of databases with those agencies, and in some 
instances prior approval before personal data processing may begin. As a result of these differences, the 
Directive could have significantly hampered the ability of U.S. organizations to engage in a range of trans-
Atlantic transactions. 
In order to bridge these differences and provide a streamlined and cost-effective means for U.S. 
organizations to satisfy the Directive’s “adequacy” requirement, the U.S. Department of Commerce in 
consultation with the European Commission developed a "Safe Harbor" framework. The U.S.-EU Safe 
Harbor Framework, which was approved by the EU in 2000, is an important way for U.S. organizations to 
avoid experiencing interruptions in their business dealings with the EU or facing prosecution by EU 
Member State authorities under EU Member State privacy laws. Self-certifying to the U.S.-EU Safe 
Harbor Framework will ensure that EU organizations know that your organization provides "adequate" 
privacy protection, as defined by the Directive. 
U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Benefits 
Benefits for participating U.S. organizations include: 
• 
All 27 EU Member States are bound by the European Commission’s finding of “adequacy” and 
Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway are bound by the European Economic Area (EEA)’s 
recognition of “adequacy”;

93 
 
• 
Organizations participating in the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor program will be deemed to provide 
“adequate” privacy protection;  
• 
Member State requirements for prior approval of data transfers either will be waived or approval 
will be automatically granted;  
• 
Claims brought by EU citizens against U.S. organizations will be heard, subject to limited 
exceptions, in the U.S.; and 
• 
Compliance requirements are streamlined and cost-effective, which should particularly benefit 
small and medium enterprises. 
An EU organization can ensure that it is sending information to a U.S. organization participating in the 
U.S.-EU Safe Harbor program by viewing the public list of Safe Harbor organizations posted on the Safe 
Harbor website. This list contains the names of all U.S. organizations that have self-certified to the U.S.-
EU Safe Harbor Framework. This list will be regularly updated, so that it is clear which organizations are 
assured of Safe Harbor benefits. 
 
Please note that an organization does not have to self-certify compliance with the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor 
Framework in order to self-certify compliance with the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework and vice versa. 
Although the respective sets of Safe Harbor Privacy Principles, frequently asked questions and answers 
(FAQs), and enforcement statements of the two Safe Harbor Frameworks are similar, they differ in a 
number of ways. Understanding the Safe Harbor Frameworks requires familiarity with all of the relevant 
documents.

Appendix F: Glossary* 
Access – The ability to view personal information held by an organization – this ability may be 
complemented by an ability to update or correct the information. Access defines the intersection of 
identity and data; that is, who can do what to which data. 
Adequacy – Adequacy refers to the recognition of the existence of a legal regime in another country that 
provides sufficient protection for personal information. The Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection (FADP) 
provides that “personal data may not be disclosed abroad if the privacy of the data subjects would be 
seriously endangered thereby, in particular due to the absence of legislation that guarantees adequate 
protection.” As used in the EU Data Protection Directive, a country will be deemed “adequate” if its laws 
afford individuals rights that are similar to those afforded by the EU Data Protection Directive. In the EU 
context, if a country offers adequate protection, then data transfers from the European Economic Area 
(EEA) to that country may occur without any further limitation – provided that the processing meets the 
other provisions of the EU Directive. The adequacy concept has been expanded to encompass other 
types of data transfer mechanisms. For example, the U.S.-Swiss and U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Frameworks 
provide an adequate level of protection, so companies that are in the relevant Safe Harbor may transfer 
data from Switzerland and/or the European Union to the United States. 
Choice – An individual’s ability to determine whether or how personal information collected from him or 
her may be used or disclosed by the entity that collected the information. Also: The ability of an individual 
to limit certain uses of his or her personal information. For example, an individual may have choice about 
whether to permit a company to contact the individual or share the individual’s data with third parties. 
Data commissioner◊ – Government official that runs a data protection office and that is charged with 
enforcing a country’s data protection laws. According to the FADP the Federal Data Protection and 
Information Commissioner (FDPIC) “fulfills his tasks independently without being subject to the Directives 
of any authority.” These tasks include supervising compliance by federal bodies with the FADP and other 
federal data protection regulations, advising private persons on data protection matters, and investigating 
and making recommendations regarding the private sector. As relates to the private sector, the FDPIC is 
authorized to investigate whether methods of processing are capable of breaching the privacy of large 
numbers of persons, data files must be registered or there is a duty to provide information.

On the basis of his investigations, the FDPIC may recommend that the method of processing be changed 
or abandoned. If the recommendation made by the FDPIC is not complied with or rejected, he may refer 
the matter to the Federal Administrative Court for a decision. Included in its list of tasks is the provision of 
its expert opinion on the extent to which foreign data protection legislation guarantees adequate 
protection. 
Data controller – A controller is any person who makes decisions with regard to the processing of 
personal data, including decisions about the purposes for which the personal data are processed and the 
manner in which the personal data are processed. The FADP defines a “controller of the data file” as: 
“private persons or federal bodies that decide on the purpose and content of a data file.” The EU Directive 
defines a data “controller” as: “the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or any other body 
which alone or jointly with others determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data; 
where the purposes and means of processing are determined by national or community laws or 
regulations, the controller or the specific criteria for his nomination may be designated by national or 
community law.” 
 
Data processor – A data processor is a person who processes the data on behalf of the data controller, 
but who is under the authority of the data controller. The EU Directive defines data “processor” as: “a 
natural or legal person, public authority, agency or any other body which processes personal data on 
behalf of the controller.” 
 
Data protection – The management of personal information. In the United States, “privacy” is the term 
that is used in policies, laws, and regulations. In contrast, in Switzerland, the European Union, and other 
countries, the term “data protection” often identifies privacy-related laws and regulations. 
 
Data protection authority – See also Data protection office, Data commissioner. 
Data protection office – A government agency that enforces data protection legislation. According to the 
EU Directive: “Each member state shall provide that one or more public authorities are responsible for 
monitoring the application within its territory of the provisions adopted by the member states pursuant to

Each authority has investigative powers necessary for the performance of its supervisory duties, power to 
engage in legal proceedings in case of violations. Each supervisory authority shall hear claims lodged by 
any person, or by an association representing that person.”  See also Data protection authority, Data 
commissioner. 
 
Data subject – Term used in some data protection litigation to describe an individual who is the subject 
of a personal data record. 
Deceptive trade practices – In the context of U.S. federal law, a term associated with corporate entities 
that mislead or misrepresent products or services to consumers and customers. These practices are 
regulated by the Federal Trade Commission at the federal level and typically by the Attorney General's 
Office of Consumer Protection at the state level. These laws typically provide both for enforcement by the 
government to stop the practice and individual actions for damages brought by consumers who are hurt 
by the practices. 
 
Dispute resolution – The response to a valid complaint or grievance, or the action taken to correct faulty 
information, or to make amends for harm or inconvenience caused to an individual. 
EU Data Protection Directive (EU Directive) – Several directives deal with personal data usage, but the 
most important is the general policy approved by the European Commission in 1995 (95/46/EC) which 
protects individuals’ privacy and personal data use. The EU Directive was adopted in 1995 and became 
effective in 1998. The EU Directive recognizes the European view that privacy is a fundamental human 
right, and establishes a general comprehensive legal framework that is aimed at protecting individuals 
and promoting individual choice regarding the processing of personal data. The EU Directive imposes an 
onerous set of requirements on any person that collects or processes data pertaining to individuals in 
their personal or professional capacity. It is based on a set of data protection principles, which include the 
legitimate basis, purpose limitation, data quality, proportionality, and transparency principles, data 
security and confidentiality, data subjects’ rights of access, rectification, deletion, and objection, 
restrictions on onwards transfers, additional protection where special categories of data and direct 
marketing are involved, and a prohibition on automated individual decisions. The EU Directive applies to 
all sectors of industry, from financial institutions to consumer goods companies, and from list brokers to 
any employer. The EU Directive’s key provisions impose serious restrictions on personal data processing, 
grant individual rights to “data subjects,” and set forth specific procedural obligations, including notification 
to national authority.

The EU Directive has been supplemented by additional directives, including a specific provision for the 
telecommunications sector (2002/58) as well as for e-commerce. 
European Economic Area (EEA)◊ – The EEA  allows Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway to participate 
in the EU's internal market without a conventional EU membership. These three countries apply EEA law, 
which is identical to all EU legislation related to the single market, with the exception of legislation on 
agriculture, fisheries, and fiscal issues. The EEA, however, is not a customs union. Switzerland is not a 
member of the EEA, but has concluded a large number of bilateral agreements with the EU covering a 
significant part of EEA law.  
European Union (EU) – The European Union is an organization of European countries dedicated to 
increasing economic integration and strengthening cooperation among its members. The European Union 
was involved in the development of the Safe Harbor Principles that affect data flows from the European 
Union into the United States. As of July 2008, the member states include: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, 
Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, 
Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, 
Spain, Sweden, and United Kingdom. 
Federal Trade Commission (FTC) – The U.S. Federal Trade Commission enforces a variety of federal 
antitrust and consumer protection laws, including the Safe Harbor Principles. The FTC seeks to ensure 
that the nation’s markets function competitively, and are vigorous, efficient, and free of undue restrictions. 
The FTC also works to enhance the smooth operation of the marketplace by eliminating acts or practices 
that are unfair or deceptive. 
Member state – In EU documents, this term refers to a country that is a full member of the European 
Union.  See European Union. 
Notice – A written description of an entity’s practices with respect to its collection, use and disclosure of 
personal information. A private notice typically includes a description of what personal information the 
entity collects, how the entity uses the information, with whom it shares the information, whether the 
information is secured, and whether an individual has any choices as to how the entity uses the 
information. 
Opt-in – A consumer’s expression of affirmative consent based upon a specific act of the consumer.

Opt-out – A consumer’s exercise of choice through an affirmative request that a particular use of 
disclosure of data not occur. 
Personal data – The FADP defines “personal data (data)” as: “all information relating to an identified or 
identifiable person.” The EU Directive defines “personal data” as: “any information relating to an identified 
or identifiable natural person ('data subject')” and explains that an “identifiable person” is “one who can be 
identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identification number or to one or more 
factors specific to his physical, physiological, mental, economic, cultural or social identity.” 
Personal information – Any information that (i) relates to an individual and (ii) identifies or can be used 
to identify the individual. Such information may include an individual’s name, postal address, e-mail 
address, telephone number, Social Security number, or other unique identifier. 
Privacy – The appropriate use of personal information under the circumstances. What is appropriate will 
depend on context, law, and the individual’s expectations; also, the right of an individual to control the 
collection, use, and disclosure of personal information. 
Privacy policy – An organization’s standard pertaining to the user information it collects and what is 
done with the information after it is collected. 
Privacy seal program – Self-regulatory regimes that certify compliance with a set of standards of privacy 
protection. Services provide a “trust” mark, as well as independent verification and remediation and 
dispute resolution mechanisms for online privacy practices. Websites display the program’s seal to 
indicate that they adhere to these standards. 
Privacy statement – An organization’s communication regarding its privacy policies, such as what 
personal information is collected, how it will be used, with whom it will be shared, and whether one has 
the option to exercise control over how one’s information is used. Privacy statements are frequently 
posted on websites. 
Processing of personal data – The FADP defines “processing” as: “any operation with personal data, 
irrespective of the means applied and the procedure, and in particular the collection, storage, use, 
revision, disclosure, archiving or destruction of data.”

The EU Directive defines “processing” as: “any operation or set of operations performed upon personal 
data, whether or not by automatic means, such as collection, recording, organization, storage, adaptation 
or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making 
available, alignment or combination, blocking, erasure, or destruction.” 
Safe Harbor – The EU Directive and the FADP prohibit the transfer of personal data outside of the 
European Union and Switzerland respectively, to jurisdictions that do not meet the European “adequacy” 
standard for privacy protection. While the United States, the European Union, and Switzerland share the 
goal of privacy protection, the United States uses a sectoral approach that relies on a mix of legislation, 
regulation, and self-regulation, while the European Union and Switzerland rely on comprehensive 
legislation that requires, among other things, the creation of government data protection agencies. As a 
result of these different approaches to privacy protection, the EU Directive and the FADP could have 
significantly hampered the ability of U.S. organizations to engage in many trans-Atlantic transactions. 
In order to bridge the differences in approach and provide a streamlined means for U.S. organizations to 
comply with the EU data protection requirements, the U.S. Department of Commerce and the European 
Commission developed a “Safe Harbor” framework. The U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework, which was 
approved by the EU in 2000, is an important way for U.S. organizations to avoid interruptions in business 
dealings with the EU. 
The U.S. Department of Commerce and the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner of 
Switzerland developed a separate “Safe Harbor” framework to bridge the differences in approach and 
provide a streamlined means for U.S. organizations to comply with Swiss data protection requirements.  
The U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework, which was approved in 2009, is an important way for U.S. 
organizations to avoid interruption in business dealings with Switzerland. 
Self-certifying compliance with one or both of the Safe Harbor Frameworks assures European 
organizations that an organization provides adequate privacy protection, as defined by the relevant data 
protection law. From a U.S. perspective, the Safe Harbor program is a self-regulatory regime that is only 
available to organizations that are subject to the enforcement authority of the U.S. Federal Trade 
Commission or the U.S. Department of Transportation. Organizations that are outside of the jurisdiction of 
these two agencies are not eligible to join Safe Harbor.

Sensitive personal data / sensitive information – The FADP and the EU Directive distinguish between 
ordinary personal data, such as name, address, and telephone number, and sensitive personal data, 
defined as racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious beliefs, trade union membership, health, sex 
life, and criminal convictions. The processing of such data is prohibited unless specifically allowed by law.  
Special restrictions apply to the processing of such data. 
Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection (FADP)◊ – The Federal Act on Data Protection (FADP) and the 
Swiss Federal Data Protection Ordinance entered into force in 1993. In 2006, revisions to the FADP and 
the federal decree were adopted requiring greater transparency in the processing of personal data.  In 
Switzerland, the right to privacy is guaranteed in article 13 of the Swiss Federal Constitution. The FADP 
recognizes the European view that privacy is a fundamental human right, and establishes a general 
comprehensive legal framework that is aimed at protecting individuals and promoting individual choice 
regarding the processing of personal data. The law is very wide in its scope and applies to personal data 
activities carried out by federal authorities, private organizations, and individual private persons 
(excluding those for normal private purposes). The FADP covers data relating to both private and legal 
persons and applies to electronic data processing, as well as manual files. The law is based on a set of 
data protection principles, which includes: legitimate basis and purpose limitation; data quality; 
transparency; data security; rights of access, rectification, and deletion; restrictions on onward transfers; 
and additional protection where special categories of data are involved. The FADP’s key provisions grant 
individual rights to “data subjects”, and set forth specific procedural obligations. Under the FADP, private 
persons are only required to register their data sets if they regularly process sensitive personal data or 
personality profiles or if they regularly disclose personal data to third parties, even if the data subjects 
concerned have been duly informed (certain derogations apply). Although it is no longer necessary to 
report the transfer of personal data outside of Switzerland, the transfer of such data abroad is only 
permissible if adequate data protection can be assured.
