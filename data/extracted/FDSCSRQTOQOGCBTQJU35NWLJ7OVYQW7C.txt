WASHINGTON, D.C. - Today, Congressman Chris Murphy (CT-5) announced a new feature on his web site, an Online
Tax Resource Center,�
to assist families in preparing their 2007 returns and in achieving all�
deductions, credits, and refunds that are owed to them.�
�
�
"The annual task of filing your taxes can be a time�
consuming process. The goal of my Online Tax Resource Center is to�
provide as much information as possible in one place so that you can�
take care of your taxes as quickly as possible," said Murphy.�
�
�
The Online Tax Resource Center includes information about:�
�
�
�
 -  The economic stimulus package recently signed into�
�law, which allows tax rebates of up to $600 per individual, up to�
�$1,200 per couple, plus $300 per child to be sent as early as mid-May.�
�
 -  Free tax preparation services. If your 2007�
�adjusted gross income was $54,000 or less, you can use Free File to�
�prepare and file your Federal Income Tax Return online. Other resources�
�available are the Tax Counseling for the Elderly program and the�
�Volunteer Income Tax Assistance program.�
�
 -  The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), which is a federal income tax credit for people who work but have low incomes.�
�
 -  The Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT). This tax was in�
�the news this year because Congress had to act to ensure that 23�
�million Americans, including more than 72,000 in Connecticut's Fifth�
�District, did not get hit with this tax that was originally intended�
�for wealthy families to pay their share of taxes.�
�
 -  How to track your refund.�
�
 -  The Taxpayer Advocate Service, which is an�
�independent organization inside the IRS. The purpose of the service is�
�to assist taxpayers who are facing economic harm or who have tax�
�problems that have not been resolved through normal channels.�
�
 -  Federal and state resources, and useful phone numbers.�
