Contracting officer’s decision. 
made until the matter is resolved, un-
less the Deputy Assistant Secretary for 
Acquisition and Materiel Management, 
Acquisition Resources Service, or the 
Chief Facilities Management Officer, 
Office of Facilities Management, as ap-
propriate, approves the head of con-
tracting activity findings required by 
FAR 33.104(b)(1) and GAO has been no-
tified pursuant to FAR 33.104(b)(2). 
(c) Protests after award. Protests after 
award shall be handled in a manner 
consistent with procedures identified 
for protests before award. Although 
persons involved or affected by the fil-
ing of a protest may be limited, at 
least the contractor shall be furnished 
the notice of the protest and its basis 
by the contracting officer. When VA re-
ceives from GAO, within ten calendar 
days after award, a notice of protest 
filed directly with GAO, and it is deter-
mined by the head of the contracting 
activity pursuant to FAR 33.104(c)(2) 
that contract performance should be 
authorized, the written findings will 
first be approved by the Deputy Assist-
ant Secretary for Acquisition and Ma-
teriel Management, Acquisition Re-
sources Service (or the Chief Facilities 
Management Officer, Office of Facili-
ties Management, as appropriate), and 
the GAO must be notified as required 
by FAR 33.104(c)(3).
