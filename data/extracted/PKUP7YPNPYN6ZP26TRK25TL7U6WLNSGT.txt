Clean Air Act Final Approval of
Operating Permits Program; State of
Rhode Island
AGENCY: Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA).
ACTION: Proposed rule.
Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), as
Amended by the Small Business
Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of
1996 (SBREFA), 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.
The RFA generally requires an agency
to prepare a regulatory flexibility
analysis of any rule subject to notice
and comment rulemaking requirements
under the Administrative Procedure Act
or any other statute unless the agency
certifies that the rule will not have a
significant economic impact on a
substantial number of small entities.
Small entities include small businesses,
small organizations, and small
governmental jurisdictions.
For purposes of assessing the impacts
of this proposed rule on small entities,
small entity is defined as (1) a small
business in the regulated industry
which has less than 750 employees; (2)
a small governmental jurisdiction that is
a government of a city, county, town,
school district or special district with a
population of less than 50,000; or (3) a
small organization that is any not-for-
profit enterprise that is independently
owned and operated and is not
dominant in its field.
After considering the economic
impacts of this proposed rule on small
entities, I certify that this action will not
have a significant economic impact on
a substantial number of small entities.
This proposed rule will not impose any
requirements on small entities because
SUMMARY: The EPA is proposing to
approve the Texas Plan for Designated
Facilities and Pollutants (111(d) Plan)
submitted by the Governor of Texas on
June 2, 2000, to implement and enforce
the emissions guidelines for existing
hospital/medical/ infectious waste
incinerators (HMIWI).
In the ‘‘Rules and Regulations’’
section of this Federal Register, EPA is
approving the State’s HMIWI 111(d)
Plan as a direct final rule without prior
proposal because EPA views this as a
noncontroversial revision and
anticipates no adverse comment. The
EPA has explained its reasons for this
approval in the preamble to the direct
final rule. If EPA receives no relevant
adverse comment, EPA will not take
further action on this proposed rule. If
EPA receives relevant adverse comment,
EPA will withdraw the direct final rule
and it will not take effect. The EPA will
address all public comments in a
subsequent final rule based on this
proposed rule. The EPA will not
institute a second comment period on

the operating permit program submitted
