Study site name:  Thompson Basin .  
Vegetation type:  Juniper-Pinyon .
Compass bearing:  frequency baseline 155 degrees magnetic. (Lines 2 & 3 155Â°M)

LOCATION DESCRIPTION
From the Monroe City cemetery, go 3.05 miles north and east to a gravel road on the right.  Turn here and go
1.0 miles to the Thompson Basin Road.  Turn right and proceed 1.9 miles to a cattleguard.  Continue 1.0 mile
up the road and stop.  There is a witness post on the right side of the road.  Fifty feet up the hill, there should
be a juniper with the center trunk cut out.  The 0-foot baseline stake is on the other side of this tree,
approximately 60 feet from the road.  The 0-foot stake is a 3/4" rebar tagged #7041.

DISCUSSION
Thompson Basin - Trend Study No. 23-3
Study Information
This study is located on a moderately steep slope above Thompson Basin [elevation: 6,880 feet (2,097 m),
slope: 25%, aspect: northeast].  An area below the transect was chained approximately 25 years ago by the US
Forest Service.  A fire also burned through the area approximately 30 years ago.  Thompson Basin has been
noted historically as a concentration area for deer during the winter.  A DWR pellet group transect, which
intersects the trend study, indicated a 5-year average of 32 deer days use/acre (80 ddu/ha) between 1980 and
1985 (Jense et al. 1985).  The 6-year average from 1986 to 1991 was 9 deer days use/acre (21 ddu/ha) (Jense et
al. 1991).  A pellet group transect sampled along the study baseline estimated deer use at 21 days use/acre (52
ddu/ha) in 1998, 26 days use/acre (65 ddu/ha) in 2003, and 20 days use/acre (50 ddu/ha) in 2008.  Elk use was
estimated at 12 days use/acre (30 edu/ha) in 1998, 9 days use/acre (23 edu/ha) in 2003, and 15 days use/acre
(38 edu/ha) in 2008.  Cattle use was estimated at 1 day use/acre (2 cdu/ha) in 2008.  In the past, the area was
heavily grazed by sheep, however, the Forest Service has closed the area to livestock grazing to protect
watershed values.
Soil
The soil is a sandy clay loam with a neutral reaction (pH 6.6).  Relative combined vegetation and litter cover
decreased from 62% in 1998 to 49% in 2003 and 2008, while relative combined rock and pavement cover
remained rather stable at 31%-36%.  Relative bare ground cover increased from 7% in 1998 to 19% by 2008. 
The erosion condition class was rated as stable in 2003 and moderate in 2008 due to surface rock, litter, and
soil movement, as well as the formation of pedestals and flow patterns.  There are a few large, active gullies on
the hillside and in the valley.  
Browse
Mountain big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata ssp. vaseyana) is the only abundant source of preferred browse,
although true mountain mahogany (Cercocarpus montanus) and Mormon tea (Ephedra viridis) are present in
low densities.  Sagebrush quadrat cover has remained stable at 4%-5% since 1998.  Density decreased from
1,000 plants/acre in 1998 and 2003 to 840 plants/acre in 2008.  Decadence has been high in all sample years at
30%-55% of the population.  Young recruitment increased slightly from less than 10% of the population
before 2003 to 14% in 2008.  Plants displaying poor vigor increased from 0% of the population in 1985 to
32% in 1991, decreased to 10% in 1998, then increased to 29% by 2008.  Browse use has been mostly light-
moderate in all sample years.  Annual leader growth averaged 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) in 2003 and 0.7 inches (1.9
cm) in 2008.  
Pinyon pine (Pinus edulis) and Utah juniper (Juniperus osteosperma) combined canopy cover was 23% in
1998, 34% in 2003, and 27% in 2008.  Point-centered quarter data estimated pinyon density at 72 trees/acre in
1998 and 63 trees/acre in 2003 and 2008.  Average trunk diameter was 4.2 inches (10.7 cm) in 1998 and
approximately 5 inches (12.7 cm) in 2003 and 2008.  Juniper density was 99 trees/acre in 1998, 97 trees/acre
in 2003, and 104 trees/acre in 2008.  Trunk diameter averaged 9.9 inches (25.1 cm) in 1998, 8.4 inches (21.4
cm) in 2003, and 9.6 inches (24.3 cm) in 2008.
Herbaceous Understory
Total grass cover was 12% in 1998, 6% in 2003, and 7% in 2008.  Perennial grasses dominate the understory. 
Bluebunch wheatgrass (Agropyron spicatum), mutton bluegrass (Poa fendleriana), and Sandberg bluegrass
(Poa secunda) combined provided 94%-98% of the total grass cover since 1998.  Bottlebrush squirreltail
(Sitanion hystrix) and Indian ricegrass (Oryzopsis hymenoides) were also present but less frequent.  Cheatgrass
(Bromus tectorum) was sampled in less than 25% of the quadrats since 1998, and provided little cover.
329
Forbs are sparse and provided 1%-3% cover since 1998.  Desert phlox (Phlox austromontana) provided the
majority of the forb cover.  Longleaf phlox (Phlox longifolia), rockcress (Arabis sp.), and tansymustard
(Descurainia pinnata) were also relatively abundant.
1991 TREND ASSESSMENT
The browse trend is slightly down.  Sagebrush density decreased from 1,599 plants/acre to 1,466 plants/acre,
and decadence increased from 33% of the population to 55%.  Young recruitment remained stable at 9% of the
population.  Plants exhibiting poor vigor increased from 0% of the population to 32%.  The trend for grass is
up.  The sum of nested frequency for perennial grasses increased substantially.  Bluebunch wheatgrass,
Sandberg bluegrass, mutton bluegrass, and bottlebrush squirreltail increased significantly in nested frequency. 
The trend for forbs is up.  The sum of nested frequency for perennial forbs greatly increased.  Desert phlox
increased significantly in nested frequency.
browse - slightly down (-1)
grass - up (+2)
forb - up (+2)
1998 TREND ASSESSMENT
The browse trend is stable.  Browse density changes may have been related to the larger sample area in 1998,
therefore, the trend was determined using other parameters.  Sagebrush decadence remained high, although it
decreased from 55% of the population to 30%.  Young recruitment decreased slightly from 9% of the
population to 6%.  Plants displaying poor vigor decreased from 32% of the population to 10%.  The trend for
grass is down.  The sum of nested frequency for perennial grasses decreased 27%.  Bluebunch wheatgrass,
Sandberg bluegrass, and bottlebrush squirreltail decreased significantly in nested frequency.  The trend for
forbs is down.  The sum of nested frequency for perennial forbs decreased 52%.  Longleaf phlox decreased
significantly in nested frequency.  The winter range condition, determined by the Desirable Components Index
(DCI), was rated as very poor due to low preferred browse and perennial forb cover, despite moderate
perennial grass cover.
winter range condition (DCI) - very poor (31) Mid-level potential scale
browse - stable (0)
grass - down (-2)
forb - down (-2)
2003 TREND ASSESSMENT
The browse trend is stable.  Sagebrush density remained similar to 1998 at 1,000 plants/acre.  However,
decadence increased from 30% of the population to 42%.  Young recruitment also slightly increased from 6%
of the population to 10%.  Plants displaying poor vigor increased from 10% of the population to 24%.  The
trend for grass is slightly down.  The sum of nested frequency for perennial grasses decreased 17%.  Mutton
bluegrass decreased significantly in nested frequency, and that for Sandberg bluegrass increased significantly. 
The trend for forbs is stable.  The sum of nested frequency for perennial forbs increased slightly.  The DCI
rating remained very poor.
winter range condition (DCI) - very poor (20) Mid-level potential scale
browse - stable (0)
grass - slightly down (-1)
forb - stable (0)
2008 TREND ASSESSMENT
The browse trend is slightly down.  Sagebrush density decreased 16%, and decadence remained high at 40% of
the population.  Young recruitment increased slightly from 10% of the population to 14%.  Plants displaying
poor vigor continued to increase, from 24% of the population to 29%.  The trend for grass is stable.  The sum
of nested frequency for perennial grasses changed little.  Mutton bluegrass increased significantly in nested
frequency, while that for Sandberg bluegrass decreased significantly.  The trend for forbs is stable.  The sum
of nested frequency for perennial forbs decreased slightly.  Tansymustard decreased significantly in nested
frequency.  The DCI rating remained very poor.
