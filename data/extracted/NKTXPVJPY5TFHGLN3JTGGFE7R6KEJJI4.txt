BUDGET REDUCTION (Negative Supplemental):  S1194 reduced the fiscal year 2003 General Fund appropriation for this agency by 3.5%.
APPROPRIATION HIGHLIGHTS:   H462 funded personnel cost rollups for this and other selected agencies.  No inflationary increases 
were funded.  No funding for Change in Employee Compensation (CEC) was provided, but compensation increases may be funded with 
agency salary savings wherever possible.  Nonstandard Adjustments reflect changes in Attorney General, Controller and Treasurer fees.
OTHER LEGISLATION:  H87 transferred the Idaho Commission on the Arts from the Secretary of State to the Office of the Governor 
beginning July 1, 2003 (FY 2004).
