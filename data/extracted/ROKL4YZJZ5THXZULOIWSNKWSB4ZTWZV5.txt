Some Pig 
spin round webs in the fields and gardens.  
There’s no need to fear them, they’re
harmless to people and will help control
pests in the garden. To find out more about  
spiders, join us on a Spider Search on

in her.
All kids seem to love Charlotte’s
Web, the classic children’s story by E. B.
White, of Wilbur the pig and his faithful
friend Charlotte the spider. Even kids who
haven’t read the book have seen the movie

resourceful. To save Wilbur from his fate as
bacon, she spins the immortal words “Some
Pig” with webbing over his sty, and
eventually makes him the world’s most
famous farm animal.

common enough in agricultural fields that
they seriously reduce the numbers of insect
pests. The financial benefit of spiders to pest
control is estimated at over one million
dollars per year in New York State alone.
Spiders eat insects–they’re not looking for
humans to bite. Dangerously venomous
spiders are rare in New York State; few of
us will ever even see one.
August is the month of orb weavers,
