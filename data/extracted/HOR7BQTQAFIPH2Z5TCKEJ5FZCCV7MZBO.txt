John Barrow
BARROW TO VISIT WITH HOLIDAY CARD ART CONTEST WINNER
�
Tomorrow, December 17, at 11:00 a.m., Congressman John Barrow�
(GA-12) will be at Collins Elementary School in Augusta to congratulate the winner of his�
Holiday Card Art Contest, Teia Patrick, a 5th Grader at Collins.  He will present her with a framed copy of the�
card she designed as well as an official 2008 Congressional ornament.�
�
�
More than 500 students from over 100 12th District schools submitted their artwork to be used�
as the cover for Congressman Barrow's 2008 Holiday Card.  The theme for the contest was "Holidays in�
the 12th District."�
Students from kindergarten to 5th Grade were asked to�
participate.  Although all of the�
drawings and designs were wonderful, Teia Patrick's artwork was chosen from all�
of the submissions as the very best.  It�
is now the cover of Congressman Barrow's card for this year.  On the back of the card is a photo of Teia�
and Congressman Barrow.�
�
�
"Teia's card really represented what the holidays mean to�
folks in the 12th District,"�
said Barrow.  "Being at home with your�
family and enjoying time together is really what the holidays are all about."�
�
�
An electronic copy of Congressman Barrow's 2008 Holiday Card�
featuring Teia Patrick's design is attached to this advisory.�
