sub-shell. As shown in Fig. 10.1, according to this
deﬁnition transition metals occur in Groups 1B and
3B-8B of the periodic table, and the transition metals
across the periodic table have progressively increasing
d-shell electron occupancy up to a maximum of 9.
A characteristic of transition metals is that they gener-
ally exhibit two or more oxidation states, which as a
consequence often leads to differences in the stable
isotope composition of the chemical compounds and
aqueous species they form. Transition metals for
which signiﬁcant variation of stable isotope com-
position in natural materials has been demonstrated
include chromium (Cr), iron (Fe), nickel (Ni), copper
(Cu), molybdenum (Mo) and silver (Ag).
The above deﬁnition of transition metal speciﬁ-
Abstract The transition and post-transition metals,
which include the elements in Groups 3–12 of the
Periodic Table, have a broad range of geological and
biological roles as well as industrial applications and
thus are widespread in the environment. Interdiscip-
linary research over the past decade has resulted in a
broad understanding of the isotope systematics of this
important group of elements and revealed largely
unexpected variability in isotope composition for
natural materials. Signiﬁcant kinetic and equilibrium
isotope fractionation has been observed for redox sen-
sitive metals such as iron, chromium, copper, molyb-
denum and mercury, and for metals that are not redox
sensitive in nature such as cadmium and zinc. In the
environmental sciences, the isotopes are increasingly
being used to understand important issues such as
tracing of metal contaminant sources and fates, unra-
veling metal redox cycles, deciphering metal nutrient
pathways and cycles, and developing isotope biosigna-
tures that can indicate the role of biological activity in
ancient and modern planetary systems.
10.1 Introduction
cally excludes the Group 2B elements zinc (Zn),
cadmium (Cd) and mercury (Hg), which are often
referred to as post-transition metals. These metals
have the d shell ﬁlled and thus generally occur as
cations only in the þ2 oxidation state. However, it is
useful to include the post-transition metals in any
discussion of transition metals, as they provide inter-
esting similarities and contrasts in chemical behavior,
are subject to change in redox state either naturally
(e.g. Hg) or under anthropogenic inﬂuence (e.g. Zn,
Cd) and display signiﬁcant variation of stable isotope
composition in natural materials.
Given this broad perspective, a description of the
The transition metals form a geochemically and isoto-
pically complex and interesting group of elements
clustered in the center of the periodic table. The term
transition metal, according to the International Union
of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), refers to an
element whose atom has an incomplete d sub-shell or
which can give rise to cations with an incomplete d

isotope systematics of the transition and post-transition
metals is given here, including general isotopic distri-
bution, examples of processes leading to stable isotope
fractionation, and chemical properties pertinent to the
discussion of stable isotope variability observed in
natural materials. Rather than providing a comprehen-
sive treatment of these issues, the intent here is to
provide a general understanding of how the transition
metal stable isotopes behave in Earth’s hydrosphere

research. Familiarity with the material in this section
will help readers who are not well versed in stable
isotope geochemistry to better appreciate the speciﬁc
applications discussed in the later part of the chapter.
10.1.1 Chromium (Cr)
2000; Johnson 2011) and mercury (Bergquist and
Blum 2009; Blum 2011). While oxidation of Cr(III)
to Cr(VI) is also likely to cause stable isotope fraction-
ation (Schauble 2004), this phenomenon has yet to be
rigorously demonstrated. Sorption of chromate and
bichromate on Fe- and Al-oxyhydroxides has only a
negligible instantaneous effect on the distribution of Cr
isotopes, with preferential partitioning of light Cr iso-
topes onto sorption sites. Sorption effects may be mag-
niﬁed at reaction fronts such as the leading edge of a Cr
contaminant plume in groundwater (Ellis et al. 2004).
10.1.2 Iron (Fe)
Chromium is an important trace element, particularly
in ultramaﬁc and maﬁc rock minerals, and is a major
element in several minerals such as chromite (FeCr2O4)
of the spinel group, uvarovite (Ca3Cr2(SiO4)3 of
the garnet group, and crocoite (PbCrO4). Chromium
has numerous industrial applications, including use in
electroplating, in leather tanning, as pigment in paint,
and as an anticorrosion agent. Chromium is stable
at the Earth’s surface in two oxidation states: Cr6+
2-)
(Cr(VI)), commonly referred to as hexavalent Cr,
and Cr3+ (Cr(III)), commonly referred to as trivalent
Cr. Cr(VI) is a strong oxidant, and occurs mainly as
the toxic, water-soluble oxyanions chromate (CrO4
1-). Cr(III) is nontoxic and is
and bichromate (HCr2O7
insoluble in water.
Chromium has four stable isotopes: 50Cr (4.35%),
Iron is the most abundant element on Earth and the
fourth most abundant element in the Earth’s crust. Iron
is the most widely used metal in industry, and thus is
pervasive in the environment. Iron is stable at the
Earth’s surface in two oxidation states: Fe2+ (Fe(II)),
commonly referred to as ferrous Fe, and Fe3+ (Fe(III)),
commonly referred to as ferric Fe. Fe(II) is a strong
reductant, is water-soluble, and is an important con-
stituent of Fe minerals formed under reducing condi-
tions (e.g. magnetite, siderite, pyrite). Fe(III) is only
sparingly water-soluble and is an important constitu-
ent of Fe minerals formed under oxidizing conditions
(e.g. ferrihydrite, goethite, hematite). Iron metal has
a wide variety of applications in metallurgy such as
construction of automobiles and ships, structural com-
ponents of buildings, and machinery in general. Iron
compounds such as Fe(III)-chloride and Fe(II)-sulfate
are likewise widely used in industry for a variety of
purposes. Iron plays an important role in biology and
is an essential nutrient for nearly all living organisms.
For example, Fe combines with oxygen to form hemo-
globin and myoglobin, the two main oxygen transport
proteins in vertebrates. Iron can serve as both electron
donor and electron acceptor for a wide range of micro-
organisms, and thus Fe redox reactions have the poten-
tial to support substantial microbial populations in soil
and sedimentary environments (Weber et al. 2006).
Iron has been viewed as a limiting nutrient for phyto-
plankton growth in the oceans (Martin and Fitzwater
1988). Iron transformations and cycling processes are
critical determinants of plant, forest and agricultural
ecosystem function. Iron itself is generally non-toxic,
but dissolved Fe(II) does impart an unpleasant taste to
52Cr (83.79%), 53Cr (9.50%) and 54Cr (2.37%); note
that for Cr and other elements discussed below that
relative percentages of the isotopes are the values
recommended by IUPAC to represent average terres-
trial abundances. Igneous rocks have a very restricted
range of 53Cr/52Cr which on average is about 0.12‰
(parts per thousand) less than that of NIST (National
Institute of Standards and Technology) 979 Cr metal
(Schoenberg et al. 2008). Presently the measured
range of 53Cr/52Cr in natural materials is ~6‰, essen-
tially reﬂecting the range measured for naturally occu-
rring Cr(VI) in groundwater (Izbicki et al. 2008). Both
inorganic and microbially mediated reduction of Cr
(VI) to Cr(III) have been shown to result in isotope
fractionation, with breakage of the strong Cr-O bond
in chromate and bichromate appearing to be the rate
limiting step (Ellis et al. 2002; Sikora et al. 2008).
During reduction of Cr(VI), the product Cr(III) formed
at any step of the process is 3–4‰ lighter than co-
existing remnant Cr(VI). The fact that the oxidized
species, Cr(VI), is heavier than the reduced species,
Cr(III), is consistent with observations for other redox-
sensitive elements such as selenium (Johnson et al.

a nuisance.
a lithologic baseline for comparison of this potential
biomarker of methanogenesis.
Like Cr, Fe has four stable isotopes: 54Fe (5.58%),
10.1.4 Copper (Cu)
Copper has a wide range of industrial applications,
including use for electrical wires, in metal alloys, in
boat paint to prevent biologic fouling, in water and gas
supply pipes, and in coins. Copper is stable at the
Earth’s surface in two oxidation states: Cu1+ (Cu(I)),
which is the common form in sulﬁde minerals such
as chalcopyrite (CuFeS2), chalcocite (Cu2S), and
enargite (Cu3AsS4); and Cu2+ (Cu(II)), which is the
common form in aqueous solution. Copper can be
toxic to animals, due in large part to its ability to
accept and donate single electrons readily as it
changes between oxidation states. This is thought to
catalyze the production of reactive radical ions leading
to the condition known as oxidative stress.
Cu has two stable isotopes: 63Cu (69.17%) and
56Fe (91.95%), 57Fe (2.18%) and 58Fe (0.30%). Igne-
ous rocks have a very restricted range of 56Fe/54Fe.
Presently the measured range of 56Fe/54Fe in natural
materials is ~5‰, with pyrites from Precambrian
black shales spanning this range (�3.6 to +1.2‰ rela-
tive to igneous rocks; Severmann and Anbar 2009).
Both inorganic and microbially-mediated oxidation of
Fe(II) to Fe(III) and microbial reduction of Fe(III) to
Fe(II) have been shown to result in stable isotope
fractionation (Bullen et al. 2001; Balci et al. 2006;
Beard et al. 1999). Perhaps most important in this
regard is the experimentally and theoretically well-
established isotope exchange equilibrium between Fe
(II)- and Fe(III)-hexaquo complexes of ~3‰ (Johnson
et al. 2002; Anbar et al. 2005), in which the oxidized
species, Fe(III), is heavier than the reduced species,
Fe(II), as is the case for Cr. In addition, an important
role for sorption of Fe onto mineral surfaces has been
recognized, with heavy Fe species observed to popu-
late the sorption sites after equilibrium is attained
(Beard et al. 2010).
10.1.3 Nickel (Ni)
65Cu (30.83%). In natural materials, the measured
range of 65Cu/63Cu is approximately 9‰ for solid
samples and 3‰ for water samples (Larson et al.
2003; Borrok et al. 2008). In one study of possible
Cu stable isotope fractionation processes, abiotic
oxidative dissolution of Cu-bearing sulﬁde minerals
resulted in the product aqueous Cu(II) being ~1.4‰
heavier in terms of the 65Cu/63Cu ratio than Cu in
chalcopyrite and ~3.0‰ heavier than Cu in chalcocite.
Involving the microbe Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans
in the dissolution process reduced the fractionation
observed in both cases (Mathur et al. 2005).
Copper isotopes are beginning to provide important
Nickel is used in many industrial and consumer
products, including stainless steel and other metal
alloys, coins, rechargeable batteries, and electroplat-
ing. Nickel is an important trace element in ultramaﬁc
and maﬁc rocks. Nickel is stable at the Earth’s surface
in three oxidation states: primarily as Ni2+ (Ni(II)),
but also as Ni1+ (Ni(I)) and Ni3+ (Ni(III)). Nickel is
an important enzyme cofactor, for example in urease,
which assists in the hydrolysis of urea.
Nickel has ﬁve stable isotopes: 58Ni (68.1%), 60Ni
(26.2%), 61Ni (1.1%), 62Ni (3.6%) and 64Ni (0.9%).
In a recent study of Ni stable isotope variations related
to methanogenesis, Cameron et al. (2009) found that
methanogens cultured in the laboratory preferentially
assimilated light Ni from the media, leaving the resi-
due enriched in heavy Ni isotopes. Fractionation of
as much as 1.6‰ for 60Ni/58Ni was observed. In
contrast, little variability was observed among mete-
orites, basalts and continental sediments, suggesting
new insights into how Cu behaves in Earth’s rivers and
oceans, as well as how the isotopes may be fractio-
nated. Vance et al. (2008) reported 65Cu/63Cu ratios
for riverine water, estuarine water and particulates,
and open ocean water samples. They observed that
dissolved Cu in rivers had 65Cu/63Cu of from 0.02 to
1.45‰ greater than that of the NIST 976 Cu standard,
and for the most part greater than that of Cu in crustal
rocks (+0.16‰ relative to NIST 976). In the estuarine
samples, 65Cu/63Cu of dissolved Cu was 0.8–1.5‰
greater than that of Cu associated with particulate
material. Vance et al. (2008) interpreted this isotopic
contrast to reﬂect isotopic partitioning of the weath-
ered pool of Cu between a light fraction adsorbed to

particulates and a heavy dissolved fraction dominated
by Cu bound to strong organic complexes, providing
a mechanism to deliver heavy dissolved Cu to the
oceans. Dissolved Cu in open ocean water samples
was even heavier than that in the river waters, suggest-
ing a continuation of the fractionation between dis-
solved and particulate Cu fractions particularly in the
surface ocean.
that Zn adsorption due to complexation by organic
compounds is selective for the heavy Zn isotopes,
resulting for example in peat samples that have
heavier Zn isotope compositions than any potential
natural source. On the other hand, Borrok et al.
(2008) pointed out that Zn uptake by microorganisms
is selective for the light Zn isotopes. Thus there
are several fractionation processes for Zn that might
modify its isotope composition in the environment.
10.1.5 Zinc (Zn)
10.1.6 Molybdenum (Mo)
The post-transition metal Zn is used in electroplating,
metal alloys, pigment in paint, agricultural fertilizers
and pesticides, galvanized rooﬁng material, and
television-screen phosphors. Zinc is stable at the
Earth’s surface in one oxidation state, Zn2+ (Zn(II)).
The large pool of Zn0 metal produced industrially is
manufactured speciﬁcally for purposes that take
advantage of its high oxidation potential relative to
other metals (e.g. as an anti-fouling and anti-corrosive
agent on the submerged portion of ship hulls and
propeller shafts). Zinc is an important enzyme
cofactor, for example in alcohol dehydrogenase in
humans, and is generally thought to be non-toxic.
Zinc has ﬁve stable isotopes: 64Zn (48.63%), 66Zn
2-). Molybdates bear structural
Molybdenum is used in the production of high-
strength steel alloys, as pigments and catalysts, and
in a variety of high temperature applications such as
lubricants, electrical contacts and industrial motors.
Molybdenum is stable at the Earth’s surface in several
oxidation states, the most stable being Mo4+ (Mo(IV))
and Mo6+ (Mo(VI)). Molybdenum is an essential
enzyme cofactor in nearly all organisms, with particu-
lar importance for nitrogen ﬁxation, nitrate reduc-
tion and sulﬁte oxidation. Molybdenum is soluble in
strongly alkaline water such as seawater, forming

similarities to chromates, yet are weaker oxidants. In
fact, although Mo lies directly below Cr in the periodic
table, Mo compounds show more similarity to those of
tungsten (W), which lies directly below Mo in the
periodic table.
Molybdenum
has
seven
stable
isotopes:
92Mo (14.84%), 94Mo (9.25%), 95Mo (15.92%), 96Mo
(16.68%),
97Mo
(9.55%),
98Mo
(24.13%)
and
100Mo (9.63%). In natural materials, the measured
range of
97Mo/95Mo is ~3‰, with pelagic clays
(0.62%). In natural materials, the measured range of
66Zn/64Zn is approximately 2‰ (Cloquet et al. 2008).
Mare´chal et al. (1999) published the ﬁrst high-quality
measurements of zinc and copper isotope composi-
tions in a variety of minerals and biological materials.
Since this pioneering work the ﬁeld of Zn isotope
biogeochemistry has rapidly expanded into a variety
of environmental applications. For example, Zn has a
relatively low boiling point (~910�C) compared with
that of Cr or Cu, within the operating temperature
range of ore smelters. Thus Zn can evaporate from
ore during smelting, which would favor escape of light
Zn isotopes in the exhaust as demonstrated by
Mattielli et al. (2009), and retention of heavy Zn iso-
topes in the slag residue as shown by Sivry et al.
(2009). Kavner et al. (2008) demonstrated that elec-
troplated Zn, reduced to metallic state from a large
pool of aqueous Zn(II), is isotopically light compared
to the parent solution, potentially resulting in a large
pool of isotopically light electroplated Zn in the envi-
ronment. In addition, Weiss et al. (2007) demonstrated
extending to �1‰ and suboxic sediment pore ﬂuids
extending to þ2‰ relative to a modeled “bulk earth”
composition as deﬁned by Mo ores (Barling et al.
2001; Siebert et al. 2003; Anbar 2004; Arnold et al.
2004). Molybdenum isotopes are fractionated during
adsorption to ferromanganese oxides in oxidizing
environments (Barling et al. 2001; Barling and Anbar
2004) and precipitation of Fe-Mo-S solids in reducing
environments (Poulson et al. 2006; Neubert et al.
2008), and the extent of fractionation differs in these
two extreme conditions. Thus Mo isotopes can provide
information about local redox conditions.

10.1.7 Cadmium (Cd)
extremely toxic and can be readily ingested through
inhalation or absorption through the skin and mucous
membranes.
Mercury has seven stable isotopes: 196Hg (0.15%),
198Hg (9.97%),
199Hg (16.87%),
200Hg (23.10%),
The post-transition metal Cd is used primarily in
Ni-Cd batteries, metal alloys, electroplating, pigment
in paint, and electronic components. Cadmium is stable
at the Earth’s surface primarily in the Cd2+ (Cd(II))
oxidation state. Cadmium has a strong geological
afﬁnity to Zn, but unlike Zn can be toxic to humans
due to its effective substitution for calcium in bone and
its tendency to concentrate in the kidneys and liver
where it may become carcinogenic.
Cadmium has eight stable isotopes: 106Cd (1.25%),
108Cd (0.89%),
110Cd (12.49%),
111Cd (12.80%),
112Cd (24.13%),
113Cd (12.22%),
114Cd (28.73%)
and
116Cd (7.49%). In terrestrial materials, the
measured range of
114Cd/110Cd is approximately
201Hg (13.18%) 202Hg (29.86%) and 204Hg (6.87%).
Based on the compilation of existing high-precision
Hg isotope data reported by Bergquist and Blum
(2009), the measured range of 202Hg/198Hg in natural
materials resulting from mass dependent fractionation
(MDF) between coexisting Hg pools is approximately
7‰. This is remarkable, considering that measurable
fractionation of Hg isotopes was generally thought to
be non-existent as late as the 1990s. In addition, Hg
stable isotopes exhibit considerable mass independent
fractionation (MIF), in which the odd-numbered
isotopes 199Hg and 201Hg behave differently than the
even-numbered isotopes in certain chemical reactions
such as photochemical reduction (Bergquist and Blum
2007), leading to signiﬁcant enrichments and deple-
tions of the odd-numbered isotopes relative to the
even-numbered isotopes in environmental Hg pools.
Although Hg is included in the discussion here,
0.5‰; considering anthropogenically inﬂuenced mate-
rials extends that range to ~1.5‰ (Ripperger and
Rehk€amper 2007; Schmitt et al. 2009a, b; Shiel et al.
2010). Cadmium has an even lower boiling point
(~760�C) than Zn, and like Zn, Cd in ores likely
evaporates during smelting favoring escape of light
Cd isotopes in the exhaust, as recently demonstrated
by Cloquet et al. (2006a). Cadmium behaves like Zn
during electroplating (Kavner et al. 2008), potentially
resulting in a large pool of isotopically light Cd in the
environment. Although Cd is discussed in this chapter
mainly in a multi-tracer context, Rehk€amper et al.
(2011) provide a thorough discussion of the applica-
tion of Cd isotopes in environmental studies.
10.1.8 Mercury (Hg)
Blum (2011) provides a thorough discussion of the
theory and application of Hg isotopes in environmen-
tal studies. In his chapter, Blum (2011) points out that
most environmental applications of Hg isotopes are
concerned with either (1) interpreting the isotopic
composition of MeHg occurring in sediments and
organisms, or (2) interpreting the isotopic composition
of Hg(II) associated with sediments or deposited onto
the land surface or into a water body. In addition, the
author stresses the importance of redox reactions as
the main cause of isotope fractionation in the Hg
system and the role that the isotopes can play in
helping to increase our understanding of the chemical
bonding environments that lead to various Hg frac-
tions in sediments and other natural materials.
The post-transition metal Hg is used in thermometers
and other scientiﬁc apparatus, amalgam for dental
restoration, Hg vapor lamps, cosmetics, and liquid
mirror telescopes. Historically, Hg has been widely
used in gold mining operations. Mercury is stable at
the Earth’s surface as soluble Hg2+ (Hg(II)) and as Hg+

(Hg(I)) in the form of monomethylmercury (CH3Hg+).
In addition, and unlike the other transition and post-
transition metals, Hg has a stable gaseous form (Hg0)
at environmental temperatures with a residence time in
the atmosphere of approximately 1 year (Schroeder
and Munthe 1998). Mercury and its compounds (e.g.
monomethylmercury (MeHg), mercuric chloride) are

more than one stable isotope and thus the potential to have
variability of stable isotope composition in natural materials,
but such variability has yet to be rigorously demonstrated. Ele-
ments with red borders have only one stable isotope (no stable
isotope in the case of Tc)
Fig. 10.1 A portion of the Periodic Table of the Elements,
showing the transition and post-transition metals. Elements
with green borders are those for which signiﬁcant variability
of stable isotope composition has been observed in natural
materials. Elements with blue borders are those that have
in a wide variety of Ag-containing compounds and
minerals. Silver has two stable isotopes:
107Ag
(51.84%) and 109Ag (48.16%). In an initial study of
Ag stable isotope variation in sediment and domestic
and industrial sludge samples, Luo et al. (2010)
reported a small but signiﬁcant range of variation in
109Ag/107Ag of 0.1‰ that bracketed the value for their
standard. They found a different value for Ag from a
ﬁsh liver (+0.28‰ relative to their standard) that may
indicate a biological inﬂuence. However, at this stage
Ag is only beginning to be explored in terms of stable
isotope variability.
Tungsten provides an especially intriguing but
nature, but which have yet to be rigorously explored in
terms of isotope systematics. Examples of these ele-
ments that would be especially useful in environmen-
tal studies are titanium (Ti), vanadium (V), silver
(Ag), tungsten (W) and rhenium (Re). For example,
as pointed out by Severman and Anbar (2009), Re
(185Re (37.4%), 187Re (62.6%); common oxidation
states Re2+, Re4+, Re6+, Re7+) is removed from solu-
tion into sediments only under anoxic or suboxic con-
ditions, making it a suitable tracer for moderately
reducing conditions. In contrast, V (50V (0.25%), 51V
(99.75%); common oxidation states V2+, V3+, V4+, V5+)
is scavenged from solution by manganese oxides and
Fe-oxyhydroxides, making it a suitable tracer for oxic
conditions. Both potential redox-tracing applications
assume that sedimentation promotes isotope fraction-
ation between sediment and residual aqueous pools of
Re or V, but such fractionation has yet to be demon-
strated.
Silver, in addition to its historic value as a precious
as yet untested candidate for stable isotope variation
in natural materials at the Earth’s surface. Tungsten
is used in many high-temperature applications, such as
light bulbs and welding processes, and in lubricants,
abrasives, ceramic glazes, and heavy metal alloys. The
most common oxidation state of W at the Earth’s
surface is W6+, but W exhibits all oxidation states
from W2- to W6+. Tungsten has ﬁve stable isotopes:
180W (0.12%), 182W (26.50%), 183W (14.31%), 184W
(30.64%) and 186W (28.43%); 180W is radioactive, but
with a half-life of 1.8 � 1018 years it is essentially
stable. While there is substantial literature describing
182W variations in meteorites, there have been
essentially no published systematic studies of low-
temperature processes involving W. However, Irisawa
and Hirata (2006) reported that W isotope ratios for
metal, is widely used in dentistry, photographic mate-
rials, mirrors and optics, control rods in nuclear reac-
tors, clothing (as an anti-fungal agent) and in certain
medicines. Silver has the highest electrical conductiv-
ity of any element and the highest thermal conductiv-
ity of any metal and thus is widely used in electrical
contacts and conductors. Silver is stable at the Earth’s
surface primarily in three oxidation states: Ag0 or
native silver, and Ag1+ and Ag2+, the common forms

sediment reference materials differed signiﬁcantly
from values for igneous rocks, hinting at the possi-
bility that low-temperature redox and/or sorption
processes may fractionate the W isotopes.
The potential for Ti to have signiﬁcant variability
of stable isotope composition in natural materials at
the Earth’s surface is probably less than that for W, V
and Re. This is due to the fact that the geochemistry of
Ti is dominated by the Ti4+ oxidation state, and Ti is
not known to play a large role in biological processes
such as enzyme stabilization. Regardless, titanium has
ﬁve stable isotopes spanning a large mass range:
46Ti (8.0%), 47Ti (7.3%), 48Ti (73.8%), 49Ti (5.5%)
and 50Ti (5.4%). If our experience with exploration of
stable isotope variability of other elements dominated
by a single oxidation state may serve as a guide, it is
not unrealistic that a thorough reconnaissance study of
Ti or other unexplored transition metal stable isotope
systematics in environmental materials (e.g. nano-
particles, pigments, electroplated steel) would reveal
unexpected surprises.
10.2 Methodology
water being collected. Pre-cleaning of the plastic con-
tainers with nitric acid may be required if container
“blanks”, obtained by allowing distilled water to sit in
the container for an extended period of time, reveal
signiﬁcant metal content. The sample needs to be
ﬁltered, the pore-size of the ﬁlter being determined
by the question being asked (e.g. is there isotopic
fractionation between colloidal and non-colloidal
size fractions?). Generally an in-line ﬁlter with 0.1 mm
pore size provides sufﬁcient ﬁltration, but this may
cause retention of some of the colloidal fraction as
well (size: 1 nm–1 mm). Alternatively, the sample can
be ﬁltered after initial collection using a plastic
syringe ﬁtted with a disposable ﬁlter cartridge. Care
must be taken to prevent possible redox changes of the
redox-sensitive species in the oxic environment.
Use of an in-line ﬁlter minimizes potential formation
of Fe- and Mn-oxyhydroxides that can scavenge
the metals from solution. Additionally, collection and
ﬁltration can be carried out in a portable nitrogen-
atmosphere glove box. The sample should be acidiﬁed
with exceptionally clean nitric or hydrochloric acid, to
a pH of approximately 2.0. Additional precautions
such as wearing ultra-clean over-garments, gloves
and boots may be required, particularly when metal
concentrations are expected to be extremely small.
Knowledge of metal concentrations in the sample
Although the transition and post-transition metals rep-
resent a geochemically diverse group of elements,
the details of the analytical procedures required for
measurement of their isotope compositions are quite
uniform. Once a laboratory establishes a protocol for
analysis of one of these metals, it can be relatively
straightforward to add more of the remaining metals to
the repertoire. On the other hand, transition and post-
transition metals are everywhere, in ﬁeld and labora-
tory equipment, and care must be taken to maintain
strict cleanliness during sample collection, processing
and measurement.
10.2.1 Sampling Protocols
prior to collection for isotope analysis is useful in
order to ensure that sufﬁcient metal is collected to
meet the requirements of the analytical technique. As
a general rule of thumb, sufﬁcient material to provide
1–10 mg of the target metal should be collected when
possible. The amount of metal required for isotope
analysis ranges from as little as 5 ng to as much as
1 mg, depending on factors such as ionization efﬁ-
ciency in the mass spectrometer and resolution mode
employed (see below). Moreover, knowledge of pro-
cedural blank levels is useful for deciding what kinds
of plastic tubing and containers to use and what pro-
tective measures to take. A worthwhile exercise is to
take a supply of the cleanest distilled laboratory water
available to the ﬁeld site and to treat the distilled water
as a sample, using all intended plastic tubing and
containers, ﬁlters and other collection equipment,
and techniques. One or two ﬁeld blanks should
be collected during each sampling session, and the
blank should be measured for concentration of
the metal of interest prior to investing time in sample
preparation and mass spectrometry.
As a general rule, the sampling protocol for transition
or post-transition metal isotope analysis of water is
identical to that for standard dissolved cation analysis.
The sample is collected using plastic tubing for pumps
or plastic containers for dipping and placed into plastic
containers that have been rinsed several times with the

Collection of solid samples such as soils, plant
tissues and landﬁll materials requires common sense
more than anything. Solid samples should be collected
into plastic bags, and care should be taken to ensure
that sampling equipment (e.g. shovels, augers, stem-
wood borers) do not contain the metal of interest.
Particular care should be taken to avoid sampling
equipment with painted surfaces as the paint is
likely to have transition or post-transition metals as
pigments.
10.2.2 Sample Preparation
8 M HCl in order to remove the majority of matrix
elements. Following this series of rinses, all that
remains on the resin are Ag, Zn, tin (Sn) and
Cd. Additional rinsing with 8 M HCl removes the
Ag, which can be retained for isotope analysis if
desired (although quantitative recovery must be
demonstrated). The rinse solution is then changed to
a 0.5 M HNO3–0.1 M HBr mixture, which removes Zn
and some of the Sn from the column; this fraction can
be retained for further processing for Zn isotope anal-
ysis, if desired. The rinse solution is then changed to
2 M HNO3, which removes the Cd and the remainder
of the Sn. This product solution is then taken to dry-
ness, re-dissolved in 6 M HCl and loaded onto a small
column containing a resin (TRU Spec, Eichrom
Industries) that retains the Sn but not the Cd, which
is collected in a beaker. The product solution contains
only Cd, and is ready for isotopic determination.
This example demonstrates the versatility of the ion
exchange resin method, and new element-speciﬁc
resins are continually being developed as the need
for new applications is encountered.
Procedures for chemical puriﬁcation of the other
Prior to mass spectrometry, the metal of interest must
be isolated from the rest of the sample matrix and
particularly from elements that would produce iso-
baric interferences on the target masses for analysis.
For example, in preparing a sample for Cr isotope
analysis, all Ti, V and Fe must be removed, as each
of these metals has an isotope at the same mass as a
Cr isotope. Similarly, some elements form double-
charged ions in the mass spectrometer that are
detected at ½ of their mass due to the direct depen-
dence of ion ﬂight path through the magnetic sector of
the mass spectrometer on mass:charge ratio of the ion.
For example, Ba2+ ions can be formed in both multi-
collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectro-
metry (MC-ICP-MS) and thermal ionization mass
spectrometry (TIMS), the two common methods for
analysis of metal stable isotope composition. 132Ba2+
would be detected at mass 66, 134Ba2+ would be
detected at mass 67, and 136Ba2+ would be detected
at mass 68, all directly overlapping the Zn isotopes of
the same masses. Thus, a goal of the chemistry is to
produce as pure a target metal fraction as possible,
preferably if not assuredly with quantitative recovery.
transition and post-transition metals follow a similar
logic and most are able to achieve quantitative recov-
ery, thereby avoiding isotope fractionation on the resin
column which has been demonstrated to occur
for several elements such as Fe (Anbar et al. 2000).

Eisenhauer (2009)
The accelerated and focused ion beam then passes
through a slit into the ﬂight tube where the different
isotopes of the element are dispersed by mass using
an electromagnet. The width of the slit determines the
ability of the mass spectrometer to partially resolve
sample ions and extraneous molecules of nearly simi-
lar mass (“isobaric interferences”). For example, since
the plasma in ICP-source instruments is predomi-
nantly composed of Ar, a narrow slit must be used to
resolve 56Fe from 40Ar16O. In TIMS instruments, 56Fe
must be resolved from organic molecules with mass
~56 atomic mass units. In general, a narrower slit
provides greater resolving power but reduced signal
intensity.
The fundamental power of MC-ICP-MS and TIMS
instruments to disperse the isotopes of an element rests
in the ability of the magnet to differentially divert the
ﬂight paths of the various isotopes according to their
individual energies. The ion ﬂight paths are bent along
the axis of the ﬂight tube depending on the ratio of ion
mass to charge: light ions are bent more (green path in
diagram), heavy ions are bent less (red path in dia-
gram). For any particular isotope, a restricted range of
ion energies leaving the magnetic sector is required to
create a concentrated, ﬂat-topped signal that is ideal
function (Bullen and Eisenhauer 2009). All instru-
ments consist of three main components: ion source,
ion optics (ion acceleration, ion beam focusing,
isotope mass separation) and ion collection. Ions are
produced by thermal processes in the source region: in
MC-ICP-MS, the sample is injected into the source
region either as a nebulized liquid aerosol or as ablated
solid particulate in a gaseous stream which passes
through a high-temperature plasma (up to 10,000�K;
see photo insert in Fig. 10.2) at near-atmospheric
pressure. At this high temperature, atoms of the sam-
ple material are very efﬁciently ionized. In TIMS, the
sample is deposited on a wire ﬁlament (see photo insert
in Fig. 10.2), placed in a high vacuum (~10-8 torr), and
the ﬁlament is heated to the temperature required for
ion production of the particular element (typically
800–1,700�C). The ions produced in either instrument
then enter the optics region, where they are accelerated
through a large potential (up to 10 kV) and focused
electronically to create a discrete ion beam. In MC-
ICP-MS, the vacuum must be substantially improved
over this short optics region via efﬁcient mechanical
and electrical “ion getter” vacuum pumps. Beyond the
ion optics region, an exceptional vacuum (~10-8 torr)
must be maintained in both instruments.

for detection and measurement. In TIMS, ions of a
particular isotope produced at the source ﬁlament are
essentially mono-energetic, and once the ion beam is
focused in the source region mass (i.e. energy) disper-
sion can be effectively achieved in the magnetic sec-
tor. In contrast, in MC-ICP-MS ions of a particular
isotope leave the source region having a fairly wide
energy distribution due to numerous processes occur-
ring in the source region. Thus in most MC-ICP-MS
instruments, the poly-energetic ion beam must ﬁrst

composition of all the transition and post-transition
metals discussed in this chapter can be most efﬁciently
determined using MC-ICP-MS. The high ionization
efﬁciency of the plasma source used to generate ions
in MC-ICP-MS compared to that of the metal ﬁlament
source used in TIMS results in improved isotope mea-
surement of very small quantities (i.e. tens of nano-
grams) of elements with high ionization potentials,
such as Zn (e.g. Chen et al. 2008), Mo (e.g. Barling
and Anbar 2004), and Hg (e.g. Blum and Bergquist
2007). In addition, MC-ICP-MS instruments typically
have the capability to sufﬁciently resolve measureable
portions of metal ion beams from “isobaric” poly-
atomic interfering species having nearly the same
mass (e.g.
56Fe vs.
40Ar16O generated in the Ar
shown) which disperses the ion beam in exactly the
opposite sense to that which follows in the magnetic
sector. As a result of exacting electromechanical
design, the ion beam that ultimately passes out of the
magnetic sector has a balanced and much smaller
energy spread that allows the ﬂat-topped signal to
develop. In a few MC-ICP-MS instruments, the ion
beam ﬁrst passes through a “collision cell” containing
molecules of a gas such as Ar where collisions of the
metal ions with the gas molecules substantially reduce
the kinetic energies of those ions, which can then
be reaccelerated in a nearly mono-energetic condition
for passage through the magnetic ﬁeld as in TIMS.
Ion detection collectors are conﬁgured to perfectly
plasma). Some interfering species, primarily oxides,
can also be removed from the ion stream to a large
extent by desolvating the sample prior to introduction
to the plasma. Alternatively, in some instruments
polyatomic molecules can be disaggregated in the
collision cell apparatus described above due to colli-
sions of the molecules with atoms of the gas supplied
to the cell. In MC-IPC-MS, uncertainty due to signal
noise resulting from the inherent instability of the
plasma source is eliminated by measuring all ion
beams simultaneously with the multicollector array.
An additional strength of MC-ICP-MS is that samples
can be introduced using laser ablation equipment, in
which layers of atoms are sputtered off the surface of
a solid material and transported by a gas stream to
the plasma for ionization. Excellent references on the
general topic of isotope analysis by MC-ICP-MS are
Albare`de and Beard (2004), Rehk€amper et al. (2004)
and Wieser and Schwieters (2005).
On the other hand, TIMS has been used for more
intersect the resulting ﬂight paths of the component
isotope ion beams of the element. In some instruments,
collectors can be moved perpendicularly to the ion
paths until desired coincidence is achieved for a
particular element. In other instruments, the collector
positions are ﬁxed and the trajectories of the ion beams
themselves are adjusted along the ﬁnal section of the
ﬂight tube by further electronic focusing in order to
achieve coincidence. Collectors are either Faraday
cages, credit-card sized, thin rectangular boxes open
on one narrow end to receive and trap ions on the
internal surfaces resulting in a measurable total ion
current on the internal surfaces, or ion counters that
record individual ion collisions with the counter sur-
faces. Faraday cages may have slits positioned along
the ion ﬂight path prior to the point of ion entry into
the cage in order to better shape the ion beam for
optimum signal detection. Channel-speciﬁc total ion
currents detected over a certain period of time are then
processed through a series of electronic conversions
into signals that can be interpreted by computer soft-
ware as relative isotope abundances for the element.
Each instrument has its advantages in certain
applications, but as a general rule the stable isotope
than 50 years and has long been the workhorse for
metal isotope research. TIMS provided much of the
data on transition and post-transition metal stable iso-
tope systematics prior to the proliferation of MC-ICP-
MS in research labs and continues to provide excellent
isotope measurements for more readily ionized ele-
ments such as Cr (e.g. Ellis et al. 2002) and Fe (Bullen
and Amundson 2010) and even for elements that are
difﬁcult to ionize such as Cd (Schmitt et al. 2009a, b).
TIMS is less affected by isobaric interferences than
MC–ICP–MS because there is no need for the Ar gas
and because the sample is ionized under high vacuum
rather than in an aqueous solution or gas stream
at atmospheric pressure. TIMS likewise beneﬁts from

(Fantle and Bullen 2009). Typical external precision
(i.e. comparison of total procedural replicates for nat-
ural samples) is at the 0.1‰ level for both TIMS and
MC–ICP–MS. A disadvantage of both instruments is a
sizable footprint in the laboratory and high costs for
purchase and maintenance.
10.2.4 Data: Acquisition, Reduction,
Accuracy, and Standard
Reference Materials
industrially enriched in their proportion relative to
the other isotopes. There are now several commercial
suppliers of highly enriched (i.e. typically >90% pure)
stable isotopes of most multi-isotopic elements, and
thus it is relatively straightforward to create a double
spike using any combination of two isotopes of an
element. The double spike mixture, which has been
carefully characterized for isotope composition and
concentration, is added to a sample prior to analysis
thus imparting an unnatural isotope composition to the
sample-double spike mixture. Following analysis,
the measured ratio of the two isotopes used to create
the double spike can be compared to the known, care-
fully characterized value to obtain a “mass bias factor”
that quantiﬁes isotope fractionation that has occurred
during analysis. The measured isotope composition of
the sample-double spike mixture can then be corrected
based on this mass bias factor, and the double spike
component of the mixture can be mathematically
subtracted from the fractionation-corrected composi-
tion to reveal the natural ratios of the two or more
isotopes not used for the double spike as the residual.
For example, the 53Cr/52Cr natural isotope ratio of
Isotope fractionation of the ion beam produced in both
TIMS and MC-ICP-MS, which is an unavoidable char-
acteristic of both analytical platforms, means that the
relative proportion of isotopes of an element reaching
the detectors in the mass spectrometer is not identical
to that of the sample. This instrument-induced frac-
tionation, or “mass bias”, is often larger than the
isotopic variation between samples. In MC-IPC-MS,
light ions of any element are preferentially discrimi-
nated against and removed from the ion stream at
the sampling cones situated just beyond the plasma
source, resulting in relatively heavy raw measured
ratios that tend to stay very constant over the course
of a measurement. In TIMS, light ions of any element
are preferentially ionized off the ﬁlament surface,
causing the raw measured ratio to be light at the outset
and progressively heavier over the course of a mea-
surement. Thus it is essential to provide some means to
correct for isotope discrimination so that measured
isotope compositions of samples can be compared to
those of standards and other samples.
a sample can be determined using a double spike
consisting of a mixture of nearly pure 50Cr and 54Cr,
the two minor isotopes of Cr. Of the elements dis-
cussed here, Cr, Fe, Ni, Zn, Cd, Mo, Hg, Ti, and W
are suitable for analysis by the double spike technique
while Ag, Re and V are not. An important advantage
of the double spike technique is that the double
spike solution can be added to the sample prior to puri-
ﬁcation chemistry, and thus, without any additional
effort, can be used to correct for isotope fractionation
that might occur during chemical puriﬁcation prior to
analysis (e.g. due to non-quantitative recovery of the
metal from the resin).
The classic approach to correct for isotope discrim-
The nature of MC-ICP-MS allows application of
ination in TIMS is referred to as the double spike
technique. An excellent treatment of the theoretical
aspects of the double spike technique is given by
Johnson and Beard (1999), and a practical overview
of the technique is provided by Rudge et al. (2009).
This technique requires that the element have at least
four naturally-occurring isotopes, two that can be used
as isotopes for the double spike and two that can be
used to calculate a ratio that provides information
on the relative natural isotope composition of a sam-
ple. The double spike is a mixture of two typically
minor isotopes of the element that have each been
two additional techniques for correction of isotope
discrimination in the instrument during analysis,
standard-sample-standard bracketing and internal
standardization. As the name implies, in standard-
sample-standard bracketing a standard solution is
analyzed directly before and after a sample, and the
interpolated isotope ratio of the standard at the time of
the sample analysis is taken as the reference value.
This is an incredibly straightforward approach, but
assumes that the sample and standard behave similarly
in the plasma (e.g. have identical matrices). With
internal standardization, an element with a known

than the reference material, which in this case is NIST
979 Cr metal. There are two important variants of the d
notation: (1) DA-B may be used to represent the differ-
ence in d values between two samples, A and B; and
(2) workers may use the e notation, equal to 10 times
d, or parts per 10,000, in cases where differences in
isotope composition between samples are extremely
small. Caution is advised as there are additional uses
of both D and e in isotope science terminology, and
some researchers report isotope ratio variations on a
per atomic mass unit basis.
Standard reference materials (SRM) provide the
isotope composition and similar fractionation behav-
ior to the element being analyzed is added to the
sample solution prior to aspiration into the plasma
(e.g. Zr as an internal standard for Mo isotope analysis,
Cu as an internal standard for Fe or Zn isotope analy-
sis). The isotope ratio measured for the internal stan-
dard can be compared to its known value to quantify
machine-induced fractionation and a correction can
then be applied to the isotope ratio of the target ele-
ment on a scan by scan basis. Using internal standar-
dization, a plot of the measured isotope ratios of the
target element vs. those of the internal standard ele-
ment typically deﬁnes a mass dependent fractionation
relationship that provides the basis for the correction
(Longerich et al. (1987); Mare´chal et al. (1999).
The power of the standard-sample-standard brack-
eting and internal standardization techniques is that
they can be used for isotopic analysis of any element
having two or more isotopes. On the other hand, the
double spike technique required for TIMS stable iso-
tope analysis can likewise be used for MC-ICP-MS
isotope analysis of elements having four or more iso-
topes, and is in essence a special case of internal
standardization. The advantage of using a double
spike for MC-ICP-MS analysis is that quantitative
yield during sample puriﬁcation is not required as it
is for standard-sample-standard bracketing and inter-
nal standardization approaches (Siebert et al. 2001).
Differences in transition and post-transition metal
stable isotope composition between materials tend
to be small, a few parts per thousand at most, so
that differences in absolute isotope ratio are difﬁcult
to conceptualize. For example, say that the 53Cr/52Cr
ratio determined by TIMS for a native groundwater
sample is 0.114000, while the value for the Cr isotope
standard is 0.113392. To better visualize this small
difference, most researchers in the ﬁeld have adopted
the delta notation used for gas isotope ratio compari-
son so that ratios can be compared on a per mil (‰)
basis. Using the Cr example:
basis for inter- and intra-laboratory comparison of
isotope ratio measurements. While the mass spectro-
meters used in different laboratories might produce
different absolute values for an SRM, the ratios
obtained on samples are comparable through use of
the delta scale described above, calculated relative to
the SRM. Most standards used in metal stable isotope
research are supplied by two sources: the Institute
for Reference Materials and Measurements (IRMM,
Belgium) and the National Institute for Standards and
Technology (NIST, USA). Both organizations have
gone to great lengths to produce large quantities of
metal isotope SRM, which have been rigorously
assessed through round-robin analyses at a number of
isotope laboratories. A good SRM must (1) be in
abundant supply and available for distribution, (2) be
homogeneous in isotopic composition across the supply,
(3) have an isotopic composition similar to or border-
ing the range to be measured in samples, and (4) have
an agreed-upon value. Ideally, for a given metal it
is preferable to have at least two well-characterized
SRM that bracket the range of isotope ratios antici-
pated in samples. This is rarely the case, and thus most
researchers rely on a single SRM that is used widely
by other laboratories, together with routinely analyzed
internal standards used to monitor consistency of lab-
oratory processing and mass spectrometer function.
An important point is that all isotope research should
be conducted using widely available SRM in order to
allow other laboratories to make a check of accuracy.

IRMM and NIST typically supply an SRM for

favored in the product phase. Examples of processes
resulting in kinetic isotope effects are evaporation,
where light isotopes of metals such as Zn and Cd
escape more efﬁciently at the liquid-air interface than
heavy isotopes (e.g. Cloquet et al. 2006a, b), electro-
plating, where light isotopes of metals from the plating
bath are preferentially deposited onto a metal substrate
(Kavner et al. 2008), and diffusion (Richter et al.
2009). A special class of kinetic isotope effects arises
for elements having differences in speciﬁc isotope
reaction rates, for example where the odd-numbered
isotopes of Hg behave non-systematically with respect
to the even-numbered isotopes (Bergquist and Blum
2009; Blum 2011). Isotope equilibrium results from
protracted exchange between reaction products and
reactants, and at equilibrium the products may be
either lighter or heavier than the reactants depending
on factors such as metal ion coordination, packing
density and bond strength. Examples of processes
resulting in isotope equilibrium are the partitioning
of relatively heavy Fe into [Fe(III)(H2O)6](aq)

metal stable isotope analysis in the form of a puriﬁed
metal or salt, both of which are easy to dissolve and
use routinely. However, some researchers choose
to use natural samples as standards, provided those
samples meet the criteria listed above. The advan-
tage of using a natural material as an SRM is that it
must follow the same chemical puriﬁcation steps as
samples, thus assuring integrity of the chemical pro-
cedures. For some metals, there are both natural and
synthetic SRM. For Fe stable isotope research, for
example, there are two widely available SRM: speciﬁc
basalts and other igneous rocks, which have been
shown to have uniform isotope composition (Beard
et al. 2003), and IRMM-014, a synthetic iron standard.
The isotope composition of IRMM-014 is now gener-
ally considered to be the zero point for the delta scale;
on this basis, igneous rocks have on average a d56/54Fe
value of þ0.09‰. Unfortunately, Fe lacks SRM
having isotope compositions at the light and heavy
extremes of the natural spectrum.

Processes
that are subsequently reversed (Skulan et al. 2002).
Note that isotope equilibrium between liquid and
vapor is likewise possible, as in the case of Hg
(Estrade et al. 2009). Excellent discussions of the
topic of kinetic and equilibrium isotope fractionation,
with examples pertinent to environmental studies, are
provided by Clark and Fritz (1997) and Kendall and
McDonnell (1998).
Redox reactions, whether strictly inorganic or
Isotope fractionation is a set of processes which can
divide an isotopically homogeneous pool of an ele-
ment into multiple fractions that have different com-
plementary isotope compositions. For a given element,
observed fractionation may be either mass dependent,
scaling approximately as the mass difference between
isotope pairs, or mass independent, where one isotope
behaves non-systematically with respect to the others.
By far, most of the stable isotope variability of the
transition and post-transition metals observed to date
has resulted from mass dependent processes.
There are two main categories of isotope frac-
tionation processes that affect the transition and
post-transition metals, kinetic isotope effects and equi-
librium isotope exchange. Kinetic isotope effects
result from uni-directional physical and chemical
reactions, during which the light isotope is always
microbially mediated, consistently result in signiﬁcant
metal stable isotope fractionation, and the reduced
species of the metal redox pair is generally isotopi-
cally lighter than the oxidized species. Thus, deter-
mination of the isotope composition of redox-sensitive
metals has proven useful for understanding redox
dynamics in paleo- and present-day environmental
systems (Severmann and Anbar 2009; Bergquist and
Blum 2009; Bullen and Walczyk 2009). On the other
hand, the stable isotope composition of metals which
occur naturally in only one redox state (e.g. Cd, Zn)

but which may fractionate during complexation with
redox-sensitive species such as sulfur (Schauble 2003)
or with organic matter (Weiss et al. 2007) can likewise
be indicative of redox conditions.
Sorption of metals onto the surfaces of minerals in
and Mineev 2000; Schauble 2004). Siderite synthesis
experiments conﬁrm the sense of this theoretical frac-
tionation, but observed magnitudes are less than those
predicted by theory (Wiesli et al. 2004). Gaining a
better understanding of aqueous metal coordination
environments and the implications for stable isotope
fractionation is one of the major challenges facing the
ﬁeld.
10.4 Applications of Metal Isotopes
to Environmental Studies
3+ in a series of carefully
sediments and soils is an environmentally important
process that can help to moderate aqueous concentra-
tions of those metals and aid in metal contaminant
remediation. Isotope fractionation associated with
sorption has been recognized for several of the transi-
tion and post-transition metals, but is highly element
speciﬁc. For example, sorption of isotopically light
Mo onto ferromanganese oxides in the oxic oceans is
viewed as having been an important isotope fraction-
ation process for Mo over much of Earth history
(Wasylenki et al. 2008). In contrast, sorbed Fe(II)
on goethite was found to be isotopically heavy com-
pared to [Fe(II)(H2O)6](aq)
-
conducted equilibrium isotope exchange experiments
reported by Beard et al. (2010). In the case of Cr,
only a negligible isotope fractionation was observed
between sorbed and aqueous CrO4
2- and HCr2O7
when either g-Al2O3 or goethite was used as the sorp-
tion substrate (Ellis et al. 2004).
Coordination environment of the metals in liquids
The transition and post-transition metals are subject to
numerous potential isotope fractionation processes
over a wide range of environmental conditions, and
thus their isotope compositions may provide a unique
record of those processes that can be used to under-
stand present-day and paleo-environmental systems.
In this section, several examples are given that illus-
trate the spectrum of environmental issues that can be
addressed using these novel stable isotope tracers as
process recorders. These include using the isotopes to

cesses, to assess plant nutrition cycles and understand

Although familiarity with the general topic of stable
isotope biogeochemistry will help the reader to appre-
ciate the details of the following examples, the intro-
ductory material and references in this and other
chapters of this book should help those not familiar
with the ﬁeld to better understand why the isotopes are
useful and how they work in these speciﬁc cases.

and solids is an additional important determinant of
stable isotope fractionation. In general, for a given
system chemistry, higher coordination favors the ligh-
ter isotopes. Using the system Fe-O as an example, Fe
in hematite (Fe2O3) is in octahedral coordination while
Fe in magnetite (Fe3O4) is in both octahedral and
tetrahedral coordination within their respective oxy-
gen framework. The result is a higher average coordi-
nation number for Fe in hematite than for Fe in
magnetite. As expected, when the two phases coexist
at or near equilibrium, Fe in hematite is isotopically
lighter than Fe in magnetite by approximately 3‰, as
has been reported for coexisting magnetite-hematite
pairs in banded iron formations (Johnson et al. 2003).
The difference in metal ion coordination environment
in coexisting solid-liquid pairs is likewise an impor-
tant determinant of stable isotope fractionation. For
example, theoretical calculations of equilibrium iso-
tope fractionation predict that aqueous Fe(II), which is
in octahedral coordination within a “hexaquo” inner
hydration sphere ([Fe(II)(H2O)6](aq)
The ability of isotope signatures to trace the sources of
and processes affecting metal contaminants in ground-
water and the atmosphere appears to be receiving the
most attention from research groups focused on envi-
ronmental applications of transition and post-transition
metal stable isotopes. Of metal contaminants in
groundwater, Cr(VI) is arguably the best understood
in terms of isotope systematics based on laboratory
heavier than Fe(II) in coexisting siderite (FeCO3), in
which the Fe(II) is in more open octahedral coordina-
tion with oxygen of the carbonate groups (Polyakov

study the fate of toxic Cr contamination at numerous
ﬁeld sites. Of the potential metal contaminants in the
atmosphere, the most progress has been made in
understanding Hg sources and sinks as discussed by
Blum (2011), but Zn, Cd and Cr are likewise receiving
considerable attention and are discussed here.

for Cr stable isotope composition (Bullen 2007). As
shown in Fig. 10.3, the data plot along a well-
organized trend, with near-facility (contaminant) and
regional groundwaters deﬁning the extremes, while
samples from the contaminant plume plot in between.
There is no question that in this particular case, the
Cr stable isotopes clearly distinguish the natural and
anthropogenic Cr(VI) end-members.
It is less clear how the samples collected from

in d53/52Cr-Cr concentration space. For example, as
shown in Fig. 10.3 the plume sample data all lie well
to the low-Cr side of model trends describing both
abiotic and microbially-mediated Cr(VI) reduction
(Ellis et al. 2002; Sikora et al. 2008) and well to the
high-d53/52Cr side of the model trend for advective

As described above in the overview of Cr, reduction of
Cr(VI) to Cr(III) is accompanied by a large isotope
fractionation. Thus, Cr stable isotopes should be use-
ful for monitoring Cr(VI) reduction in a contaminant
plume, for distinguishing between Cr(VI) reduction
and advective mixing with Cr-free groundwater (two
mechanisms that can decrease Cr(VI) concentrations
in the contaminant plume), and potentially for distin-
guishing between industrial and natural sources of Cr
(VI). Sources of Cr used for industrial purposes are
likely to be Cr ore deposits and minerals, which con-
sistently have d53/52Cr values close to 0‰ relative to
NIST 979 (Ellis et al. 2002; Schoenberg et al. 2008).
In contrast, naturally occurring Cr in groundwater dis-
plays a range of values (d53/52Cr: +1.0 to +5.8‰; Ellis
et al. 2002; Izbicki et al. 2008). These values likely
reﬂect fractionation during oxidation of Cr(III) on
manganese oxides and fractionation during subsequent
reduction of Cr(VI) along groundwater ﬂowpaths fol-
lowing mobilization of the highly soluble Cr(VI) from
mineral surface sorption sites. Thus under favorable
conditions the natural and industrial Cr pools at a con-
taminated site may have different d53/52Cr values.
In order to test the usefulness of Cr stable isotopes
regional groundwaters, suggesting that neither Cr(VI)
reduction nor advective mixing alone is able to
account for those compositions. However, some com-
bination of Cr(VI) reduction and advective mixing
could account for the plume sample compositions,
and a scenario that is at least consistent with ﬁeld
relations (Bullen 2007) is shown in Fig. 10.3. In this
scenario, Cr(VI) at the front and margins of the migrat-
ing contaminant plume would come into contact with
the limited reductant (e.g. ferrous iron, organic matter)
in this aquifer, allowing small amounts of Cr(VI)
reduction to occur and driving remnant Cr(VI) compo-
sitions along the model Cr(VI) reduction vectors. At
the same time, advective mixing with regional ground-
waters at the plume front and margins would shift
remnant Cr(VI) compositions to the low-Cr side of
the model Cr(VI) reduction vectors (e.g. along trajec-
tories similar to the lines labeled “plume front Cr(VI)
reduction-mixing” in Fig. 10.3). After 40 years of
plume migration, one could imagine an array of devel-
oped plume front and margin groundwater composi-
tions similar to region “FM” in Fig. 10.3. This range of
plume front and margin groundwater compositions
would result from speciﬁc evolutionary trends that
depend on the relative amount of Cr(VI) reduction
and advective mixing with regional groundwater that
occurred at any particular position along the plume
front or margin. In this scenario, the actual plume
sample array would develop by advective mixing
between these hypothesized plume front and margin
groundwaters and the contaminated groundwater

“Erin Brockovich.” From 1952 to 1966, waste water
containing Cr(VI) used as an anti-corrosive in the
cooling towers leaked into the underlying sandy
aquifer, creating a plume of Cr(VI)-contaminated

likewise pointed to the potential importance of hetero-

tory incubation experiments had demonstrated that Cr
(VI) reduction was limited to greenish, ﬁne-grained
lenses that are embedded in non-reducing aquifer
materials. They proposed that total reduction of

through the non-reducing aquifer materials. As a
result, the d53/52Cr value of groundwater sampled
along the plume is not as high and the d53/52Cr value
of Cr(III) immobilized on the aquifer sediment
is not as low as would be predicted for a system
where reduction occurs homogeneously throughout
the aquifer. As at Hinkley, careful discrete depth
sampling would help to determine the inﬂuence of
aquifer heterogeneity on Cr(VI) reduction effective-
ness and measured d53/52Cr values.

Fig. 10.3 d53/52Cr and Cr(VI) concentration data for ground-
water at the Hinkley, CA site “Cr source” samples were col-
lected at the PG&E compressor facility, “Cr plume” samples
were collected downgradient of the compressor facility within
the Cr(VI) plume. “Regional groundwater” samples were col-
lected just upgradient, just down gradient, and well away from
the plume. The “Cr source-regional groundwater mixing” curve
shows mixing between Cr source and average regional ground-
water. The “abiotic Cr(VI) reduction vector” is from Ellis et al.
(2002); the “microbial Cr(VI) reduction” vectors are from
Sikora et al. (2008), and show the range of fractionation
observed in their experiments. The ﬁeld labeled “FM” repre-
sents plume Front and Margin samples produced through com-
bined Cr(VI) reduction and advective mixing with regional

source” groundwaters. The arrow labeled “Cr(VI) remaining in
plume following partial reduction” shows the direction that
homogeneous Cr(VI) reduction within the plume will move
residual Cr(VI) compositions on this diagram. The arrow
labeled “immobilized Cr(III)” shows that Cr(III) produced dur-
ing Cr(VI) reduction will have negative d53/52Cr. The uncer-
tainty of the data for all samples is less than the size of the

As described above in the overview on Zn, there are
several processes that may result in Zn stable isotope
fractionation including biological incorporation, abi-
otic adsorption, chemical diffusion and industrial pro-
cessing. Although Zn is not a highly toxic metal it does
provide a useful index of environmental contamina-
tion because it is commonly associated with toxic
metals such as Cd and Pb. Thus Zn stable isotopes
may be useful for distinguishing natural and anthro-
pogenic sources of metals in both hydrologic and
atmospheric systems.
An interesting example of the usefulness of Zn
within the plume body itself. Note that extremely
careful, discrete depth sampling at the plume front
and margins would be necessary to conﬁrm the exis-
tence and determine the exact shape of the “FM”
region hypothesized in Fig. 10.3, but such an effort
would be useful for supporting the validity of this
proposed scenario.
In their detailed time-series study of a point-source
Cr contamination plume emanating from a Cr plating
facility in Berkeley, California, Berna et al. (2010)
observed a similar trend for plume groundwater
samples in d53/52Cr-Cr concentration space, such that
the plume samples had intermediate compositions
between vectors describing Cr(VI) reduction and
advective mixing with Cr-free groundwater. Although

Chen et al. (2008, 2009) who studied Zn isotope sys-
tematics of the Seine River of France. The Seine River
is one of the most anthropogenically impacted rivers in
Europe, with high relative concentrations of metals
(Zn, Cu, Pb, Ni, etc.) in dissolved and suspended
loads compared to large rivers of the world (Chen
et al. 2009). For their study, these workers sampled
both the dissolved and suspended particulate matter
(SPM) fractions of Seine River waters along the length

of the river and, during both high and low ﬂow peri-
ods, in the center of the city of Paris. This sampling
strategy allowed these workers to test for a Zn isotope
signal of industrial and urban activity, since most
industry is concentrated in and downstream of Paris.
Chen et al. (2009) observed an overall negative
correlation between d66/64Zn of SPM and the Zn
enrichment factor (EF), which describes the enrich-
ment of Zn in a sample relative to the natural back-
ground and is deﬁned as:
EF ¼ ðZn=AlÞsample=ðZn=AlÞbackground
where (Zn/Al)background was estimated using average
concentrations of Zn and Al in uncontaminated forest
sediments and pre-historical deposits as assessed by
Thevenot et al. (2007). Speciﬁcally, as shown in
Fig. 10.4a, SPM samples with lesser d66/64Zn and
greater Zn EF were those collected within Paris during
the low ﬂow periods and from downstream of Paris.
Chen et al. (2009) identiﬁed two potential anthro-
pogenic contaminant sources, Zn in roof runoff from
buildings in Paris and waste water treatment plant
efﬂuent, each having low d66/64Zn and high Zn EF
that could explain the low ﬂow Zn isotope signal.
In contrast, background Zn from upstream sources
was determined to have elevated d66/64Zn and low
Zn EF based on analyses of bedrock from the region
(the composition for bedrock granite from the region is
shown in Fig. 10.4a) and the compositions of SPM
from upstream of Paris.
Chen et al. (2009) observed additional complexity

chalk), and an anthropogenic end-member having Zn isotope
composition similar to that of Zn roof runoff and waste water

additional “urban” end-member (Znurb, having d66/64Zn of

of dissolved Zn together (Fig. 10.4b). Seine Basin
transect and Paris low ﬂow samples deﬁned a linear
array that could be explained by mixing between
natural and anthropogenic end-members. The natural
end-member (Znnat) was inferred to have d66/64Zn of
SPM similar to that of bedrock granite (+0.33‰) and
d66/64Zn of dissolved Zn similar to that of Cretaceous
chalk from the region (+0.90‰), highlighting the fact
that Zn in SPM and the dissolved phase can come from
different sources. Some Paris high ﬂow samples
required an additional component, again having
d66/64Zn of SPM similar to that of bedrock granite,
but having d66/64Zn of dissolved Zn reﬂecting a mix-

a Multi-Tracer Approach
the other potential sources of metals in dust listed
above are less constrained, although some reconnais-
sance values for Zn are available in the literature.
Cloquet et al. (2006b) reported d66/64Zn values for
particulates trapped on bus air ﬁlters and emitted in
urban waste incinerator ﬂue gas from Metz, France,
which spanned a small range from +0.04 to +0.19‰
relative to the JMC-Lyon Zn standard. On the other
hand, lichens collected from around Metz that had
high Pb concentrations and Pb isotope signatures
consistent with a leaded gasoline source likewise had
high Zn concentrations and negative d66/64Zn (to
�0.2‰), suggesting that light Zn might be associated
with road trafﬁc circulation. Sivry et al. (2008)
reported d66/64Zn of +0.72‰ for a coal ash from
southwest France, which is consistent with the associ-
ation of heavy Zn with organic materials recognized
by Weiss et al. (2007).
In their study of sources of metals observed in dust
Inhalation of dust particles is potentially a primary
delivery mechanism of toxic metals to humans. More-
over, incorporation of deposited dust in soil can allow
the metals to become available to plants, providing an
additional source of metal loading to crops. There are
many possible sources of transition and post-transition
metals that could supply the metal content of dust. The
major contributors are likely to include metal reﬁning
and smelting, coal combustion ﬂy ash and residues,
petroleum burning and particularly vehicle emissions,
municipal waste incineration, scrap metal deterioration,
and wood burning. Early approaches for identifying
dust sources relied on tracers such as concentration
ratios of metals and surrogates such as strontium iso-
topes that might be able to tie the dust back to speciﬁc
geologic or regional sources. While there have been
numerous examples of success with this approach,
environmental isotope scientists have been exploring
whether the stable isotope composition of the transition
and post-transition metals might be more directly use-
ful for ﬁngerprinting the sources of the metals in dust.
Of the potential sources for these metals listed
samples collected in Paris, France, Widory et al.
(2010) have expanded this emerging isotope database
for the sources and speciﬁcally have measured Zn, Cd,
and Cr stable isotope compositions for each of their
samples. Important aspects of their data, shown
in Fig. 10.5a and b, include: (1) a broad range of
d114/110Cd for particulates in vehicle exhaust; (2) the
tendency of organic-associated materials such as fuel
oil and coal to have positive d66/64Zn; and (3) the
positive d53/52Cr values of the coal combustion sam-
ples, perhaps reﬂecting the particular redox history of
the coal deposit. These data highlight the potential
variability of the anthropogenic signal and show the
utility of the multi-isotope approach.
Although the inﬂuence of dust from deteriorating
above, metal reﬁning and smelting have received the
most attention, mainly for Zn and Cd, pointing to
the unique physical characteristics of these two post-
transition metals. As noted above in the overview on
these elements, their boiling points are sufﬁciently low
that they can both be evaporated in the smelter fur-
nace, resulting in a kinetic isotope fractionation that
partitions light metal into the vapor that escapes the
factory stack. For Zn, light compositions in reﬁnery
stack emissions have been documented by Mattielli
et al. (2009), while heavy compositions in residual
slag compositions have been documented by Sivry
et al. (2009). For Cd, the same sense of isotope frac-
tionation was observed for smelter exhaust and slag by
Cloquet et al. (2006a). Mercury similarly has a low
boiling point within the range of smelter and waste
incinerator furnace temperatures, and partitioning
of light Hg into stack emissions has been proposed
(Estrade et al. 2010). Thus the association of light Zn,
Cd, and Hg, along with unfractionated compositions
relative to the ore sources for other metals having far
greater boiling points (such as Cr and Cu) could impli-
cate a metal reﬁning smelter exhaust stack source for
those metals in dust samples.
metal in scrapyards has yet to be rigorously quantiﬁed
in terms of either metal ﬂux or stable isotope compo-
sition, there is potentially an important isotope signal
resulting from electroplating as noted above. Electro-
plating is a ubiquitous process that can produce an
isotopically light pool for all the transition and post-
transition metals (e.g. Kavner et al. 2008), and recog-
nition of light isotope compositions for a suite of
metals such as Zn, Cd and Cr in a set of dust samples
may point to such sources. Cadmium and Zn isotope
compositions of an electroplated metal nut and Cr
and Zn isotope compositions of an electroplated
metal bolt, measured by the author, are included
in Fig. 10.5a and b to illustrate the potential signal.

Stable Isotopes of Transition and Post-Transition Metals as Tracers in Environmental Studies
195
fractionation between oxidized and reduced states
points to the potentially powerful application of
the isotopes as tracers of redox cycles in natural sys-
tems. Isotopes can be used, for example, to distinguish
between biological and geochemical processes, such
as microbial reduction and inorganic oxidation, and
physical processes, such as advective mixing and dif-
fusion, to explain chemical and isotopic composition
gradients in hydrologic systems.
Teutsch et al. (2009) used Fe isotopes to study the
Fe cycle across the oxic-anoxic boundary of mero-
mictic Lake Nyos, Cameroon, the site of a sudden
catastrophic release of CO2 in 1986 that killed about
1,700 people. To avoid the recurrence of catastrophic
outgassing of CO2 that is supplied by groundwater to
the lake bottom, the lake is now artiﬁcially degassed
by a tube that drains deep water to the surface (Kling
et al. 2005). The degassing system spreads deep water
with concentrations of dissolved Fe(II) in a high jet
over the lake, causing immediate oxidation of the Fe
(II) to Fe(III)-oxyhydroxide particulate which then
settles into the lake. Concentrations of dissolved
Fe(II) in the oxic surface waters are negligible, but
sharply increase as particles settle across the oxic-
anoxic boundary at depth. Partial reduction of the
Fe(III)-rich particles at this boundary releases Fe(II)
to solution, which then diffuses upwards into the
oxic zone where it is re-oxidized to form Fe(III)-
oxyhydroxides which settle back to the oxic-anoxic
boundary, and the cycle continues.
Depth proﬁles sampled in the lake revealed a sharp

The obvious need to understand the potential inﬂuence
of deteriorating electroplated metal stockpiles on the

future research.
10.4.2 Metal Redox Cycles
Teutsch et al. (2009) showed that the sharp increase
in d57/54Fe values is caused by isotopic fractionation
associated with dissimilatory Fe(III) reduction across
the oxic-anoxic boundary. They further showed that
the continued shift toward even greater d57/54Fe values
below the oxic-anoxic boundary is due to vertical
mixing of Fe–rich lake bottom water that has high-
d57/54Fe values, perhaps due to precipitation of
siderite. In this study, isotopic analyses coupled to

Isotopes can likewise be used to assess paleoredox

conditions in water bodies, for example by looking at
variations of the redox-sensitive Mo isotope composi-
tion of sediments. In oxic settings, Mo isotopes are
fractionated during adsorption of Mo to ferroman-
ganese oxides, with light isotopes preferentially
associated with the solids. Experimental work under
oxidizing conditions has shown that d97/95Mo of aque-
ous Mo in seawater is 2.7‰ greater than that of
adsorbed Mo on sediment (Barling et al. 2001;
Barling and Anbar 2004; Wasylenki et al. 2008). As
waters progress from oxic to suboxic to anoxic to
euxinic (i.e. sulﬁdic) conditions, MoO4
cycles of low temperature alteration of igneous copper
porphyries, marine sedimentary diagenesis and epige-
netic mobilization of Cu in sandstones at a site of
historic Cu mining in southern Israel. As predicted
by theory and experiment, they found that d65/63Cu
values of Cu(I)-sulﬁdes in the stratiform sediment-
hosted Cu deposits are signiﬁcantly lower than those
of coexisting Cu(II)-carbonates and hydroxides. Cou-
pling the Cu isotope composition of the minerals to
a mass balance model revealed that the main Cu reser-
voir of the ore body is a sandstone-shale sequence and
that the importance of Cu-sulﬁde reservoirs is small,
consistent with ﬁeld observations. Thus most of the Cu
transport occurred in relatively oxidized conditions,
the knowledge of which provides a novel tool for
exploration in the future.

aqueous Mo to be more effectively removed to the
sediment (Poulson et al. 2006; Neubert et al. 2008).
The net result is that the isotopic contrast between
aqueous and sorbed Mo is greatest at slightly reducing
conditions and low sedimentation rates, but decreases
with increasingly reducing and sulﬁdic conditions due
to increasingly more quantitative removal of Mo from
solution.
This concept was used by Siebert et al. (2006) to
account for differences in the average Mo isotope
composition of sediment proﬁles from continental mar-
gin settings. These workers recognized a co-variation
between the Mo isotope composition of the sediments
and the rate of both authigenic Mo accumulation and
organic carbon oxidation and burial under reducing
conditions. Malinovsky et al. (2007) tried the same
approach to understand paleoredox cycles in lakes
from northern Sweden and northwestern Russia, where
variations of Mo isotope composition in the sediments
could be attributed to both redox status of the water
column and isotopically variable input of Mo into the
lakes due to Mo isotopic heterogeneity of bedrock in
the drainage basins. This latter study points to the need
for rigorous source term characterization, particularly
as study site size decreases from global to local scale.
Numerous transition and post-transition metals play
important chemical roles in plant nutrition (Marschner
1995). For example, of the metals discussed in this
chapter, Fe is essential for chlorophyll development
and function, assists in energy transfer functions
and redox reactions, is an important constituent of
enzymes and participates in nitrogen ﬁxation. Zinc is
important for carbohydrate and protein metabolism,
pollen formation, and general disease resistance, and
is a structural constituent or regulatory co-factor of
numerous plant enzymes. Molybdenum, Cu and Ni
each play additional important physiological roles in
plant nutrition, while excesses can lead to a variety of
toxic effects on plant vitality. Using the stable iso-
topes of these metals as indicators of metal sources
and cycling processes, and perhaps to reveal the
onset of metal toxicity, is an emerging ﬁeld in isotope
biogeoscience.
An area of applied research where transition and
As pointed out by von Blanckenburg et al. (2009),
post-transition metal stable isotopes are increasingly
being used is to understand sedimentary and low tem-
perature hydrothermal metal redox cycling, where
both inorganic and biological redox processes can
cause isotope fractionation. For example, Asael et al.
(2007) used Cu stable isotopes to understand Cu redox
cycling and mass transfer functions during sequential
the metabolic processes that control the behavior
of metals in plants can be envisaged as a gigantic
geochemical pump that continuously moves metals

The results of two studies of Fe isotope variability
fractionation. During the past several years, for the
metals discussed here stable isotope fractionation in
higher plants has been demonstrated for Fe and Zn
(Weiss et al. 2005; Guelke and von Blanckenburg
2007; Viers et al. 2007; Moynier et al. 2008; Kiczka
et al. 2010). This is an intriguing pair of metals to
consider, as the isotope fractionations observed in
plants are largely controlled by redox status for Fe,
and by complexation chemistry for Zn.
Plants have developed two different strategies
for transporting Fe from soils into roots. Roots of
dicotyledons and nongraminaceous monocotyledons
(“strategy I plants”, e.g. pea, bean) release protons
into the rhizosphere, promoting dissolution of Fe(III)
precipitates, and activating membrane-bound enzymes
that reduce chelate-bound Fe(III). The reduced Fe is
then transported across the root plasma membrane by
unspeciﬁc metal transporters (Briat et al. 2007). Partial
reduction of an Fe(III)-solid produces aqueous Fe(II)
with an 56Fe/54Fe ratio that is approximately 1–1.5‰
less than that in the remaining Fe(III)-solid (Johnson
et al. 2004). As a consequence, the Fe(II) that crosses
the root plasma membrane, and thus the pool of Fe in
a strategy I plant, is lighter than the soil Fe pool.
In contrast, roots of graminaceous plant species
(“strategy II plants”, e.g. maize, wheat) can release
phytosiderophores into the rhizosphere, which form
complexes with Fe(III) (Romheld and Marschner
1986; Kraemer et al. 2006). These Fe(III)-complexes
are then transported across the root plasma membrane
by a specialized class of transport proteins, but due to
in plants are shown in Fig. 10.6. In a variety of strategy
I plants studied by Guelke and von Blanckenburg
(2007), d56/54Fe values of tissues decreased from
soils to stems, from stems to leaves and from leaves
to seeds. In contrast, all tissues in their strategy II
plants had similar d56/54Fe values, which they attrib-
uted to differences in the way that Fe is translocated in
the two plant types. These results are consistent with
the different Fe uptake and transport processes pro-
posed above for strategy I and strategy II plants.
Kiczka et al. (2010), working with strategy I and II
plants collected from a recently deglaciated site, iden-
tiﬁed several reaction points along the translocation
stream of both plant types where Fe(III) reduction and
thus isotope fractionation might occur, including
between the root symplast and apoplast, between the
leaf cytoplasm and the xylem, and between the phloem
and the leaf cytoplasm, at each step moving lighter Fe
along the transpiration stream. However, in contrast to
the results of Guelke and von Blanckenburg (2007),
Kiczka et al. (2010) observed similar Fe isotope pat-
terns in their strategy I and II plants, with d56/54Fe
values generally increasing from root stele to stem
to leaf. To explain this discrepancy, they pointed to
previous studies suggesting that release of sidero-
phores by strategy II plants into the rhizosphere is
suppressed under Fe-rich soil conditions similar to
demonstrate the large Fe isotope fractionation that occurs across
the plasma membrane. Complex Fe isotope variations within
individual plants result from a variety of possible isotope frac-
tionation processes which can occur along the transpiration
stream

those at their ﬁeld site (Marschner 1995), and suggest-
ing that strategy I and II plants mobilize and transport
Fe similarly under such conditions (Charlson and
Shoemaker 2006).
In the case of Zn, dissolution of Fe(III) solids in the
or multi-tracer tests that could be applied to a natural
system to decipher a biological inﬂuence on its origins.
A recurring theme in metal stable isotope studies of
biological systems is that biological activities that result
in signiﬁcant isotope fractionation generally involve
preferential processing of lighter isotopes from the
metal source pool into and within the biological materi-
als (e.g. Zhu et al. 2002; Bermin et al. 2006; Johnson
et al. 2008; Eisenhauer et al. 2009). Indeed, in the early
days of the transition and post-transition metal stable
isotope data explosion (i.e. the late 1990s), the general
thinking was that most metal stable isotope fraction-
ation observed in nature would be due to biological
processing (e.g. Beard and Johnson 1999). This think-
ing led to pioneering attempts to constrain experimen-
tally an Fe isotope biosignature (Beard et al. 1999),
but likewise inspired early attempts to demonstrate the
importance of inorganic processes that could fractionate
Fe isotopes both in the laboratory (e.g. Anbar et al.
2000) and in natural settings (e.g. Bullen et al. 2001).
We now realize that ranges of metal stable isotope
fractionation caused by inorganic processes can exceed
and overlap those produced by biological processing,
making development of robust metal stable isotope
biosignature tools a challenge but also an exceptional
research opportunity.
Given the early and persistent focus on the isotope
soil by protons released from plant roots results in
release of Zn that is adsorbed on the Fe(III) solids.
Subsequent uptake of Zn by roots depends only on the
induction of speciﬁc Zn transporters, which belong to
the same protein family as the Fe transporters (Kramer
et al. 2007). Likewise, the release of phytosidero-
phores beneﬁts the acquisition of Zn (Suzuki et al.
2006). Apparently the transport of Fe and Zn to plant
roots is closely linked. Zn isotope variability within
plants appears to be fairly straightforward and similar
for strategy I and strategy II plants, based on several
laboratory and ﬁeld based studies (Weiss et al. 2005;
Viers et al. 2007; Moynier et al. 2008). Roots tend
have the heaviest Zn, probably reﬂecting the preferen-
tial adsorption of heavy Zn onto the root and plaque
surfaces. However it should be noted that the possibil-
ity of Zn isotope contrast between the root cortex and
stele of plants has yet to be explored, as has been done
for Fe isotopes (Kiczka et al. 2010). Shoots have
similar to lesser d66/64Zn values than bulk roots, and
leaves invariably contain the lightest Zn in the plants.
These observations are consistent with light Zn iso-
topes being transported preferentially during nutrient
exchange along the cell walls of the xylem although it
is unclear at this stage whether this is a kinetic or an
equilibrium process (von Blanckenburg et al. 2009).
There clearly remains much to be done to under-
stand the causes of transition and post-transition metal
stable isotope fractionation in plants, and certainly the
remaining metals deserve at least a thorough recon-
naissance for a variety of plant species and ﬁeld
situations. To date, much of the work has aimed at
explaining observed variations of isotope composition
in terms of known plant processes. With greater under-
standing, future work will gradually shift toward using
the isotopes to identify as yet unknown or uncon-
strained processes in plants.
10.4.4 Biosignatures
systematics of Fe, it is not surprising that the greatest
progress toward development of a metal stable isotope
biosignature has been for Fe, at least for early Earth
environments. As stressed by Johnson et al. (2008), the
ﬂuxes of mobilized Fe must have been far greater in
the Archean and early Proterozoic because of the
enormous amount of Fe-rich sediments (e.g. banded
iron formations) that were deposited in that time span.
The Fe isotope compostion of those sediments is
highly variable compared to igneous rocks, implying
that the processes responsible for fractionating Fe
must have been especially active and variable in extent
during that time span. Because microbial dissimilatory
Fe reduction (DIR) appears to be the most important
process capable of producing large quantities of isoto-
pically light Fe, by an order of magnitude or more
compared to inorganic processes, DIR is likely to have
been the dominant process affecting Fe during that
time span.
In this case, the effectiveness of the Fe isotope
One of the most enduring hopes and goals of metal
stable isotope biogeochemistry is to be able to use the
isotopes as biosignatures, by developing either single
biosignature depended on knowledge of the relative
sizes of the reduced and oxidized Fe pools during early

materials. Arguably, much of the work that has been
done to date with the transition and post-transition
metal stable isotopes has resulted in a better under-
standing of the isotope systems themselves rather than
the materials that have been measured. Many observed
variations in isotope composition have been explained
in terms of well understood physical, chemical and
biological processes, but isotope analyses have so far
rarely revealed some unanticipated or poorly under-
stood set of processes. On the other hand, useful
applications

studies
Earth history. If we are going to be able to use Fe
isotopes to detect a record of DIR in other environ-
ments (e.g. in the search for life on Mars and other
planetary bodies), we must be able to assess the size of
those pools in those environments as well. Conﬁdence
in the approach will increase as more terrestrial ﬁeld
sites are studied. A promising example from modern
Earth comes from the work of Severmann et al.
(2008), who used Fe isotopes to support their conten-
tion that DIR coupled to Fe(II) oxidation in oxic shelf
sediments can account for the large amount of isotopi-
cally light Fe produced on the shelf and shuttled to the
euxinic basin of the Black Sea.
Biosignatures based on the other transition and post-
are beginning to emerge: isotopic characteristics of
plant homeostasis are being established, multi-tracer
approaches for identifying metal sources are being
developed, biosignatures are being rigorously con-
strained through analysis of well understood geo-
logical and biological materials, and the isotopic
signatures of redox reactions are being characterized.
As understanding of metal stable isotope systematics
increases, it will become easier to think of novel ways
that isotopes can enhance understanding of complex
processes in environmental systems.
What should be clear from this chapter is that the
ﬁeld of transition and post-transition metal stable
isotope biogeochemistry is really just beginning to
mature, and that opportunities are abundant. Major
advances over the next several years are likely to
include: improving the routine precision and reproduc-
ibility of total procedural replicate measurements of
samples to the few hundredths of a per mil level;
developing robust multi-tracer approaches to identify
metal sources and pathways for forensic purposes;
looking for the unexpected isotope fractionation of
metals such as Ti and Ni in environmental systems;
expanding the list of robust biosignatures, including
the ﬁngerprint of anthropogenic activities; exploring
the metal stable isotope signals of global climate
change. This is only a partial list, but one where
success is likely to be realized through well-crafted
interdisciplinary efforts, careful selection of ﬁeld sites,
and clever laboratory- and ﬁeld-based experiments.
transition metal isotope systems have yet to be explored
as deeply as that based on Fe, but there are promising
signs for success. For example, Borrok et al. (2008)
documented a diel cycle for dissolved Zn concentra-
tions and d66/64Zn values in Prickly Pear Creek, which
drains a former mining district in the Boulder Batholith,
Montana, USA. They found that dissolved Zn concen-
trations and d66/64Zn values were inversely correlated,
with Zn at low concentrations in the daytime having
elevated d66/64Zn due to sequestration of light Zn in bed
sediments. Biological uptake of light Zn was invoked to
explain this relationship, since adsorption of Zn onto
amorphous Fe(III) oxides prevalent in bed sediments
preferentially concentrates heavy Zn onto sorption sites
(Balistrieri et al. 2008). As discussed above, Cameron
et al. (2009) demonstrated that methanogenic bacteria
cultured in the laboratory preferentially assimilate and
retain isotopically light Ni, while a wide range of geo-
logic materials have uniform Ni isotope composition.
Nickel isotopes are thus likely to become an important
biosignature of methanogenesis. And, as pointed out by
von Blanckenburg et al. (2009), plant tissues recycled
into soil generally have different metal stable isotope
composition than the growth medium, thus the upper soil
may retain a time-integrated metal isotope ﬁngerprint
of plant activity. New biosignatures are likely to emerge
as well understood biological systems are studied.
