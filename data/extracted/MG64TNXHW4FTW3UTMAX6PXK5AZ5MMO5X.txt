Trusting Spirit Rescues Horses, aided by South Douglas CD
Tuesday, 04 March 2008

Abandoned horses in Douglas County have a friend, or, as some might say, a guardian angel, in the form of Claudia
Trapp, of Orondo, Washington. Claudia has created Trusting Spirit Horse Rescue, a non-profit organization aimed at
caring for neglected and unwanted horses.�
�
�
She currently has 24 horses at her farm in Orondo, many who came from one owner who could no longer care for them.�
Claudia and other volunteers nurse the horses back to health and then seek good matches for those ready to move on to
a new home.�
�
�
To meet the need for a horse rescue in North Central Washington, Claudia and her husband, Larry, removed orchard
trees that were no longer productive, and used�
the space to begin developing corrals and shelters.�
Much of the work is done by volunteers who care for the horses, help build lean-tos, and provide compassionate human
contact for these neglected animals.�
�
�
A great partner for Trusting Spirit is the South Douglas Conservation District.�
This coming spring, the South Douglas Conservation District will provide technical assistance and cost-share funds to
help Claudia renovate and seed her pasture, cross fence for better pasture management, change from orchard hand
lines to pastureland irrigation, plant a windbreak, and develop a livestock confinement area.�
Like all 47 conservation districts in Washington State, the South Douglas Conservation District assists private
landowners with their voluntary conservation projects.�
