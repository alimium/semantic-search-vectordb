reaching that conclusion. If an action 
would result in such an alteration or 
such burdens, the Board shall take any 
other action that would not result in 
such an alteration or such burdens but 
would nevertheless ensure that individ-
uals with a disability receive the bene-
fits and services of the program or ac-
tivity. 
(b) Methods. The Board may comply 
with the requirements of this subpart 
H through such means as redesign of 
equipment, reassignment of services to

assignment 
of 
aides to individuals with a disability, 
home visits, delivery of service at al-
ternate accessible sites, alteration of 
existing facilities and construction of 
new facilities, use of accessible rolling 
stock, or any other methods that re-
sult in making its programs or activi-
ties readily accessible to and usable by 
individuals 
with 
a 
disability. 
The 
Board is not required to make struc-
tural changes in existing facilities 
where other methods are effective in 
achieving compliance with this sec-
tion. In choosing among available 
methods for meeting the requirements 
of this section, the Board shall give 
priority to those methods that offer 
programs and activities to qualified in-
dividuals with a disability in the most 
integrated setting appropriate.

tions established under this section as

program or activity, when viewed in its 
entirety, is readily accessible to and 
usable by individuals with a disability. 
This paragraph (a) does not: 
(1) Necessarily require the Board to 
make each of its existing facilities ac-
cessible to and usable by individuals 
with a disability; or 
(2) Require the Board to take any ac-
tion that it can demonstrate would re-
sult in a fundamental alteration in the 
nature of a program or activity or in 
undue financial and administrative 
burdens. In those circumstances where

action would fundamentally alter the 
program or activity or would result in 
undue financial and administrative 
burdens, the Board has the burden of 
proving that compliance with this 
paragraph (a) would result in such al-
terations or burdens. The decision that 
compliance would result in such alter-
ations or burdens shall be made by the 
Board of Governors or their designee 
after considering all Board resources 
available for use in the funding and op-
eration of the conducted program or 
activity, and must be accompanied by
