UPON DUE CONSIDERATION, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED

AND DECREED that the judgment of the district court be

Dawn Nguyen appeals from the judgment of the United
9
States District Court for the Western District of New York
10
(Larimer, J.) convicting her of (i) making false statements
11
in connection with the acquisition of a firearm, (ii)
12
disposing of a firearm to a convicted felon, and (iii)
13
possessing firearms as a drug user.  Nguyen was sentenced
14
chiefly to 96 months’ imprisonment.  Nguyen challenges the
15
reasonableness of her sentence.  We assume the parties’
16
familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural
17
history, and the issues presented for review. 
18
19
1.  We review a sentence for procedural reasonableness
20
under a “deferential abuse-of-discretion standard.”  Gall v.
21
United States, 552 U.S. 38, 41 (2007).  That means a
22
district court’s application of the Sentencing Guidelines is
23
reviewed de novo and its factual findings are reviewed for
24
clear error.  United States v. Cossey, 632 F.3d 82, 86 (2d
25
Cir. 2011).  A sentence is procedurally unreasonable if the
26
district court “fails to calculate (or improperly
27
calculates) the Sentencing Guidelines range, treats the
28
Sentencing Guidelines as mandatory, fails to consider the §
29
3553(a) factors, selects a sentence based on clearly
30
erroneous facts, or fails adequately to explain the chosen
31
sentence.”  United States v. Aldeen, 792 F.3d 247, 251 (2d
32
Cir. 2015) (quoting United States v. Chu, 714 F.3d 742, 746
33
(2d Cir. 2013)).  When a district court deviates from the
34
Sentencing Guidelines range, “it must consider the extent of
35
the deviation and ensure that the justification is
36
sufficiently compelling to support the degree of the
37
variance.”  Id. at 252 (internal quotation marks and
38
citations omitted).
39
40
Nguyen fails to establish that the district court
41
committed any procedural error.  The district court
42
appropriately weighed the factors laid out in § 3553(a) and
43
reasonably determined that the Sentencing Guidelines did not
44
sufficiently account for the severity of Nguyen’s conduct
45
and culpability.  See United States v. Gilmore, 599 F.3d
46
160, 169 (2d Cir. 2010).  As a result, the district court
47
2
considered whether an upward departure pursuant to §§ 5K2.1
1
(“death”) and 5K2.2 (“significant physical injury”) was
2
necessary.  Death and significant physical injury
3
unquestionably resulted from Nguyen’s crimes.  Coupling this
4
fact with the finding that Nguyen acted “recklessly” in
5
providing firearms to Spengler — whom she knew to be a
6
mentally unstable, convicted violent felon who mused aloud
7
about killing his sister — provided the district court with
8
a sufficient basis to invoke an upward departure under §§
9
5K2.1 and 5K2.2.  See, e.g., United States v. Aitchison, 411
10
Fed. App’x 358, 360-61 (2d Cir. 2011).  
11
12
Contrary to Nguyen’s argument, the enhancements in §§
13
2K2.1(b)(6)(B) and 2K2.1(c) do not mean that all of the
14
circumstances of her offense were adequately taken into
15
consideration in determining the guidelines range, such that
16
departure was not warranted under §§ 5K2.1 and 5K2.2.  The
17
particulars of her offense, such as the multiple deaths and
18
injuries that resulted (both deemed relevant under §§ 5K2.1
19
and 5K2.2), and the mayhem and massive property destruction,
20
authorize departure beyond the § 2K2.1 enhancements, under
21
the provisions of § 5K2.
22
23
Nguyen’s challenge to the district court’s factual
24
findings similarly fails.  Based on the evidence presented
25
in the pre-sentence report and at the sentencing hearing,
26
the district court had a more than adequate basis for
27
finding that (i) the firearm Spengler used to shoot the
28
firefighters was one that Nguyen had provided him, and (ii)
29
Nguyen believed Spengler to be “crazy.”  
30
31
2.  Our review of the substantive reasonableness of a
32
sentence is “particularly deferential”: we will set aside
33
sentences as substantively unreasonable “only in exceptional
34
cases where the trial court’s decision cannot be located
35
within the range of permissible decisions”; that is, where
36
the sentence “shocks the conscience,” “constitutes a
37
manifest injustice,” or “allowing [it] to stand would damage
38
the administration of justice.”  Aldeen, 792 F.3d at 255
39
(internal quotation marks and citations omitted).
40
41
The district court had sound reasons to deviate upward
42
from the Sentencing Guidelines range.  Nguyen (i) knew that
43
Spengler had previously been convicted of killing his
44
grandmother with a hammer, (ii) knew that Spengler had
45
voiced an intent to kill his sister, (iii) believed Spengler
46
to be “crazy,” and (iv) lied to police about being a straw
47
3
man purchaser for Spengler.  Thus, Nguyen’s conduct falls
1
well outside the heartland of straw man purchase cases.  On
2
this record, the district court’s sentence of 96 months’
3
imprisonment is “within the range of permissible decisions.” 
4
Id.
5
6
Accordingly, and finding no merit in Nguyen’s other
7
arguments, we hereby AFFIRM the judgment of the district
8
court.
