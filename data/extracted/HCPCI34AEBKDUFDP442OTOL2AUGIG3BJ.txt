Flammability And Mechanical Properties Of Polymer Composites 
R.N. Walters and R.E. Lyon, FAA 
The flammability and flexural strength of fiber-reinforced thermoset resin structural composites 
for use in aircraft and Navy ships were evaluated. Several different commercial and high 
performance resins as well as a toughened aerospace composite were tested. Processing 
characteristics, thermal stability, and flammability of the neat resins were measured using 
rheometry, thermogravimetry, and pyrolysis-combustion flow calorimetry, respectively. 
Structural laminates were made from liquid resins and woven glass fabric by vacuum-assisted 
resin transfer molding (VARTM). Single-layer specimens (lamina) for flammability testing were 
prepared by hand lay-up. Mechanical properties of the laminates were measured in three-point 
bending according to ASTM-D790. Fire behavior of the lamina and laminates was measured in 
the OSU and cone calorimeters according to Federal Aviation Regulation FAR 25.853(a-1) and 
military standard MIL-STD-2031. Results for the flammability and mechanical properties of 
these composites will be presented.
