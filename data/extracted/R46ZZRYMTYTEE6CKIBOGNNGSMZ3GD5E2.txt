We do not expect any recoverable DWH oil to appear in the offshore environment.  However, observations will continue into the foreseeable future.  If the need arises,
surface oil trajectories will be produced again.  Periods of onshore winds may result in some scattered tarball impacts for the next few weeks to months.
No recoverable oil has been reported by daily overflights since July 30.  Daily satellite analyses have indicated a decreasing number of possible oil anomalies since the
well has been capped.  Recent overflights sent to investigate satellite anomalies have only reported seeing seaweed with an occasional colorless sheen.
