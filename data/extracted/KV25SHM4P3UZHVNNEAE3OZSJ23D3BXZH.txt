Section B: Investment Detail
1.  Briefly describe the investment’s purpose, goals, and current or anticipated benefits
(quantitative and/or qualitative). Include the investment’s specific contribution to
mission delivery or agency management support functions and identify key customers,
stakeholders, and other beneficiaries.
 The Modernize and Innovate the Delivery of Agricultural Systems (MIDAS) program will
transform Farm Service Agency's (FSA) delivery of Farm Program benefits, on behalf of the
Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC), into a 21st century business model. This project will
provide capability to meet the increasing demand for customer self-service and eliminate
FSA's reliance on aging technology. This project will reduce the risk of hardware failure by
replacing the farm program applications residing on the outdated AS400/S36 computing
platform with an integrated COTS solution, SAP. This project will reengineer business
processes to be common and centralize data assets to support farm programs, eliminate
program specific duplication of functionality and non-integrated, distributed data that exists
between farm program software applications. It will accomplish increased compliance with
modern internal control structures and effectively implement improved IT security. MIDAS will
install commitment-based accounting practices (e.g., obligations, commitments, outlays,
funds control) to upgrade both the program and financial management business practices of
the CCC. The project is intended to align with Office of the Chief Financial Officer's (OCFO)
Financial Management Modernization Initiative (FMMI) investment.
2.  Briefly describe how the investment contributes to the agency target EA and its role
in the Enterprise Roadmap. Include a description of how the investment includes or
will achieve programmatic or technical innovation. 
 MIDAS is aligned with USDA Target Enterprise Architecture. The USDA EA Division (EAD) is
creating an initial Enterprise Roadmap where MIDAS will be explicitly named and highlighted
as one of the most important IT investments for USDA. MIDAS can be considered to be well
aligned with the USDA Target Enterprise Architecture.  MIDAS is aligned with USDA

2010-2015 Strategic Plan.  Initiative IV: Leverage USDA Departmental Management to
Increase Performance, Efficiency, and Alignment  - MIDAS will help to reduce Improper
Payments through an integrated solution that will streamline the payment process and reduce
human errors. - MIDAS will leverage streamlined operations of FMMI to disburse payments. 
Initiative V: Optimize Information Technology (IT) Policy and Applications - MIDAS will
leverage the latest technology to improve and support program delivery of services, benefits
and communication - MIDAS will implement an integrated COTS solution providing a secured
and robust delivery platform for Farm Benefit Programs  MIDAS is aligned with Farm Service
Agency (FSA) 2012-2016 Strategic Plan.  Strategic Goal 4: Transform and modernize the
Farm Service Agency As stated in FSA Strategic Plan 2012-2016, the FSA is transforming its
systems and applications into a set of enterprise services and eliminating legacy systems,
servers, and duplicative data environments. Achieving the goal of transforming and
modernizing key systems, business processes, and support activities will facilitate mission
success and enhance the accountability, efficiency, and effectiveness of service delivery. 
Objective 4.3: Modernize Program and Service Delivery MIDAS will allow FSA to respond
more promptly to customer demands and meet future challenges. MIDAS will enable an
access program and financial management data to ensure strategic decisions are based on
valid data. Increased online access will enhance customer self-sufficiency and usability,
reducing field office trips, transaction processing, data entry, and paperwork.  Objective 4.4:
Improve Customer Service MIDAS will improve the customer service capabilities and allow
FSA to use analytics to evaluate the consistency of customer service. MIDAS will expand
beyond the traditional walk-in local offices and ensure that customers are aware of available
eservices and that these services are easy to use. MIDAS will review and improve business
processes to ensure we are effectively delivering our programs and services.
