Red 
No. 
36 
is 
1-[(2-chloro-4-
nitrophenyl)azo]-2-naphthalenol 
(CAS 
Reg. No. 2814–77–9). The color additive 
is manufactured by diazotization of 2-
chloro-4-nitrobenzenamine in acid me-
dium and coupling with 2-naphthalenol 
in acid medium. 
(2) Color additive mixtures for drug 
use made with D&C Red No. 36 may 
contain only those diluents that are 
suitable and that are listed in part 73 
of this chapter as safe for use in color 
additive mixtures for coloring drugs. 
(b) Specifications. D&C Red No. 36 
shall conform to the following speci-
fications and shall be free from impuri-
ties other than those named to the ex-
tent that such impurities may be 
avoided by current good manufacturing 
practice:
(a) Identity. (1) The color additive 
D&C Red No. 39 is o-[p(b,b′-dihydroxy-
diethylamino)-phenylazo]-benzoic acid. 
(2) Color additive mixtures made 
with D&C Red No. 39 may contain the 
following diluents: Water, acetone, iso-
propyl alcohol, and specially denatured 
alcohols used in accordance with 26 
CFR part 212. 
(b) Specifications. D&C Red No. 39 
shall conform to the following speci-
fications and shall be free from impuri-
ties other than those named to the ex-
tent that such other impurities may be 
avoided by good manufacturing prac-
tice:
Volatile matter (at 100 °C.), not more than 
2.0 percent. 
Volatile matter at 135 °C (275 °F), not more 
than 1.5 percent. 
Matter insoluble in toluene, not more than 
1.5 percent. 
2-Chloro-4-nitrobenzenamine, not more than 
0.3 percent. 
2-Naphthalenol, not more than 1 percent.

percent. 
1-[(2,4-Dinitrophenyl)azo]-2-naphthalenol,
