doing business at the following address:
                                                                                                                                                                                      
Our subcontract with UT-Battelle, LLC, does not require us to receive, store, transmit, or originate classified information
within our facility (ies).  Our personnel will, however, have authorized access to classified information at approved DOE
facility(ies).  The DOE security clearances granted our personnel have been issued by DOE ORO for work within DOE ORO
facilities.
We understand that we will be responsible for ensuring that the following security requirements are met:
Initial, Comprehensive, and Annual Refresher briefings are conducted and documented as required by DOE Order
470.1.   SF-312, Classified Information Nondisclosure Agreement Form, is signed and processed prior to any access
to classified information. 
Termination briefings are conducted and documented in accordance with DOE Order 470.1 for all cleared personnel
leaving our employment, losing their clearances, or no longer requiring a clearance.  Termination statements are
forwarded to ORO through UT-Battelle, LLC, if applicable.  DOE badges are recovered from employees and
returned to the issuing badge office.  Unrecovered and lost badges are reported to the issuing badge office. 
DOE is notified 45 days in advance of any planned foreign travel to sensitive countries by DOE-cleared individuals.
 Foreign travel briefings and debriefings are conducted as required.
Assistance is provided for personnel security clearance requests to ensure accurate completion.  Provisions of the
Privacy Act are met when handling and mailing/delivering completed personnel security clearance request
documents. 
Cleared personnel are informed of and comply with the personnel clearance reporting requirements.
All DOE Government property in our possession is protected in accordance with DOE 5632.1C-1, Protection and
Control of Safeguards and Security Interests, of 7/15/94 and DOE Manual 5632.1C-1, Change 1, of April 10, 1996.
 A property control security plan is developed and sent to DOE for formal approval, if we become responsible for
more than $5 million in Government property.
Any subcontractor, subbidder, individual, or organization that will provide supplies or services involving access to
classified information, must have the appropriate DOE facility clearance.
Foreign national employees are not placed in positions to exercise control or influence over properly cleared U.S.
citizens who have been granted access to DOE classified information or significant quantities of special nuclear
material.
Reporting requirements of the clause, DOE Acquisition Regulation (DEAR) 952.204-74, “Foreign ownership,
control, or influence over contractor,” are complied with.
If automatic data processing (ADP) functions with DOE or DOE contractor information are to be performed, ADP
systems and processes are documented and approved as required by DOE Order.
Procedures are developed describing our internal processes for accomplishing each of the items above.  Personnel
are informed of their individual responsibilities in executing and supporting these procedures. 
Employees will be familiar and comply with security procedures at sites where classified work is being performed.
We understand that designated representatives of DOE are required to inspect every five years the procedures,
methods, and facilities used by nonpossessing facilities in complying with DOE Orders.  We shall assist by
providing necessary documentation for review.  Should DOE, through its authorized representative, determine that
our security methods, procedures, or facilities do not comply, DOE shall submit a written report to us advising of
the deficiencies.
