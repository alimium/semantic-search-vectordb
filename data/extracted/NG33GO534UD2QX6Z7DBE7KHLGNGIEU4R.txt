The Proposed Amendment 
Accordingly, under the authority 
delegated to me by the Administrator, 
the FAA proposes to amend 14 CFR part 
39 as follows: 
PART 39—AIRWORTHINESS 
DIRECTIVES 
1. The authority citation for part 39 
continues to read as follows: 
Authority: 49 U.S.C. 106(g), 40113, 44701. 
§ 39.13
[Amended] 
2. The FAA amends § 39.13 by adding 
the following new AD: 
Grob-Werke Gmbh & Co Kg: Docket No. 
FAA–2007–28670; Directorate Identifier 
2007–CE–060–AD. 
Comments Due Date 
(a) We must receive comments by October 
19, 2007. 
SUMMARY: The FAA proposes to adopt a 
new airworthiness directive (AD) for 
certain McDonnell Douglas Model DC– 
9–81 (MD–81) and DC–9–82 (MD–82) 
airplanes. This proposed AD would 
require, for certain airplanes, inspecting 
for cracking of the fuselage skin at the 
upper corners of the forward passenger 
doorjamb, installing or replacing 
doublers as applicable, and doing 
applicable repairs. This proposed AD 
results from reports of fatigue cracking 
in the fuselage skin at the upper corners 
of the forward passenger doorjamb. We 
are proposing this AD to prevent 
cracking of the fuselage skin at the 
upper corners of the forward passenger 
doorjamb, which could lead to loss of 
overall structural integrity of the 
airplane. 
Affected ADs 
(b) None. 
DATES: We must receive comments on 
this proposed AD by November 5, 2007. 
Applicability 
(c) This AD applies to the gliders Model 
G102 CLUB ASTIR III, serial numbers (SNs) 
5501 (suffix C) through 5652 (suffix C); 
Model G102 CLUB ASTIR IIIb, SNs 5501 
(suffix Cb) through 5652 (suffix Cb); and 
Model G102 STANDARD ASTIR III, SNs 
5501 (suffix S) through 5652 (suffix S), that 
are certificated in any category. 
Other FAA AD Provisions 
(g) The following provisions also apply to 
this AD: 
(1) Alternative Methods of Compliance 
(AMOCs): The Manager, Standards Office, 
FAA, has the authority to approve AMOCs 
for this AD, if requested using the procedures 
found in 14 CFR 39.19. Send information to

329–4090. Before using any approved AMOC 
on any airplane to which the AMOC applies, 
notify your appropriate principal inspector 
(PI) in the FAA Flight Standards District 
Office (FSDO), or lacking a PI, your local 
FSDO. 
(2) Airworthy Product: For any 
requirement in this AD to obtain corrective 
actions from a manufacturer or other source, 
use these actions if they are FAA-approved. 
Corrective actions are considered FAA- 
approved if they are approved by the State 
of Design Authority (or their delegated 
agent). You are required to assure the product 
is airworthy before it is returned to service. 
(3) Reporting Requirements: For any 
reporting requirement in this AD, under the 
provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
We have evaluated all pertinent 
information and identified an unsafe 
condition that is likely to exist or 
develop on other airplanes of this same 
type design. For this reason, we are 
proposing this AD, which would require 
accomplishing the actions specified in 
the service information described 
previously, except as discussed under 
‘‘Differences Between Proposed AD and 
Alert Service Bulletin.’’ 
Differences Between Proposed AD and 
Alert Service Bulletin 
For all airplanes, the alert service 
bulletin specifies to contact the 
manufacturer for instructions on how to 
repair certain conditions, but this 
proposed AD would require repairing 
those conditions in one of the following 
ways: 
• Using a method that we approve; or 
• Using data that meet the 
certification basis of the airplane, and 
that have been approved by an 
Authorized Representative for the 
Boeing Commercial Airplanes 
Delegation Option Authorization 
Organization whom we have authorized 
to make those findings. 
For airplane configuration 4: Where 
the alert service bulletin specifies to 
contact the manufacturer for repair 
instructions before further flight, to 
avoid unnecessarily grounding 
airplanes, this proposed AD would 
require performing repairs within 90 
days after the effective date of this 
proposed AD. 
Costs of Compliance 
Comments Invited 
We invite you to submit any relevant 
written data, views, or arguments 
regarding this proposed AD. Send your 
comments to an address listed in the 
ADDRESSES section. Include the docket 
number ‘‘FAA–2007–29226; Directorate 
Identifier 2006–NM–256–AD’’ at the 
beginning of your comments. We 
specifically invite comments on the 
overall regulatory, economic, 
environmental, and energy aspects of 
the proposed AD. We will consider all 
comments received by the closing date 
and may amend the proposed AD in 
light of those comments. 
We will post all comments we 
receive, without change, to http:// 
dms.dot.gov, including any personal 
information you provide. We will also 
post a report summarizing each 
substantive verbal contact with FAA 
personnel concerning this proposed AD. 
Using the search function of that Web 
site, anyone can find and read the 
comments in any of our dockets, 
including the name of the individual 
who sent the comment (or signed the 
comment on behalf of an association, 
business, labor union, etc.). You may 
review DOT’s complete Privacy Act 
Statement in the Federal Register 
published on April 11, 2000 (65 FR 
19477–78), or you may visit http:// 
dms.dot.gov. 
There are about 76 airplanes of the 
affected design in the worldwide fleet. 
This proposed AD would affect about 46 
airplanes of U.S. registry. The following 
table provides the estimated costs for 
U.S. operators to comply with this 
proposed AD, at an average labor rate of 
$80 per work hour. The proposed 
actions vary depending upon the 
airplane configuration. 
We have reviewed Boeing Alert 
Service Bulletin MD80–53A298, dated 
August 1, 2006. The alert service 
bulletin describes procedures for a low- 
frequency eddy current (LFEC) or a 
high-frequency eddy current (HFEC) 
inspection, depending on airplane 
configuration, for cracking of the 
fuselage skin at the upper corners of the 
forward passenger doorjamb; and 
applicable corrective actions. The 
compliance time for the initial 
inspection is before accumulating 
37,500 total flight cycles, or within 
3,575 flight cycles (whichever is later). 
The corrective actions include: 
• For Group 1, Configuration 1, 
airplanes on which no cracking is 
found: Either repeating the LFEC 
inspection at intervals of 3,575 flight 
cycles; or installing external aluminum 
doublers within 3,575 flight cycles after 
the last inspection, and doing an HFEC 
inspection within 28,000 flight cycles 
after doing the installation, and 
repetitively at 20,000-flight-cycle 
intervals. 
• For Group 1, Configuration 1, 
airplanes on which any crack is found 
that is 2.0 inches or shorter in length: 
Repair before further flight, and do an 
HFEC inspection within 28,000 flight 
cycles after the repair, and repetitively 
at 20,000-flight-cycle intervals. 
• For Group 1, Configuration 1, 
airplanes on which any crack is found 
that is longer than 2.0 inches; for Group 
1, Configurations 2 and 3, airplanes on 
which any crack is found beyond the 
edge of the doublers; and for Group 1, 
Configuration 4, airplanes: Contact 
Boeing for repair instructions before 
further flight. 
• For Group 1, Configuration 2, 
airplanes on which no crack is found 
beyond the edge of the steel doublers: 
Replace existing steel doublers with 
aluminum doublers, and repair upper 
corners within 6,000 flight cycles after

Authority for This Rulemaking 
The Proposed Amendment 
Accordingly, under the authority 
delegated to me by the Administrator, 
the FAA proposes to amend 14 CFR part 
39 as follows: 
PART 39—AIRWORTHINESS 
DIRECTIVES 
1. The authority citation for part 39 
continues to read as follows: 
forward passenger doorjamb; and do all 
applicable corrective actions (repetitive 
inspections, installation of doublers, 
replacements, and repairs), except as 
provided by paragraph (g) of this AD. Do the 
actions in accordance with the 
Accomplishment Instructions of the alert 
service bulletin. Where the alert service 
bulletin specifies a compliance time after the 
date on the service bulletin, this AD requires 
compliance within the specified compliance 
time after the effective date of this AD. 
Authority: 49 U.S.C. 106(g), 40113, 44701. 
Repair of Certain Conditions 
§ 39.13
[Amended] 
2. The Federal Aviation 
Administration (FAA) amends § 39.13 
by adding the following new 
airworthiness directive (AD): 
McDonnell Douglas: Docket No. FAA–2007– 
29226; Directorate Identifier 2006–NM– 
256–AD. 
(g) If any crack is found during any 
inspection required by paragraph (f) of this 
AD and Boeing Alert Service Bulletin MD80– 
53A298, dated August 1, 2006, specifies to 
contact Boeing for repair instructions: Before 
further flight, repair using a method 
approved in accordance with the procedures 
specified in paragraph (i) of this AD. 
Corrective Action for Configuration 4 
Airplanes 
Comments Due Date 
(a) The FAA must receive comments on 
this AD action by November 5, 2007. 
Title 49 of the United States Code 
specifies the FAA’s authority to issue 
rules on aviation safety. Subtitle I, 
Section 106, describes the authority of 
the FAA Administrator. Subtitle VII, 
Aviation Programs, describes in more 
detail the scope of the Agency’s 
authority. 
We are issuing this rulemaking under 
the authority described in Subtitle VII, 
Part A, Subpart III, Section 44701, 
‘‘General requirements.’’ Under that 
section, Congress charges the FAA with 
promoting safe flight of civil aircraft in 
air commerce by prescribing regulations 
for practices, methods, and procedures 
the Administrator finds necessary for 
safety in air commerce. This regulation 
is within the scope of that authority 
because it addresses an unsafe condition 
that is likely to exist or develop on 
products identified in this rulemaking 
action. 
Regulatory Findings 
Affected ADs 
(b) None. 
(h) For airplanes identified as 
Configuration 4 in Boeing Alert Service 
Bulletin MD80–53A298, dated August 1, 
2006: Within 90 days after the effective date 
of this AD, repair using a method approved 
in accordance with the procedures specified 
in paragraph (i) of this AD. 
Applicability 
(c) This AD applies to McDonnell Douglas 
Model DC–9–81 (MD–81) and DC–9–82 (MD– 
82) airplanes; certificated in any category; as 
identified in Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 
MD80–53A298, dated August 1, 2006. 
Alternative Methods of Compliance 
(AMOCs) 
Unsafe Condition 
(d) This AD results from a report of fatigue 
cracking in the fuselage skin at the upper 
corners of the forward passenger doorjamb. 
We are issuing this AD to prevent cracking 
of the fuselage skin at the upper corners of 
the forward passenger doorjamb, which 
could lead to loss of overall structural 
integrity of the airplane. 
Compliance 
(e) You are responsible for having the 
actions required by this AD performed within 
the compliance times specified, unless the 
actions have already been done. 
We have determined that this 
proposed AD would not have federalism 
implications under Executive Order 
13132. This proposed AD would not 
have a substantial direct effect on the 
States, on the relationship between the 
national Government and the States, or 
on the distribution of power and 
responsibilities among the various 
levels of government. 
For the reasons discussed above, I 
certify that the proposed regulation: 
1. Is not a ‘‘significant regulatory 
action’’ under Executive Order 12866; 
2. Is not a ‘‘significant rule’’ under the 
DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures 
(44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and 
3. Will not have a significant 
economic impact, positive or negative, 
on a substantial number of small entities 
under the criteria of the Regulatory 
Flexibility Act. 
We prepared a regulatory evaluation 
of the estimated costs to comply with 
this proposed AD and placed it in the 
AD docket. See the ADDRESSES section 
for a location to examine the regulatory 
evaluation. 
List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 
Repetitive Inspections and Corrective 
Actions for Configuration 1, 2, and 3 
Airplanes 
(f) For airplanes identified as Configuration 
1, 2, or 3 in Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 
MD80–53A298, dated August 1, 2006: At the 
applicable times specified in paragraph 1.E., 
‘‘Compliance,’’ of the alert service bulletin, 
do a low-frequency eddy current (LFEC) or 
high-frequency eddy current (HFEC) 
inspection, as applicable, for cracking of the 
fuselage skin at the upper corners of the 
(i)(1) The Manager, Los Angeles Aircraft 
Certification Office (ACO), FAA, has the 
authority to approve AMOCs for this AD, if 
requested in accordance with the procedures 
found in 14 CFR 39.19. 
(2) To request a different method of 
compliance or a different compliance time 
for this AD, follow the procedures in 14 CFR 
39.19. Before using any approved AMOC on 
any airplane to which the AMOC applies, 
notify your appropriate principal inspector 
(PI) in the FAA Flight Standards District 
Office (FSDO), or lacking a PI, your local 
FSDO. 
(3) An AMOC that provides an acceptable 
level of safety may be used for any repair 
required by this AD, if it is approved by an 
Authorized Representative for the Boeing 
Commercial Airplanes Delegation Option 
Authorization Organization who has been 
authorized by the Manager, Los Angeles 
ACO, to make those findings. For a repair 
method to be approved, the repair must meet 
the certification basis of the airplane and 14

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
On June 30, 2004, we issued an 
NPRM, Docket No. FAA–2004–18583, to 
address the identified unsafe condition. 
That NPRM was prompted by reports 
from eight operators indicating that 
cracking of the lower forward corner 
reveal of the number 3 main entry doors 
(MEDs) was found on several Model 747 
airplanes. Of the twelve reveals that 
were cracked, eleven were made of cast 
356 aluminum and one was made of 
machined 6061 aluminum. The cause of 
the cracking of the reveals made of cast 
356 aluminum is fatigue. The cause of 
the cracking of the reveal made of 
machined 6061 aluminum was a 
manufacturing defect, which led to 
fatigue cracking. 
Subsequent to issuing the NPRM, we 
have been working with the 
manufacturer to ensure that the unsafe 
condition is adequately addressed and 
appropriate service instructions are 
available. We have also received new 
data showing other issues related to the 
unsafe condition. In addition to the 
comments received for that NPRM, the 
data include reports that forward corner 
reveals installed on certain airplanes 
have a ‘‘sharp edge’’ detail at the 
forward edge, which could lead to 
fatigue cracking, and that additional 
airplanes are affected by the identified 
unsafe condition. We have determined 
from these data that the corrective 
actions proposed by that NPRM are 
inadequate for addressing the identified 
unsafe condition; therefore, we have 
withdrawn that NPRM and are issuing 
this new proposed AD. 
SUMMARY: The FAA proposes to adopt a 
new airworthiness directive (AD) for 
certain Boeing Model 747–100, 747– 
100B, 747–100B SUD, 747–200B, 747– 
200C, 747–300, 747–400, 747–400D, and 
747SR series airplanes. For certain 
airplanes, this proposed AD would 
require a material type inspection to 
determine if the lower forward corner 
reveal of the number 3 main entry doors 
(MEDs) is a casting. If the reveals are 
castings, this proposed AD would 
require repetitive inspection of the 
reveals for cracking, and corrective 
action if necessary. If the reveals are not 
castings, this proposed AD would 
require a detailed inspection of the 
reveals for a sharp edge and repetitive 
inspection of the reveals for cracking, 
and corrective action if necessary. For 
certain other airplanes, this AD would 
require only a detailed inspection of the 
reveals for a sharp edge and repetitive 
inspection of the reveals for cracking, 
and corrective action if necessary. For 
certain other airplanes, this AD would 
require repetitive inspection of the 
reveals for cracking only, and corrective 
action if necessary. This proposed AD 
results from reports of cracking and/or 
a sharp edge in the lower forward corner 
reveal of the number 3 MEDs. We are 
proposing this AD to detect and correct 
fatigue cracking of the lower forward 
corner reveal of the number 3 MEDs, 
which could lead to the door escape 
slide departing from the airplane when 
the door is opened and the slide is 
deployed, and consequent injuries to
