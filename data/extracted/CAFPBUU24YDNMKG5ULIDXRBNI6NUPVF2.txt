Under a solicitation which called for the award of a
cost reimbursement contract, agency properly rejected
protester's proposal where, in response to the agency's
request for updated proposals, protester modified various
aspects of its cost proposal but failed to adequately
document the basis for its modifications,

Awardee's proposal complied with solicitation
requirement for submission of letters of intent from key
personnel where, although several individuals rescinded
their initial agreement that they would be available
exclusively to the awardee, they continued to indicate an
intention to work for the awardee if it was the successful
offeror.
DECISION
Pinkerton Security & Investigation Services protests the
Department of Energy's (DOE) selection of Essex Corporation
for award of a contract under request for proposals (RFP)
No. DE-RP04-91AL72307. The RFP sought proposals to operate
DOE's Transportation Safeguards Training Center in
Albuquerque, New Mexico. Pinkerton asserts that DOE
improperly evaluated Pinkerton's cost proposal and Essex's
technical proposal.
We deny the protest.

BACKGROUND
This RFP was issued on March 11, 1991, and contemplated
award of a cPntract to provide all personnel, facilities,
equipment, :..pplies, and services necessary to operate the
Transportation Safeguards Training Center, The solicitation
provided that proposals would be evaluated under the
following factors, listed in descending order of importance:
me.iagerial/operational, business experience and corporate
commitment, and cost.
Under the managerial/operational factor, the solicitation
identified certain key positions and provided that each
offeror must submit letters of intent from the personnel it
proposed to fill those positions, Regarding cost proposals,
the solicitation stated that proposals would be evaluated,
among other things, on the basis of; 
(1) "allowability,
allocability, reasonableness, and adequacy of the proposed
cost"; (2) "reasonableness and appropriateness of the
compensation proposed for employees"; and (3) "probable cost
to the Government." The solicitation expressly stated that
offerors must submit adequate documentation to support their
proposals and noted that unrealistic cost estimates could be
grounds for eliminating a proposal from the competition.
Initial proposals were submitted on April 19, 1991;
discussions were subsequently conducted, and each offeror
was asked to submit a "final revised proposal" by June 24.
On August 21, DOE selected Wackenhut Services, Inc. for
contract award, Thereafter, Essex filed a protest
challenging Wackenhut's selection. We sustained Essex's
protest on the basis that Wackenhut's proposal did not
contain letters of intent for most of the key personnel whom
Wackenhut proposed.2

'Although such submissions are usually referred to as "best
and final offers," here, DOE referred to them as "final
revised proposals"; our decision uses DOE's nomenclature.
2In our decision, we also found that, after Essex filed an
agency-level protest, certain documents related to
Wackenhut's proposal were altered to make it appear that
Wackenhut's proposal met the solicitation requirements.
3We subsequently denied Wackenhut's request for
reconsideration. Wackenhut Servs., Inc.--Recon.,

proposals needed to be updated due to the passage of time,
we recommended that DOE seek revisions only from offerors
whose proposals complied with the solicitation requirements,
The agency subsequently determined that only Pinkerton's and
Essex's final revised proposals complied with the
solicitation requirements. By letters dated September 4,
1992, DOE sought updated proposals from those offerors,
which Pinkerton and Essex submitted on October 5.
In evaluating Pinkerton's updated cost proposal, DOE
determined that Pinkerton had decreased virtually all of the
36 direct labor rates contained in its proposal by a uniform
amount, and also that Pinkerton had altered its labor
overhead rates,4
DOE also determined that Pinkerton's
updated proposal provided virtually no documentation
regarding the basis for its modified zates, 
In are effort to
assess the reasonableness and realism of Pinkerton's new
rates, DOE sought assistance from the Defense Contract Audit
Agency (DCAA), asking that DCAA review Pinkerton's proposal
and provide its opinion regarding the realism and
reasonableness of Pinkerton's proposed costs, DCAA
personnel subsequently reviewed Pinkerton's proposal at
Pinkerton's offices and discussed the proposal with
Pinkerton personnel, Upon completing its review, DCAA
stated that "(Pinkerton) did not provide any supporting
documentation to support the estimated labor rates," and
concluded that "(wje do not consider the proposal to be
acceptable as a basis Zor negotiation of a fair and
reasonable price. "'
Because of Pinkerton's failure to submit adequate
documentation regarding the rates first presented in its
updated proposal, DOE concluded it could not assess the
"probable cost to the government" with regard to Pinkerton's
proposal, as required by the solicitation.' DOE concluded
that it must either reopen discussions to obtain additional

proposals, we will not discuss the specific individual costs
associated with any of the offerors' proposals.
5In addition to Pinkerton's direct labor rates and labor
overhead rates, DCAA questioned the general and
administrative (G&A) rate which was contained in Pinkerton's
earlier and updated proposals. The DCAA auditors noted that
Pinkerton's actual G&A rate was substantially higher than
that included in Pinkerton's proposals.
'In evaluating the probable cost to the government regarding
Essex's proposal, DOE had upwardly adjusted Essex's proposed
costs.

information regarding Pinkerton's new rates, or reject
Pinkerton's proposal as unacceptable 
Upon consideration,
DOE rejected Pinkerton's proposal based on Pinkerton's
failure to adequately document its proposed costs, On
March 18, 1993, 
DOE selected Essex for award of a contract,
This protest followed.
DISCUSSION
Pinkerton first complains that DOE's evaluation of its cost
proposal was improper, arguing that DOE was obligated to
either accept Pinkerton's proposal on the basis of the new,
stated rates or reopen discussions with Pinkerton regarding
those rates.
DOE responds that the solicitation required offerors to
submit documentation supporting the specific costs coitained
in their proposals and specifically advised offerors that
unrealistic cost estimates could be grounds for eliminating
a proposal from the competition. DOE also notes that the
updated proposals were the third submission of both
offerors, 
E maintains that, since the defects in
Pinkerton's proposal first appeared in the updated proposal,
DOE was not required to discuss those detects with
Pinkerton,
In submitting proposal revisions, an offeror may change or
amend any aspect of its prior proposal; however, in doing
so, an offerors runs the risk that the changes may render a
previously acceptable proposal unacceptable. See, et&.,
Control Data Corp. and KET, Inc., 60 Comp. Gen. 548 (1981),
81-1 CPD $ 531; Federal Business Sys., Inc., B-246514,
Mar. 13, 1992, 92-1 CPD ¶ 283. 
In evaluating revised
proposals, a procuring agency is not obligated to reopen
discussions in order to remedy a defect introduced into a
previously acceptable proposal. RCA Serv. Co,, B-219643,
Nov. 18, 1985, 85-2 CPD c1 563.
We have reviewed the protest file in this matter and agree
that Pinkerton's updated proposal contained virtually no
documentation explaining and supporting the modified direct
labor and overhead rates that Pinkerton first introduced in
its updated proposal. Although Pinkerton asserts that the
lower direct labor rates were derived from interviews with
the various personnel it was intending to use in performing
the contract, its updated proposal contains no documentation
regarding such interviews, Further, the uniform nature of
the rate decreases is inconsistent with the assertion that
the reductions resulted from the individual input of
multiple potential employees.

In its comments on the agency report, Pinkerton states:
''(Cjomparison of the Essex and Pinkerton (updatedJ
proposals , 
, 
.
shows that a number of the
individual {direct labor) rates Pinkerton proposed
were lower than the rates Essex proposed for the
same positions (although Pinkerton's qualitatively
higher-ranked personnel slate would naturally cost
somewhat more than Essex's overall) ." 
(Emphasis
in original,)
Rather than supporting Pinkerton's assertion that the agency
had no basis to question its modified rates, this comment
highlights DOE's legitimate concern regarding the realism of
the Pinkerton's proposed personnel costs, since it suggests
that Pinkerton might have been proposing more highly skilled
personnel at unrealistically low rates,
As noted above, the solicitation specifically provided that
cost proposals must be evaluated on the basis of
"reasonableness and appropriateness of the compensation
proposed for employees" and "probable cost to the
government," Clearly, under the terms of the solicitation,
DOE was obligated to assess whether Pinkerton's new rates
were reasonable and realistic and, in the event DOE
concludec they were not, to determine what the probable
costs under Pinkerton's proposal would likely be. 
In
submitting an updated proposal which modified various cost
elements with little or no documentation, Pinkerton failed
to comply with the solicitation requirement that proposals
include adequate documentation to support proposed costs.
DOE was thus justified in finding that it could not conclude
that Pinkerton's revised costs were reasonable or calculate
the probable actual cost to the government. On this record,
the agency reasonably rejected Pinkerton's updated proposal.
Pinkerton also protests that DOE's selection of Essex was
improper because Essex's proposal failed to comply with the
solicitation requirement regarding submission of letters of
intent for key personnel. The solicitation required that
letters of intent be submitted for 15 key personnel in
9 different labor categories. Pinkertonf asserts that
Essex's proposal should have been rejected as failing to
meet the letter-of-intent requirement for two specific
individuals that Essex proposed as key personnel. Pinkerton
acknowledges that Essex, in fact, submitted letters of
intent for these two individuals but, after reviewing the
documents provided by Essex and DOE in response to its
protest, Pinkerton asserts that these two individuals
rescinded their letters prior to Essex's submission of its
updated proposal.

B-246536.5
Since DOE properly rejected Pinkerton's proposal as
unacceptable, Pinkerton is not an interested party to
challenge the source selection, see, e.g., Satellite
Transmission Sys., ilnc., 70 Comp. Gent 624 (1991), 91-2 CPD
¶.60, 
In any event, based on our review of the record,
Pinkerton's allegation is without merit, The letters of
intent which Essex submitted for its key personnel initially
gave Essex "exclusive" authority to include each of the key
personnel in Essex's proposal. Subseqiently, several
individuals, including the two on whom Pinkerton's protest
focuses, wrote letters to Essex, stating that they were
rescinding the exclusive nature of their commitments.
However, each of the "rescission" letters specifically
indicates an ongoing desire and intent to work for Essex,
should Essex win the contract.
As we explained in the previous protest regarding this
procurement, provisions requiring submission of letters of
intent are included in solicitations to provide agencies
with assurances that the key personnel proposed by offerors
are, in fact, intending to work for the offeror proposing
them, Essex Corp., supra, Here, the record shows that
Essex obtained and submitted letters of intent for all the
key personnel it proposed, including the two individuals
specifically challenged by Pinkerton, The rescission
letters on which Pinkerton's protest relies do not negate
the stated intent of those individuals to be available to
perform the contract for Essex, Accordingly, Essex's
proposal complied with the solicitation requirements.
The protest is denied.
