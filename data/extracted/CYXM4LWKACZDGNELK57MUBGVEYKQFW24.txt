granted to that State by the Act of 
September 22, 1922. The grant, as to 
other lands thereafter surveyed, sub-
ject to the same provisions is effective 
upon the acceptance of the survey 
thereof as above indicated.

by the Act of January 25, 1927, and the 
mineral deposits therein are to be dis-

provision being made for judicial for-
feiture in case of disposal of any of the
