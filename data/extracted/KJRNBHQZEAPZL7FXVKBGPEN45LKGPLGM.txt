traffic infraction or Class D or Class E crime imposed for a violation of any tribal or state law must
be remitted to the Passamaquoddy Tribe or the Penobscot Nation, as appropriate, when a tribal law
enforcement agency issued the ticket, complaint, summons or warrant or made the arrest related to the

action for a violation of Title 38.’
 
SUMMARY
This amendment replaces the bill and changes the title.
It provides that all fines for Class D and Class E crimes and for civil violations in which a tribal
law enforcement agency is involved by issuing a ticket, complaint, summons or warrant or by making
an arrest must be remitted to the appropriate tribe, with one exception. The civil and criminal fines may
not be remitted to the Passamaquoddy Tribe or the Penobscot Nation if the violation is a violation of
the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 38. The court may award the Passamaquoddy Tribe and the Penobscot
Nation costs associated with their participation in the investigation and prosecution of a Title 38 violation.
