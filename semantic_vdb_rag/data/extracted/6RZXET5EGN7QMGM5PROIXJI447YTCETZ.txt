Q1. 
 Section 4.2.5.1.1 (p.19): a) Do we need to provide the positions and titles of 
all agency employees or just those associated with the proposed program? b) 
If all agency positions are required, can this be provided in an attached 
organizational chart?  
 
R1. 
Only those associated with the program. 
 
Q2. 
Section 4.2.5.1.6 (p.20): Do we need to provide documentation that each 
employee in the entire agency has had an ABI/FBI criminal background 
check, or just the key personnel for this program?  
 
R2. 
Provide documentation that key personnel for the proposed program 
has had an ABI/FBI criminal background check.  
 
Q3. 
From the Proposed Service Summary Form, what is the 504 Assurance of 
Compliance – where would we find a copy of this form/certification? 
 
R3. 
The Certification of Compliance is issued to Vendors who are licensed 
by the Department and certifies a Vendor’s compliance with Title VI of 
the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, Player, et. al., v. State of 
Alabama Department of Pensions and Security (Human Resources) et. 
al., Court Order and Judgment; and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act 
of 1973, as amended, Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.   
 
Q4. 
p. 15 Section 3.1  states “All services provided must be authorized on an 
ISP.”  Will the services be only for the mother or also for the infant?  Nowhere 
in the RFP does it mention school classes for the mother.  Will it be expected 
that some of the mothers will still be in high school and, if included in the ISP, 
the mother will attend classes?  If so, who is responsible for child care as 
classes of that nature are not listed in Section 3.3 K? 
 
R4. 
a.  Services for the mother and or the child must be authorized on the 
ISP.  b. Yes.  c. 3.3k states that you must obtain or provide up to 25 % of 
the daycare costs if not provided by internal staff this includes for 
education as well as for parenting skill development and basic living 
skills. 
 
Q5. 
p.15 Section 3.2 B states that vendors must “utilize specific admission 
criteria.”  Are vendors allowed to create our own standards/criteria for 
admission or does DHR have a set of criteria that you would like us to follow? 
 
R5. 
The criteria are set forth in the description of the children that are to be 
served in this program.

Q6. 
p.16 Section 3.2 L states that vendors must “ensure that the young mother 
and infant receives routine and emergency medical care”. Is the vendor 
fiscally responsible for routine and emergency medical care? 
 
R6. 
No. 
 
Q7. 
p. 16 Section 3.3 B states that vendors must “provide basic living skills 
training a minimum of 1 hour daily.”  Can these skills be taught by the foster 
parent?  Does the infant have to be in child care during the training or can the 
infant be present in the home and even included as part of the training (i.e. 
how to manage household tasks while giving proper supervision to an infant) 
 
R7. 
Yes to both. 
 
Q8. 
p. 17 Section 3.3 D states that the vendor needs to “ensure the child’s 
involvement in at least one extra-curricular activity.”  Who is responsible for 
the cost of child care during that time since it is not an activity listed under 
Section 3.3 K? 
 
R8. 
See R4. 
 
Q9. 
p. 17 Section 3.3 H states that the vendor must “make at least monthly 
contact with the youth’s therapist.”  Is it possible that the youth could be seen 
by one of the vendor’s staff therapists? 
 
R9. 
An ISP team decision. 
 
Q10. p. 17 and elsewhere in the RFP it refers to “All services billed as Medicaid 
Rehab services must be in compliance with Chapter 105 of the Medicaid 
Rehab Manual and are not to exceed the daily caps.  If the vendor provides 
services that are reimbursable by Medicaid, do we get to retain those funds? 
 
R10. No. 
 
Q11. p. 17 Section 3.3 J states that the vendor must “provide a minimum of 1 hour 
weekly of group or individual tutoring regarding decision-making for the youth 
and her infant.”  Is that a separate activity from the skills teaching in Section 
3.3 B?  Is there any specifications/credentials as to who would provide that 
tutoring?  Can it be a community-based service such as a local parenting 
class? 
 
R11. Yes.  No.  Yes. 
 
Q12. p. 17 Section 3.3 K states the vendor is responsible for obtaining or providing 
child care for the infant during the time that the teen mother is developing her 
parenting skills and/or preparing for independent living, including the financial

responsibility up to 25% of daycare costs.  Who is responsible for the other 
75% of daycare costs?  If the foster parent provides child care for the infant 
can he/she be reimbursed, in addition to the per diem, for that responsibility? 
 
R12. If the foster parent is providing the daycare then it is considered internal 
staff.  If an outside Vendor has to be paid the 75% would be the 
responsibility of DHR. 
 
Q13. p.20 Section 4.2.5.2. If the vendor experienced no audit findings from its 
auditors the past 3 audits is it satisfactory to DHR to submit the audit letter 
that basically just states that the audit was conducted according to generally 
accepted auditing standards and that the financial statements present the 
financial position of the vendor fairly in all material respects? 
 
R13. Yes.  
 
Q14. p. 21 Section 4.2.5.3.5 states that, as part of the discharge policy, the vendor 
is “to include provisions of “step down” to a less restrictive environment.”  If 
the mother is placed in foster care, is there the expectation that the mother 
will be moved to Independent Living or similar arrangement and would that be 
the responsibility of the vendor? 
 
 
R14. An ISP team makes the decision where the child will move and when 
it is not the responsibility of the Vendor. 
 
Q15. Basic Residential Services #2009-100-12: 4.2.5.3.4, TLP #2009-100-11: 
4.2.5.3.4; Mothers and Infants #2009-100-10: 4.2.5.3.4: & Moderate #2009-
100-08: 4.2.5.3.4 – All say “vendors must identify the specific county/counties 
to be served” – Does this mean we are unable to state on the RFP 
proposal “statewide”?  If we must specify the counties does it mean we 
are unable to accept placement of the child not located in those 
counties? 
 
R15. Vendors may specify “statewide” slots and no need to specify all 67 
counties.   
 
Q16. Basic Residential Services #2009-100-12: 4.2.5.4.3, TLP #2009-100-11: 
4.2.5.4.3; Mothers and Infants #2009-100-10: 4.2.5.4.3: & Moderate #2009-
100-08: 4.2.5.4.3 – “Vendor must comply with all he terms and conditions 
of…..Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, the Americans with Disabilities 
Act, etc.” – What if we are “in process” with compliance with the 
Rehabilitation Act  of 1973?  Is this acceptable?

R16. Then a plan approved by the Vendor’s board should be attached with a 
time line that shows when compliance will be achieved.  That plan will 
have to be approved by our EEO office before a contract can be issued. 
 
Q17. Basic Residential Services #2009-100-12: 4.2.5.3.6, TLP #2009-100-11: 
4.2.5.3.6; Mothers and Infants #2009-100-10: 4.2.5.3.6: & Moderate #2009-
100-08: 4.2.5.3.6 – states that al natural disaster evacuation/pandemic plans 
must be approved by State DHR.  What happens if State DHR does not 
approve of what we put in this section of the proposal? 
 
R17.   Since this is a new requirement we will work with the Vendor.
