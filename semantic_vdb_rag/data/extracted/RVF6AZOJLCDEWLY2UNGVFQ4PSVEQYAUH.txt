Rural Housing Preservation Grants
  
  
On May 9, 2012 the U.S. Department of Agriculture Rural Development announced the
availability of funding for the Rural Housing Preservation Grants (Catalog for Federal Domestic
Assistance number 10.433).
 
The purpose of this program is to install or improve plumbing, provide access to individuals with
disabilities, weatherize and repair homes in rural communities. The grants are then distributed
to qualified homeowners or owners of multi-family rental properties or cooperative dwellings
who rent to low- and very-low-income residents. USDA does not provide funding directly to
homeowners under this program. 
The application deadline is June 25, 2012
.  
Eligible applicants include town or county governments, public agencies, federally recognized
Indian Tribes, and non-profit and faith-based organizations
