Executive Summary 
The Building Energy Codes Program (BECP) recently conducted a nationwide commercial energy code 
analysis for the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). The analysis compares ANSI/ASHRAE/IESNA1 Standard 
90.1-2007 with the commercial code in each state as of June 2009. The results are provided in this report in 
chapters specific to each state. 
Standard 90.1-2007 was chosen for this analysis because it is the baseline energy standard established in the 
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and the subject of DOE’s forthcoming determination of 
energy savings for Standard 90.1. An overview of Standard 90.1-2007, as well as a brief comparison to previous 
versions, is provided as introductory information. 
States with unique energy codes were not included in the analysis as the codes in these states would be difficult 
to appropriately compare to Standard 90.1 and most of these states have energy offices that routinely assess 
their codes against the national codes. In states with codes prior to and including the 2000 IECC or Standard 
90.1-1999, those states with no statewide energy code, and home rule states which did not specifically request 
that another code be used, Standard 90.1-1999 was used as the baseline for comparison.  Standard 90.1-1999 
was chosen as the default baseline because BECP believes it fairly represents current construction practice in 
states with older codes or no codes.   
Three DOE Benchmark buildings were used for the simulation used in this analysis: a medium office building 
(53,600 ft2), a mid-rise apartment building (33,700 ft2), and a non-refrigerated warehouse (49,500 ft2)—
representing the Standard 90.1 nonresidential, residential, and semiheated requirements, respectively. The 
buildings are described in further detail in the report, and in Appendix A. 
Locations for the analysis were selected based on obtaining a sample representative of each climate zone in the 
state, where TMY2 weather file locations existed, making sure to include the state capital. In the absence of a 
TMY2 weather file for a particular climate zone in a state, a representative location in an adjacent state was 
used for the purposes of the simulation. These locations, and the full results of each state specific analysis 
completed by BECP, are provided in the following report.2

1.0 Introduction 
This report describes the results of a nationwide commercial energy code analysis undertaken by the Building 
Energy Codes Program (BECP) for the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE).  The task involved comparing each 
state’s current commercial energy code3 to ANSI/ASHRAE/IESNA4 Standard 90.1-2007 (Standard 90.1-2007).  
State-specific results are provided in separate chapters. 
The commercial comparison is made to Standard 90.1-2007 because that is the baseline commercial energy 
standard established in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.  Standard 90.1-2007 will also 
soon be the subject of DOE’s latest determination of energy savings for Standard 90.1. 
2.0 Overview of Standard 90.1-2007 
Standard 90.1-2007 sets requirements for the cost-effective use of energy in commercial buildings.  Certain 
buildings that have very low energy use, such as buildings with no heating or cooling, are exempt.  Standard 
90.1-2007 applies to new buildings and to alterations and additions to existing buildings.   
Table 1 shows the organization of Standard 90.1-2007.  Most of the actual requirements are contained in 
Sections 5-10.

3.0 Comparison to Previous Versions of Standard 90.1 
The first Standard 90.1 was published in 1975, with revisions released in 1980, 1989, and 1999.  Standard 90.1 
was placed under continuous maintenance in 1999 which allowed the Standard to be updated with publication 
of approved addenda.  Beginning with Standard 90.1-2001, the Standard moved to a three-year publication 
cycle. 
Substantial revisions to the Standard have occurred since 1989.  One major change was a complete revision of 
the climate zones in 2004.  These revised climates zones are shown in Figure 1.

Some of the significant requirements in Standard 90.1-2007 include: 
 Stringent building insulation requirements 
 Simplified fenestration requirements excluding orientation and window wall ratio 
 Demand control ventilation requirements for spaces with an occupant density greater than 40 people per 
1000 ft2 
 Separate simple and complex mechanical requirements. 
4.0 Energy Analysis Assumptions 
An energy analysis was conducted comparing each state’s base code to Standard 90.1-2007.  The EnergyPlus 
software was used to determine the energy impacts.  EnergyPlus was developed by the U.S. Department of 
Energy5 (DOE).  
4.1 State Base Codes 
States with unique energy codes (i.e., those that do not adopt/amend the International Energy Conservation 
Code® [IECC] or Standard 90.1) were not included in the analysis.  This decision was made by DOE for two 
reasons:  1) these states generally have codes that have little resemblance to Standard 90.1, making a thorough 
comparison beyond the scope of this effort, and 2) most of these states have highly capable energy offices that 
routinely assess their codes against the national codes.  However, states that were not included in the original 
analysis may request to be considered for a similar analysis by contacting BECP at techsupport@becp.pnl.gov.  
In some cases, decisions about base codes needed to be made.  For example, all versions of the IECC include 
two compliance options for commercial buildings:  the commercial requirements in the IECC and Standard 
90.1.  Since there can only be one base code in the analysis, if a state specifically adopts the IECC as its 
commercial code, the commercial requirements from the applicable IECC were used in the analysis.  There are 
several states with older commercial codes6.  For states with codes prior to and including the 2000 IECC or 
Standard 90.1-1999, Standard 90.1-1999 was used as the base code. 
Standard 90.1-1999 was chosen as the baseline construction for states with older codes because it has been 
around long enough (about 10 years) to allow many of the concepts and requirements embodied in it to become 
common practice in the construction industry.  Standard 90.1-1999 also represents a major change in ASHRAE 
standards, coming ten years after the previous version of Standard 90.1.  Standard 90.1-1999 is old enough that 
states considering adoption of Standard 90.1-2007 will still see significant savings, but not so old that states will 
be misled by the savings shown in this report.  Keeping with the concept of Standard 90.1-1999 as “common 
practice” in the construction industry, Standard 90.1-1999 was also used as the base code for states with no 
state-wide commercial energy code.  Some home rule states7 requested a specific code be used in the analysis; 
for all other home rule states Standard 90.1-1999 was used as the base code.   
                                                 
5 EnergyPlus is available and discussed in more detail at http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/  
6 Examples include codes based on 90A90B, 90.1-1989, and the 1992 Model Energy Code. 
7 In home rule states, codes are adopted and enforced on a local level.

4.2 Benchmark Buildings 
Three DOE Benchmark buildings8 were used for the simulation:  a medium office building, a mid-rise 
apartment building, and a non-refrigerated warehouse (semiheated).  These three building types represent the 
Standard 90.1 nonresidential, residential, and semiheated requirements, respectively.  For states that have 
adopted a newer version of Standard 90.1 (1999 or later), the three types of envelope requirements were 
compared directly.  For states that have adopted a version of the IECC that contains only a single set of 
commercial envelope requirements (any version prior to the 2009 IECC), the medium office and mid-rise 
apartment buildings were modeled using the single set of IECC requirements.  The warehouse building was 
modeled using the semiheated envelope requirements from the reference standard version of Standard 90.1 
incorporated in the version of the IECC under consideration.  DOE assumes that any designer of a warehouse 
that would truly be considered semiheated within Standard 90.1 would be motivated to use the Standard 90.1 
semiheated envelope requirements as allowed by the IECC.   
Use of the IECC requirements for semiheated values in a comparison with Standard 90.1-2007 would lead to 
the awkward conclusion that the IECC is more stringent.  This is true in the sense that use of more insulation in 
semiheated buildings will save some energy.  However, because Standard 90.1-2007 is the designated 
comparison and it has separate semiheated envelope requirements, DOE chose to compare those semiheated 
requirements in the ASHRAE reference standard to the IECC. 
The medium office has a gross area of 53,600 ft2, three floors, and a window-to-wall ratio (WWR) of 33%.  The 
HVAC systems are assumed to be a gas furnace and a packaged DX unit.  The walls are modeled as steel frame 
walls, and the roof as insulation entirely above deck. 
The mid-rise apartment building has a gross area of 33,700 ft2, four floors, and a WWR of 15%.  The assumed 
heating system is a gas furnace, with one split DX system assumed to provide cooling for each apartment.  The 
walls are modeled as steel frame walls, and the roof as insulation entirely above deck. 
The semiheated warehouse has a gross area of 49,500 ft2, one floor, and no windows in the storage area.  
Limited heating is provided by unit heaters and no cooling is provided.  The walls and roof are modeled as 
metal building walls and roof. 
The DOE Benchmark buildings are also further described in Appendix A. 
Equipment efficiencies are assumed to be the current Federal requirements for all codes.  While older codes 
may have older (lower) equipment efficiencies listed in them, equipment that meets the requirements of these 
old codes may no longer be manufactured or imported into the United States.  Thus, this equipment is typically 
not available.  There are some pieces of HVAC equipment that are not covered by the Federal requirements 
(notably, chillers), but the HVAC equipment modeled in the three benchmark buildings used in the analysis is 
covered by the Federal requirements. 
The HVAC system for the medium office building is simulated with an economizer when required by the code.  
By default, the economizer requirements are based on Table 6.5.1 in Standard 90.1-2004.  A design day 
simulation was done in all climate zones to determine the cooling capacity and the economizer requirement.  
The typical cooling capacity in the medium office building exceeds 135,000 Btu/h in all climate zones.  Table 3 
shows the economizer requirement for representative locations in the various climate zones.  The building

simulation assumes that the economizer high limit shutoff will be controlled by differential dry bulb 
temperature, a control option allowed by the Standard.  Under this control scenario, when the outdoor air 
temperature is below both the return air temperature and the high ambient shutoff temperature, the economizer 
is enabled.

4.3 The 2003 IECC and Lighting Power Density 
Over the two decades of commercial energy code development, changes in allowable lighting power density 
have been one of the most important drivers of energy efficiency.  As an example, Table 4 shows the allowable 
interior lighting power densities for the three buildings used in this analysis.  Similar differences in 
requirements for other building types can also be listed.

The issue with the 2003 IECC is that it uses Standard 90.1-2001 as its reference standard.  The 2003 IECC 
contains the low lighting power densities exemplified by the 1.0 watt per square foot value in the actual text of 
Chapter 8.  But the 2003 IECC also allows the use of Standard 90.1-2001 under the provisions of Chapter 7.  
And Standard 90.1-2001 has the mid-range interior lighting power densities exemplified by the 1.3 watts per 
square foot value.  No other version of the IECC has as significant a discontinuity between the requirements of 
the IECC and the requirements of the ASHRAE reference standard.   
For this analysis, the requirements of the 2003 IECC were used.  While lighting designers may very well have 
discovered this discontinuity, the use of the 2003 requirements provide a conservative estimate of the savings 
associated with adoption of Standard 90.1-2007.  Use of Standard 90.1-2001 lighting densities as the baseline 
would simply increase the savings. 
The simulation models for nonresidential and semiheated buildings use the lighting power density requirements 
for office and warehouse, depending on the activity type of the thermal zone.  In the case of the residential 
building model, the lighting power density is not regulated in older codes and is assumed to be 0.36 W/sf in 
apartment units based on the Building America benchmark model.  The office area and corridor lighting 
requirements in the residential building model are based on Standard 90.1-2004 requirements. 
4.4 Selected Locations 
The approach used to select representative locations for the analysis first focused on the goal of having one 
location to represent each climate zone within a state, with one of the locations being the state capital.  TMY2 
weather file locations were used.  When a climate zone in a state was not represented by a TMY2 weather file 
location in that state, a representative location in an adjacent state was selected to represent the climate zone for 
purposes of the simulation.  However, a representative city within the actual state is referenced in the report 
tables.  A listing of the selected locations is shown below.

BUILDING ENERGY CODES PROGRAM
The U.S. Department of Energy’s Building Energy Codes 
Program is an information resource on national model 
energy codes. We work with other government agencies, state and 
local jurisdictions, national code organizations, and industry to promote 
stronger building energy codes and help states adopt, implement, 
and enforce those codes.

Oklahoma 
Summary 
Oklahoma has no statewide commercial code, therefore for this state comparison, DOE has selected Standard 
90.1-1999 as the baseline standard for the analysis.  Standard 90.1-2007 would substantially improve energy 
efficiency in commercial buildings in Oklahoma.  The analysis of the impact of Standard 90.1-2007 resulted in 
energy and cost savings.  
Main Differences Between the Current State Code and Standard 90.1-2007 
Standard 90.1-1999 precedes Standard 90.1-2004 and is therefore older (and less stringent) than DOE’s 
currently mandated commercial building energy standard, Standard 90.1-2004.  This selection was made in the 
belief that Standard 90.1-1999 is an appropriate representation of commercial current practice, as it was 
developed more than ten years ago.  DOE’s analysis of Standard 90.1-1999 is included in DOE’s determination 
of energy savings for Standard 90.1-2004, which compared Standard 90.1-2004 to Standard 90.1-2001 and 
Standard 90.1-1999.  The complete results of this analysis may be found at 
http://www.energycodes.gov/implement/determinations_90.1-2004.stm.  In comparing Standard 90.1-1999 to 
Standard 90.1-2007, Standard 90.1-2007: 
 Has fewer climate “zones” or “bins” (26 bins versus 8 climate zones). 
 Has more stringent building envelope requirements (due in large part to having fewer climate zones). 
 Has more strict requirements for vestibules in cold climates. 
 Differentiates windows by fixed versus operable rather than by frame material and usage. 
 Includes a requirement for demand controlled ventilation in high occupancy spaces.  
 Removes a deadband exception for data processing centers that eliminates the possibility of 
simultaneous heating and cooling. 
 Increases stringency in fan power limitations. 
 Increases boiler efficiency requirements. 
 Applies part-load fan power requirements to more smaller systems. 
 Revises the additional lighting power allowance for retail displays to lower the allowance for some 
categories of merchandise. 
 Has more detailed outdoor lighting power requirements. 
A comparison of the thermal envelope requirements is provided in Table 1.

Energy Analysis 
An energy analysis was conducted comparing each state’s base code to Standard 90.1-2007.  The EnergyPlus 
software was used to determine the energy impacts.  Summary savings results are shown below by building 
type.  Results are shown for the electricity and natural gas energy use intensity (in kWh/sf-year and kBtu/sf-
year, respectively) for both the base code and Standard 90.1-2007.  Results are also shown for the percent 
reduction of overall site energy usage and energy cost from the base case to Standard 90.1-2007.  The energy 
cost savings are estimated using national average energy costs of $0.0939 per kWh for electricity and $1.2201 
per therm for natural gas.  Presentation of the individual results for electricity and natural gas usage allows 
interested parties to calculate source energy or energy cost savings based on state (rather than national average) 
fuel prices.  Total annual energy usage for the three building prototypes may be calculated by multiplying the 
energy use intensity numbers by the square footage of the prototype building.

BUILDING ENERGY CODES PROGRAM
The U.S. Department of Energy’s Building Energy Codes 
Program is an information resource on national model 
energy codes. We work with other government agencies, state and 
local jurisdictions, national code organizations, and industry to promote 
stronger building energy codes and help states adopt, implement, 
and enforce those codes.
