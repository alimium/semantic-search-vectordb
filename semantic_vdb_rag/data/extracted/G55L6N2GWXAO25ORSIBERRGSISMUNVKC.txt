GUIDE TO THE READER 
The Data Book provides detailed information on the Workforce Investment Act (WIA) 
programs, including information about who is served, what services are provided, and the 
outcomes attained by participants.  The Data Book is based on the Workforce Investment 
Standard Record Data (WIASRD), which is an individual-level data set containing information 
reported annually by states to the Employment and Training Administration.1  This version of the 
Data Book uses data provided by states in their Program Year (PY) 2009, Quarter 4 submissions, 
which contain information about individuals who participated in WIA at any time from January 
1, 2008 to June 30, 2010.  It thus includes individuals who finished participation (“exited”) from 
January 1, 2008 to March 31, 2010 and individuals who had  started participation before July 1, 
2010, but had not finished  participation by June 30, 2010.   All tables in the Data Bookhave 
been computed using the final version of the PY 2009, Quarter 4 WIASRD data, which includes 
a variety of data corrections and adjustments.  Some tables also use data from previous 
submissions. 
The State version of the Data Book contains tables based on a single state’s data, as identified in 
the header for each table.  Some tables compare the state with the nation or with other states.  
Especially for small states, some data are based on only a small number of exiters, as shown in 
either the first row or first column of each table.  The reader should use caution when 
interpreting results based on only a few exiters.  For example, percentages based on 400 exiters 
have a 95% confidence interval of 5 percentage points.  Percentages based on 100 exiters have 
a 95% confidence interval of 10 percentage points. 
General notes that apply to most or all of the tables in the Data Book appear in this section.  
More detailed Notes to Tables are provided in Appendix A, which follows the last table.  These 
Notes to Tables present important information that is critical to the proper interpretation of the 
data in the tables.  Appendix B provides definitions of the data items presented. 
Overview of Tables 
The Data Book contains four primary groups of tables: 
 Section I contains tables for WIA Title 1B as a whole, including the programs for 
adults, dislocated workers, and youth.  It also includes National Emergency Grant 
                                                 
1 Detailed information about this data set, including the specifications that states were to follow when reporting, can 
be found in Training and Employment Guidance Letter 14-00, Change 1.  Employment and Training 
Administration, November 19, 2002.  http://www.doleta.gov/usworkforce/documents/tegl/#14-00ch1.

(NEG) projects.  This section also includes tables showing trends over time in the 
number of exiters by state. 
 Section II contains tables for the adult program, which serves individuals aged 18 and 
higher.  All adults are eligible for services under the adult program.  However, states 
are to give priority to low-income adults in the event that funds are limited. 
 Section III contains tables for the dislocated worker program and for NEGs.  
Dislocated workers are generally experienced workers who have been laid off (or 
received notice of termination) due to a permanent closure or substantial layoff.   
 Section IV contains tables for the youth program, which serves individuals aged 14 to 
21.  With some exceptions, eligibility for youth program services is limited to low-
income youth.   
Sections II, III and IV all follow a similar structure.  First, there are tables that show the 
characteristics of WIA exiters.  These are followed by tables that show the services received by 
exiters.  The final group of tables shows the outcomes received by exiters.   
For adults and dislocated workers, two primary groups of characteristics are shown: 
characteristics available for all exiters and characteristics available only for exiters who received 
intensive or training services.  When interpreting the information in the tables it is important to 
remember that these latter characteristics were not collected for individuals who received only 
core services to limit the data collection burden on individuals who received only limited WIA 
services.  Thus, percentages for these characteristics are based only on individuals who received 
intensive or training services.   
The adult and dislocated worker tables do not include individuals who received only self- and 
informational services. 
For dislocated workers, the tables combine information on individuals served by the formula-
funded Title IB dislocated worker program and by National Emergency Grants to provide a 
picture of all services provided to dislocated workers by WIA Title 1. 
Tables show characteristics, services received, or outcomes for WIA participants for the most 
recent year for which data on the particular characteristic, service, or outcome is available.  The 
only exception to this is for the outcomes trends over time tables, for which the more recent time 
periods do not contain data for an entire year’s worth of exiters for some outcomes.  The 
exceptions are described in the notes at the bottom of these tables, as well as in Appendix A. 
None of the tables includes information on some other WIA Title 1 programs, including the 
Indian and Native American Program, the National Farmworker Jobs Program, veterans' 
workforce investment programs, and Job Corps.  These other programs are not reported in the 
WIASRD data used for this Data Book, but in their own separate reporting systems.

Guide to the Reader
Summary of Table Notation 
In interpreting the data in the tables, the reader should note that: 
 Data that is not available is shown as blank.  For example, in Table II-10 the 
percentages for the characteristics of exiters who received intensive or training 
services are not shown in the column titled “Core Services Only.” 
 “0.0” is used to denote percentages that are less than 0.05%. 
Units of Measurement 
The numbers appearing in the table are either raw counts (e.g., the number of exiters), 
percentages (e.g., the percentage who are female), or averages (e.g., average quarterly earnings 
in the quarter after exit). 
 Raw counts represent the number of exiters identified by the combination of the row 
and column headings.  Individuals with missing data on a row or column heading are 
not included in the count.   
 Percentages generally represent the percentage identified by the row heading among 
all of those identified by the column heading—that is they are column percentages.  
Some tables, however, present row percentages, the percentage identified by the 
column heading among those identified by the row heading.  These are specified in 
Notes to Tables—one example is Table II-24 that shows the percentage receiving 
different levels of service by state.  Tables that show column percentages always show 
the number of exiters in the first row so that the reader can see the size of the universe 
on which the percentage is based.  Tables that show row percentages always show the 
number of exiters in the first column.   
 Individuals with missing data on either the row or column heading are excluded 
when calculating percentages.  In addition, all outcome data exclude individuals who 
were institutionalized (e.g., in a hospital or prison) or deceased at exit or had a 
medical or health condition that precluded them from continuing WIA services or 
entering employment.  However, these individuals are included in the number of 
exiters shown in the outcome tables. 
 Averages are calculated for selected items that are measured on a continuous scale 
(e.g., quarterly earnings in the quarter after exit) and are computed after excluding 
missing data. 
 
Quality of the Underlying Data 
The WIASRD reporting system was first effective for PY 2000.  Thus, the PY 2009 data used for 
this Data Book represents data from the tenth year of reporting.  As with any new data system, 
states varied in how long it took to implement fully the different elements of the reporting 
system.  Thus, the quality and completeness of the data varies among states, especially in early 
years.  For example, the WIA performance measures can be calculated from the WIASRD data 
and compared to data separately reported by states to ETA.  This comparison showed that 
Social Policy Research Associates

Guide to the Reader 
calculations of the entered employment rate and retention rate from the WIASRD generally were 
close to the data reported by most states.  Thus, there is substantial consistency in the data on 
postprogram employment.  However, there were larger discrepancies for earnings change, 
younger youth retention, and younger youth diploma attainment.  These discrepancies have been 
reduced over time.  When there are discrepancies, the states generally reported higher outcomes 
than we calculated from the WIASRD.  It is not known whether the WIASRD data or the state’s 
calculations are correct when there are discrepancies.   
Some new and revised reporting requirements were introduced with the PY 2005 WIASRD.  
Thus, this data book includes some data reported for the fifth time.  These data may be 
incomplete.  New characteristics data items included offender for adults, other eligible person as 
a category of veteran status, and ever in foster care for youth.  In addition, Food Stamps was 
added to other public assistance.  New services data include core self-service and informational 
activities, workforce information services and prevocational services for adults and dislocated 
workers, disaster relief for dislocated workers, and enrolled in education for youth.  In addition, 
new categories for the type of training were reported for adults and dislocated workers.  These 
new fields may be underreported, more so in the earlier time periods covered by the data.  Please 
see the notes to tables for more details on some of the changes. 
The data set used to prepare the Data Book underwent an extensive data review.  As a result of 
this data review, some data for a few states was recoded or set to missing when the data were 
clearly incorrect.  Data that was set to missing are excluded from the calculations of percentages 
and averages in this Data Book, as discussed above.  Consequently, state results reported in the 
Data Book may differ from states’ own computations from their data. 
Changes From the PY 2008 Data Book 
The PY 2009 State Data Book incorporates a significant change from the PY 2008 version.  In 
serveral adult and dislocated worker tables showing performance outcomes, the column for the 
employment and credential rate has been replaced by a column for the credential attainment rate.  
The latter shows the percentage of adult or dislocated worker trainees who attain a credential, but  
is not one of the official WIA performance measures.   
Confidentiality 
To preserve the confidentiality of WIA participants, data have been suppressed when a column 
or row is based on fewer than 9 exiters.  The entire row or column will be blank.  However, on 
the second page of two page tables “0” will show for the number of exiters.  The actual number 
of exiters may be anywhere from zero to eight.

Part I: Summary Comparisons Across Programs 
Table I-1 
This table shows trends in the number of exiters by program of participation.   
 
Subcategories do not sum to totals because individuals may be included in more than one 
subcategory.  For example, a person may be coenrolled in both a local program and a statewide 
program. 
Table I-2 
This table shows the number of exiters by state and program of participation.  Both statewide and 
local programs are included.  NEG programs are included in the dislocated worker and total 
columns. 
Table I-3 
This table shows the number of exiters with selected characteristics by program of participation.  
Both statewide and local programs are included.  NEG programs are included in the dislocated 
worker and total columns. 
Table I-4  
to  
Table I-7 
These tables show trends over time in the number of exiters by state.  Table I-4 shows trends in 
the number of exiters for adults.  Table I-5 shows dislocated workers who participated in state 
and local (formula-funded) programs.  Table I-6 shows dislocated workers who participated in 
National Emergency Grant (NEG) projects.  Table I-7 shows youth.  
There was a large increase in adult exiters from PY 2005 to PY 2006: from 252,065 to 624,648 
with continued increases in later years.  Most of this increase occurred in New York, which 
increased from 31,990 to 304,083.  Most of this increase likely occurred because of changes in 
practices regarding coenrollment between WIA and Wagner-Peyser.  There are also significant 
increases in Louisiana and Oklahoma.  Mississippi also increased but then declined in 
subsequent years. 
There was also a substantial increase in dislocated worker exiters in formula-funded programs: 
from 155,526 to 230,838 between PY 2005 and PY 2006.  Again most of this increase was in 
New York: from 17,260 to 82,666.  This New York increase also likely resulted from changes in 
coenrollment practices.  There was also a large increase in Mississippi, followed by a decline in 
PY 2007. 
There was a large increase in exiters from NEG projects from PY 2004 to PY 2005 and a 
decrease in subsequent years.  Most of these changes over time are due to a single NEG project 
in Texas (TX11), which increased from zero in PY 2004 to 65,209 in PY 2005 and then dropped 
to 20,936 in PY 2006 and 2,066 in PY 2007. 
Part II: Adult Exiters 
 
Tables in Part II include all exiters from adult programs, including both local and statewide 
programs.   
Table II-1  
to 
Table II-13 
These tables show the characteristics of adult exiters.  Most numbers shown are the percentages 
within the column heading.  Exceptions include the number of exiters shown in the first three 
rows, which are counts, and preprogram earnings and average highest grade completed, for 
which both averages and percentages within categories are shown. 
In calculating percentages, individuals with missing data on either the row or column heading are 
excluded.  Values of zero are excluded when calculating average preprogram earnings 
Some characteristics, those shown under “Characteristics of Exiters who Received Intensive or 
Training Services,” are available only for individuals who received intensive or training services.  
Percentages for these characteristics are calculated within this smaller universe, again excluding 
missing data.   
Table II-1 to  
Table II-2 
These tables show trends over time in the characteristics of exiters for both the state and the 
nation.   
Table II-2 shows counts of exiters with particular characteristics.  These counts exclude missing 
data and cannot be used to compute the percentages in Table II-1.  Also, the counts for the 
Social Policy Research Associates

Appendix A:  Notes to Tables 
 
 
characteristics under the heading “Characteristics of Exiters who Received Training or Intensive 
Services” do not include individuals who received only core services and, thus, are an 
underestimate of the total number of persons with the characteristic who were served by WIA. 
See the notes to Tables I-4 to I-7 for discussion of some of the significant changes in the number 
of exiters. 
Table II-7  
to 
Table II-10 
These tables are based only on individuals who received intensive or training services because 
this is the universe for which the column headings are available.  Some of these tables include a 
column labeled “With Intensive or Training Services,” which represents all individuals for whom 
data on the column headings is collected and is the appropriate comparison for the other columns 
(rather than the data in other tables for all exiters).   
Table II-11 
This table shows the characteristics of individuals by major service categories.  The column 
headings “Core Services Only,” “Core and Intensive Services Only,” and “Training” are 
mutually exclusive and exhaustive.  An individual is included in one and only one of these 
columns.   
Table II-12 
This table shows the number of individuals with specified characteristics by major service 
categories.  Missing data are excluded from these counts.  Therefore, they cannot be used to 
calculate the percentages shown in Table II-11, which exclude missing data from the 
denominator of percentages. 
The number of exiters shown for characteristics that are available only for individuals who 
received intensive or training services is a substantial undercount of the total number with these 
characteristics because individuals who receive only core services are not counted. 
The column headings “Core Services Only,” “Core and Intensive Services Only,” and “Training” 
are mutually exclusive and exhaustive.  An individual is included in one and only one of these 
columns.   
Table II-14  
to 
Table II-23 
These tables show the services received by exiters.  Most numbers shown are the percentages 
within the column heading.  Exceptions include the number of exiters shown in the first row, 
which is a count, and weeks participated, for which both the average and percentages within 
categories are shown. 
In calculating percentages, individuals with missing data on either the row or column heading are 
excluded.   
The row headings “Core services, including staff-assisted, only,” “Intensive & core services 
only,” and “Training services” are mutually exclusive and exhaustive.  An individual is included 
in one and only one of these rows.   
The percentages shown for the six types of training—on-the-job, skill upgrading & retraining, 
entrepreneurial training, ABE or ESL in combination with training, customized training, and 
other occupational skills training—are calculated among those who received training.  There is 
no clear distinction between skill upgrading & retraining and other occupational skills training.   
These table show trends over time in the services received by exiters for both the state and the 
nation. 
Table II-14 
to 
Table II-15 
See the notes to Tables I-4 to I-7 for discussion of some of the significant changes in the number 
of exiters.  The large increase in exiters in New York between PY 2005 and PY 2006 likely 
explains many of the changes in services between those two periods.  In particular.  The increase 
in the percentage receiving only core services (from 24.4% to 67.2%) likely occurs because over 
80% of exiters in New York in PY 2006 and later years received only core services.

Appendix A:  Notes to Tables 
Table II-20 
to 
Table II-23 
These tables are based only on individuals who received intensive or training services because 
this is the universe for which the column headings are available.  Some of these tables include a 
column labeled “With Intensive or Training Services,” which represents all individuals for whom 
data on the column headings is collected and is the appropriate comparison for the other columns 
(rather than the data in other tables for all exiters).   
Because these tables show services for a universe that is limited to individuals who receive 
intensive or training services, they should be interpreted with caution.  For example, Table II-22 
indicates the percentage of low-income individuals receive training.  However, because low-
income individuals who receive only core services are excluded, the true percentage receiving 
training may be considerably less.   
Table II-24 
This table shows services provided by state.  The column for number of exiters shows the count 
of exiters in the state.  The remaining columns show the percentage within the state that received 
the service identified by the column heading.  These values can be compared with the national 
values in the first row.  Thus, unlike most other tables, this table presents row percentages, not 
column percentages. 
The distribution among the service categories within a state may be strongly affected by policies 
and practices regarding payment for services by WIA and Wagner-Peyser and coenrollment 
between the two programs.  For example, Delaware shows that 98.8% of exiters received 
training, possibly because Wagner-Peyser funds were used for core and intensive services.  
Conversely, in New York 83.4% of exiters received only core services, possibly because of 
extensive coenrollment with Wagner-Peyser. 
These tables calculate each outcome for the most recent year’s worth of exiters for whom the 
outcome data is available, with the exception of Tables II-25 and II-26, which show time trends. 
Table II-25  
to 
Table II-36 
Individuals who were reported as institutionalized or deceased at exit, those who had medical 
conditions that precluded continued participation in WIA or entry into employment or continued 
participation in the program, those providing care to a family member with a health/medical 
condition that precludes entry into employment or continued participation in the program, 
returning Reservists who choose not to continue WIA services, and individuals who did not 
provide a valid Social Security number are excluded from the calculations.  However, they are 
included in the number of exiters shown. 
All outcomes are calculated within the group defined by the column heading: 
 The first group of outcomes shown contains the Common Measures, including entered 
employment rate, retention in the 2nd and 3rd quarters after exit, and average earnings in the 
2nd and 3rd quarters after exit. 
 The second group of outcomes contains the other WIA performance measures and 
comparable 12-month outcomes.  These have been calculated following the official 
definitions.  See Appendix B for summary definitions.  
 The third group of outcomes includes information about the job held in the quarter after 
exit.  This information is reported for all individuals employed in the quarter after exit, 
whether or not they were employed at participation. 
 Other outcome information includes detail on some of the data used in the computation of 
the common and WIA performance measures. 
Most numbers shown are the percentages within the column heading.  Exceptions include the 
number of exiters, earnings change, and average earnings. 
The distributions of earnings in the quarter after exit and earnings in the 3rd quarter after exit 
include only individuals with earnings in the quarter.  Thus, the percentages shown sum to 100%. 
In calculating percentages and averages, individuals with missing data on either the row or 
column heading are excluded.

Appendix A:  Notes to Tables 
 
 
Table II-25 
to II-26  
These tables show trends over time in the outcomes of WIA exiters for both the state and the 
nation.   
Data for exiters from April 2008 to March 2009 are complete except for the data on outcomes in 
the 4th quarter after exit.  Data on outcomes in the 4th quarter after exit are for exiters from April 
2008 to December 2008.   
Data for exiters from October 2008 to September 2009 do not include data on outcomes for the 
4th quarter after exit.  Data on outcomes in the 2nd quarter after exit are for exiters from October 
2008 to June 2009 .  Data on outcomes in the 3rd quarter after exit are for exiters from October 
2008 to March 2009 . 
Data for earlier periods are complete. 
See the notes to Tables II-25 to II-36 for additional information. 
See the notes to Tables I-4 to I-7 for a discussion of trends over time in the number of exiters.  
These trends can have impacts on the trends in outcomes.  In particular, the large increase in the 
number of exiters from New York in PY 2006 may have affected the entered employment rate 
and the employment and credential rate because these outcomes were lower than average in New 
York (and lower than previous years in New York). 
Table II-25 shows the calculated outcomes, while Table II-26 shows the number of exiters 
attaining positive outcomes.  The calculated outcomes in Table II-25 generally cannot be 
computed from the data in Table II-26 due to exclusions from outcome measurement. 
Table II-37 
This table shows the WIA performance measures calculated within detailed groups based on the 
characteristics of exiters from two different cohorts of exiters.  The entered employment rate and 
credential rate performance measures are given for exiters from October 2008 to September 
2009, whereas the employment retention and earnings change performance measures are given 
for exiters from April 2008 to March 2009.  Using two cohorts ensures that each performance 
measure is calculated for the most recent year’s worth of exiters available.  
The column titled “Number of Exiters” contains the number of exiters in the group defined by 
the row heading.  The remaining columns show the four performance measures calculated within 
the group of exiters defined by the row heading.  All of the performance measures, except 
earnings change, are percentages. 
Outcomes for characteristics listed under “Characteristics of Exiters who Received Intensive or 
Training Services” include only individuals who received intensive or training services because 
information on the row heading is not collected for individuals who receive only core services. 
See Appendix B for summary definitions of the performance measures. 
Table II-38 
This table shows the WIA performance measures calculated within detailed groups based on the 
services received by exiters from two different cohorts of exiters.  The entered employment rate

Table II-39 
This table shows the WIA performance measures calculated within each state for exiters from 
two different cohorts of exiters.  The entered employment rate and credential rate performance 
measures are given for exiters from October 2008 to September 2009, whereas the employment 
retention and earnings change performance measures are given for exiters from April 2008 to 
March 2009.  Using two cohorts ensures that each performance measure is calculated for the 
most recent year’s worth of exiters available.  
The columns titled “Number of Exiters” contain the number of exiters in the state identified by 
the row heading.  The remaining columns show the four performance measures calculated within 
the state.  All of the performance measures, except earnings change, are percentages.  These 
performance measures are calculated using WIASRD data and may differ, sometimes 
substantially, from the performance reported by the state in its PY 2009 Annual Report. 
See Appendix B for the summary definitions of the performance measures. 
Part III: Dislocated Worker Exiters 
 
Tables in Part III contain information on all dislocated worker exiters, including exiters from 
local and statewide programs and National Emergency Grant (NEG) projects, except that Table 
III-41 excludes exiters served only by NEG projects.   
Individuals served only by rapid response are excluded from WIASRD reporting and are not 
included in the tables.  However, individuals served by rapid response—additional assistance 
funds are included. 
Table III-1 
to III-40 
These tables contain data on dislocated workers.   
There was a large increase in exiters from NEG projects from PY 2004 to PY 2005 and a 
decrease in subsequent years.  Most of these changes over time are due to a single NEG project 
in Texas (TX11), which increased from zero in PY 2004 to 65,209 in PY 2005 and then dropped 
to 20,936 in PY 2006 and 2,066 in PY 2007.  Some of the data for this NEG project are very 
different than the data for other dislocated workers, either in formula programs or NEG projects.  
Thus, the data are strongly affected by TX11.   
Table III-1  
to 
Table III-15 
These tables show the characteristics of exiters.  Most numbers shown are the percentages within 
the column heading.  Exceptions include the number of exiters shown in the first three rows, 
which are counts, and preprogram earnings and average highest grade completed, for which both 
averages and percentages within categories are shown. 
In calculating percentages, individuals with missing data on either the row or column heading are 
excluded.  Values of zero are excluded when calculating average preprogram quarterly earnings. 
Some characteristics, those shown under “Characteristics of Exiters who Received Intensive or 
Training Services,” are available only for individuals who received intensive or training services.  
Percentages for these characteristics are calculated within this smaller universe, again excluding 
missing data. 
See the notes for Tables I-4 to I-7 for a discussion of trends over time in the number of exiters. 
These tables show trends over time in the characteristics of exiters for both the state and the 
nation. 
Table III-1

Table III-2 
Table III-1 shows some substantial changes in exiter characteristics among columns.  Most of 
these changes occur because of a single NEG program in Texas (TX11).   
Table III-2 shows counts of exiters with particular characteristics.  These counts exclude missing 
data and cannot be used to compute the percentages in Table III-1.  Also, the counts for the 
characteristics under the heading “Characteristics of Exiters who Received Training or Intensive

to 
Table III-16 
Beginning with the PY 2005 WIASRD reporting of coenrollment in Wagner-Peyser and TAA 
was required.  This change in reporting explains most of the increase in coenrollment in partner 
programs, Wagner-Peyser, and TAA. 
Table III-15 shows some substantial changes in services among the columns.  Most of these 
changes occur because of a single NEG program in Texas (TX11).  See notes to Tables I-4 to I-7.

Table III-26 
This table shows services provided by state.  The column for number of exiters shows the count 
of exiters in the state.  The remaining columns show the percentage within the state that received 
the service identified by the column heading.  These values can be compared with the national 
values in the first row.  Thus, unlike most other tables, this table presents row percentages, not 
column percentages. 
The distribution among the service categories within a state may be strongly affected by policies 
and practices regarding payment for services by WIA and Wagner-Peyser and coenrollment 
between the two programs.  For example, Nebraska shows that 81.3% of exiters received 
training, possibly because Wagner-Peyser funds were used for core and intensive services.  
Conversely, 81.2% of exiters in New York received only core services, possibly because of 
extensive coenrollment with Wagner-Peyser. 
These tables calculate each outcome for the most recent year’s worth of exiters for whom the

shown are the percentages within the column heading.  Exceptions include the number of exiters 
shown in the first three rows, which are counts, and preprogram earnings and average highest 
grade completed, for which both averages and percentages within categories are shown. 
In calculating percentages, individuals with missing data on either the row or column heading are 
excluded.  Values of zero are excluded when calculating average preprogram earnings. 
Veteran and preprogram quarterly earnings are available only for older youth, those at least age 
19 at participation. 
These tables show trends over time in the characteristics of exiters for both the state and the 
nation. 
Table IV-1 
to 
Table IV-2 
Table IV-2 shows counts of exiters with particular characteristics.  These counts exclude missing 
data and cannot be used to compute the percentages in Table II-1.   
Table IV-12 
This table shows the characteristics of youth who received specific youth activities.  Youth who 
are not reported as receiving any of the youth activities are excluded from the table. 
Table IV-13  
to  
Table IV-23 
These tables show the services received by exiters.  Most numbers shown are the percentages 
within the column heading.  Exceptions include the number of exiters shown in the first row, 
which is a count, and weeks participated, for which both the average and percentages within 
categories are shown. 
The percentages for the youth activities are based on youth reported as receiving at least one of 
the activities. 
In calculating percentages, individuals with missing data on either the row or column heading are 
excluded.   
These tables show trends over time in the services received by exiters for both the state and the 
nation.

Table IV-14 
Beginning with the PY 2005 WIASRD reporting of coenrollment in Wagner-Peyser and TAA 
was required.  This change in reporting explains most of the increase in coenrollment in partner 
programs, Wagner-Peyser, and TAA. 
Table IV-24 
This table shows youth activities provided by state.  The column for number of exiters shows the 
count of exiters in the state.  The remaining columns show the percentage within the state that 
received the youth activity identified by the column heading.  These percentages are based on 
youth reported as receiving at least one of the youth activities.  These values can be compared 
with the national values in the first row.  Thus, unlike most other tables, this table presents row 
percentages, not column percentages. 
Table IV-25  
to 
Table IV-36 
These tables show outcomes attained by youth exiters.  Except in Tables IV-23 and 24, data for 
youth retention are for exiters from April 2008 to March 2009, data for diploma attainment and 
skill attainment are for exiters from April 2009 to March 2010, data for placement are for exiters 
from October 2008 to September 2009, data for attending secondary school at exit are for exiters 
from April 2008 to March 2009 , and data for literacy and numeracy gains are based on 
participation years that began between July 2007and June 2008. 
Individuals who were reported as institutionalized or deceased at exit, those who had medical 
conditions that precluded continued participation in WIA or entry into employment or continued 
participation in the program, those providing care to a family member with a health/medical 
condition that precludes entry into employment or continued participation in the program, 
returning Reservists who choose not to continue WIA services, and individuals who did not 
provide a valid Social Security number are excluded from the calculations.  However, they are

included in the number of exiters shown. 
All outcomes are calculated within the group defined by the column heading. 
 The first group of outcomes shown contains the youth common measures.   
 The second group contains additional outcomes for all youth.  These include detail on some 
of the data used in the computation of the common measures and additional outcomes.   
 The third group includes the older youth WIA performance measures.   
 The fourth group contains the younger youth WIA performance measures.  The skill 
attainment rate differs substantially from the official definition because it is based only on 
exiters and includes all goals set for the youth during the youth’s period of participation.  It 
is calculated as the total number of goals attained by the youth divided by the total number 
of goals set for the youth, excluding goals pending at exit for youth reported as 
institutionalized or deceased at exit and those who had medical conditions that precluded 
continued participation in WIA or entry into employment.   
See Appendix B for summary definitions of the outcomes.   
Most numbers shown are the percentages within the column heading.  Exceptions include the 
number of exiters.  The skill attainment rate is based on all goals set for youth identified by the 
column head.   
These tables show trends over time in the outcomes of WIA exiters for both the state and the 
nation. 
Table IV-25 
to 
Table IV-26 
Data for exiters from October 2008 to September 2009 are complete except for data on retention.  
Data on retention are for exiters from October 2008 to March 2009 . 
Data for exiters from April 2009 to March 2010 do not include data on retention.  Data on 
placement is for exiters from April 2009 to September 2009 . 
Data for literacy and numeracy gains below the heading “PY 2008” are based on participation 
years that began between July 2007 and June 2008; those below the heading “PY 2007” are 
based on participation years that began between July 2006 and June 2007. 
Table IV-25 shows the calculated outcomes, while Table IV-26 shows the number of exiters 
attaining positive outcomes.  The calculated outcomes in Table II-25 generally cannot be 
computed from the data in Table IV-26 due to exclusions from outcome measurement. 
These tables show outcomes on the youth common measures: placement in employment or 
education, attainment of a degree or certificate, and literacy and numeracy gains. 
Tables  
IV-37 to  
IV-39 
Placement in employment or education is based on exiters from October 2008 to September 2009 
who were not in post-secondary education or employment at the date of participation. 
Attainment of a degree or certificate is based on exiters from October 2008 to September 2009 
who were enrolled in education at the date of participation or at any point during the program. 
Literacy and numeracy gains is based on the definition for the third year of implementation and 
includes basic skills deficient out-of-school youth who began participation between July 2005 
and June 2008.

Table IV-39 
This table shows the youth common measures calculated within each state.  Placement in 
employment or education and attainment of a degree or certificate are given for exiters from 
October 2007 to September 2008, whereas literacy and numeracy gains is based on youth who 
began participation between July 2005 and June 2008.  However, youth who began participation 
in PY 2005 must have completed three years of participation to be included in PY 2008 literacy 
and numeracy and those who began in PY 2006 must have completed two years. 
The columns titled “Number of Exiters” or “Number of Youth” contain the number of youth in 
the group defined by the row heading.  The remaining columns show the three common 
calculated within the group of youth defined by the row heading.  All of the common measures 
are percentages. 
These common measures are calculated using WIASRD data and may differ, sometimes 
substantially, from the outcomes reported by the state in its PY 2007 Annual Report.  In 
particular, some states were in the second year of implementation for literacy and numeracy 
gains and reported that measure based on a different calculation in the PY 2007 Annual Report. 
See Appendix B for summary definitions of the common measures. 
Table IV-40 
This table shows the WIA younger youth performance measures calculated within detailed 
groups based on the characteristics of exiters.  The retention rate is based on exiters from April 
2008 to March 2009; diploma attainment and skill attainment are based on exiters from April 
2009 to March 2010. 
The columns titled “Number of Exiters” contain the number of exiters in the group defined by 
the row heading, within the relevant time period shown by the column heading.  The remaining 
columns show the three performance measures calculated within the group of exiters defined by 
the row heading, again for the time period shown by the column heading.  All of the performance 
measures are percentages.  However, the skill attainment rate is a percentage of all goals set for 
exiters, rather than of exiters.  This skill attainment rate is different from the official performance 
measure. 
See Appendix B for summary definitions of the performance measures and the notes to Tables 
IV-23 to IV-32 for more detail.   
Table IV-41 
This table shows the younger youth WIA performance measures calculated within detailed

This table shows the younger youth WIA performance measures for younger youth calculated 
within states.  See the notes to Table IV-33 and Tables IV-23 to IV-32 for more detail on the 
calculations and Appendix B for summary definitions of the performance measures.  The skill 
attainment rate differs from the official performance measure. 
Because these performance measures are calculated from WIASRD data, the numbers shown 
may differ, sometimes substantially, from the performance reported by the states in their PY 
2008 Annual Reports. 
Table IV-43 
This table shows the older youth WIA performance measures calculated within detailed groups 
based on the characteristics of exiters from two different cohorts of exiters.  The entered 
employment rate and credential rate performance measures are given for exiters from October 
2007 to September 2008, whereas the employment retention and earnings change performance 
measures are given for exiters from April 2007 to March 2008.  Using two cohorts ensures that 
each performance measure is calculated for the most recent year’s worth of exiters available.  
The columns titled “Number of Exiters” contain the number of exiters in the group defined by 
the row heading.  The remaining columns show the four performance measures calculated within 
the group of exiters defined by the row heading.  All of the performance measures, except 
earnings change, are percentages.

number of goals attained by the youth divided by the total 
number of goals set for the youth, excluding goals pending at 
exit for youth reported as institutionalized or deceased at exit 
and those who had medical conditions that precluded continued 
participation in WIA or entry into employment.
