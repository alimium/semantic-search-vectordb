An insured credit union, with the ap-
proval of its members, may convert to 
a mutual savings bank or a savings as-
sociation that is in mutual form with-
out the prior approval of the NCUA, 
subject to applicable law governing 
mutual savings banks and savings asso-
ciations and the other requirements of 
this part.
is clear which terms the requirement applies 
to. 
6. Guide to model clauses. In the model 
clauses, italicized words indicate the type of 
disclosure a credit union should insert in the 
space provided (for example, a credit union 
might insert ‘‘March 25, 1995’’ in the blank 
for ‘‘(date)’’ disclosure). Brackets and diago-
nals (‘‘/’’) indicate a credit union must 
choose the alternative that describes its 
practice (for example, [daily balance/average 
daily balance]). 
7. Sample forms. The sample forms (B–4 
through B–11) serve a purpose different from 
the model clauses. They illustrate various 
ways of adapting the model clauses to spe-
cific accounts. The clauses shown relate only 
to the specific transactions described.
