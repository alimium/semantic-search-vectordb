Commodity Movements Originating in West Virginia
Summary of 1993 CFS
In West Virginia, the CFS measured $35 billion of goods shipments weighing 234
million tons.  West Virginia accounted for approximately 1 percent of the value and 2
percent of the weight of total U.S. shipments.  See attached table.  The CFS data cover
shipments by establishments in mining, manufacturing, wholesale, and selected retail and
service industries.  The data exclude most shipments of crude oil; therefore, the totals and
percentages do not fully reflect the contribution of pipeline shipments.
The major commodities shipped by establishments vary when measured by value
and weight.  The main commodities originating in West Virginia by value were:
chemicals or allied products; coal; primary metal products; petroleum, or coal products;
and food or kindred products.  The main commodities by weight were:  coal; petroleum
or coal products; chemicals or allied products; nonmetallic minerals; and lumber or wood
products, excluding furniture.
Local transportation of freight is important to West Virginiaâ€™s commerce.  The
CFS shows that in 1993, about one-quarter of the value and over one-third of the weight
of total shipments from West Virginia were shipped to destinations within the state.
About 25 percent of the value and about 41 percent of the weight of all shipments were
between places less than 50 miles apart.  In comparison, about 30 percent of the value and
56 percent of the weight of total U.S. shipments were between places less than 50 miles
apart.  In West Virginia, about 39 percent of the value of shipments and 49 percent of the
weight of shipments were between places less than 100 miles apart.
Approximately three-quarters of the value and two-thirds of the weight of all
shipments from West Virginia went to other states.  The most important destination state
by value of shipments was Ohio.  Other important states by value were:  Virginia,
Pennsylvania, New York, and Kentucky.  Some of the most important destinations by
weight of shipments were:  Ohio, Virginia, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and North Carolina.
A large proportion of commodities were moved by trucks, about 65 percent of the
value and 29 percent of the weight.  Rail was also important, accounting for 14 percent of
the value and 43 percent of the weight of shipments.  Water transportation moved 5
percent of the value of shipments and 20 percent of the weight.

(Washington, DC: 1996).
The Commodity Flow Survey (CFS) is a comprehensive effort to learn where and
how goods are shipped in the U.S. The CFS measures shipments of commodities by
establishments with paid employees and engaged in manufacturing, mining, wholesale
trade, or selected retail and services industries. Prior commodity surveys covered
shipments only by manufacturing firms. Commodity flows are estimated for a universe of
approximately 900,000 establishments.
Data collected on individual shipments include total value, total weight,
commodity type, modes of transport, domestic origin and destination; data for export
shipments include the city and country of destination, mode and port of exit. Information
is also be obtained on whether shipments are containerized or a hazardous material. Some
firms provided data concerning on-site shipping facilities and access to shipping facilities,
plus data on ownership and leasing of transportation equipment.
The CFS is conducted by the Bureau of the Census as part of the Economic
Census. Funding and technical guidance is provided by the U.S. Department of
Transportation. Initiated for 1993, the CFS is scheduled for 1997 and every 5 years
thereafter for years ending in 2 and 7. Commodity surveys were conducted between 1963
and 1982, but data for 1982 were not published. No data were collected for 1987.
Participants will report for a sample of shipments during a 2-week period each quarter
during the reporting year.
The CFS is a mail-out/mail-back survey of 200,000 sampled employer
establishments in selected industries. Establishments were selected by stratified sample,
with strata based on geographic location and industry. Geographic strata are the 89
National Transportation Analysis Regions(NTARs), which provide nationwide coverage
and are aggregations of Bureau of Economic Analysis economic areas. Within the strata,
all establishments with annualized employment above a specified cutoff were selected
with certainty, and the remaining smaller establishments were sampled with probability
proportional to annualized payroll.
For 1993, each sampled establishment reported on a sample of individual
shipments during a 2 week period in each calendar quarter. In addition, about 20,000
establishments will provide information on transportation facilities and arrangements in
their final reporting period.
