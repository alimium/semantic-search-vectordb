Changes in Procedural Regulations Help to Streamline Appeals Before HAC
by Glenna Sheveland 
HAC Implements Changes to its
Regulatory Procedures
Effective July 2, 2004, the Housing Ap-
peals Committee (HAC) began imple-
mentation of new procedural rules
which allowed for, among other things,
a motion practice and the use of pre-
filed testimony. These procedural re-
forms were implemented as an affirma-
tive step towards reducing the backlog
of housing development proposals
pending before the HAC.
a backlog of appeals before the HAC.
To determine ways in which the appeal
process could be expedited, an Advi-
sory Committee was formed in August
of 2003, to review and recommend
changes to the procedural process that
had been in use, for the most part, by
HAC since its inception in 1969. The
Advisory Committee identified several
administrative and procedural changes
that it believed would substantially im-
prove the appeal process before the
HAC. The most significant changes pro-
posed included an increase in staffing
for the HAC, encouraging voluntary
settlement between the parties, and
changes in the procedural regulations
to include a motion practice and the
use of prefiled testimony.
Preliminary motions must be made
within 30 days after the initial confer-
ence of counsel. Municipalities should
look closely at the types of preliminary
motions available under 760 CMR
30.07, as they are predominately mo-
tions that a municipality would choose
to make. For example, a preliminary
motion may be made by the municipal-
ity to dismiss the appeal for failure of
the developer to meet the eligibility re-
quirements for approval of a compre-
hensive permit, or the municipality may
be able to show that it has met one of
the statutorily defined minimal require-
ments for affordable housing, or the
municipality may show that the devel-
oper had attempted to file for a com-
prehensive permit within 12 months of
having been denied or having volun-
tarily withdrawn a request for variance,
special permit, or subdivision approval
for the same piece of property and that
the prior proposal included no signifi-
cant amount of low- or moderate-

Inside This Issue
From the Deputy Commissioner . . . . . . . . . . . 2
Background
The Massachusetts Comprehensive
Permit Law (M.G.L. Chapter 40B, Secs.
20–23) was enacted in 1969 to promote
the construction of low- and moderate-
income housing. The law envisions that
municipalities will work with developers
to create affordable housing for individ-
uals who would otherwise not be able
to afford such an opportunity. The Com-
prehensive Permit Law also allows for
an expedited administrative appeal to
the HAC whenever a comprehensive
permit is denied by a municipality or
granted with conditions that might ren-
der construction of the proposed hous-
ing uneconomic and therefore imprac-
tical to build.

A decrease in available buildable land,
an increase in restrictive local regula-
tions, and most importantly, a change
in the availability of qualifying funding
sources, have all led to an intensified
interest by developers in the use of the
comprehensive permit process as a
means by which to develop new hous-
ing throughout the Commonwealth.
This increased demand for compre-
hensive permits in turn had resulted in
Addition of a Motion Practice
Although not yet quantified, it is be-
lieved that the expansion of the motion
practice has had an unexpected im-
pact on the comprehensive permit ap-
peal process. In fact, it is currently sug-
gested that the motion practice has
had the effect of promoting voluntary
settlement through the early resolution
of issues that are either purely proce-
dural considerations or are based on
previously resolved substantive issues
of law. Although motions can be made
orally, under the new procedures they
are usually made in writing. The prac-
tice also allows the parties to request a
hearing on the motion, which may be
held at the discretion of the presiding
officer. The hearing officer may also
decide to deny the motion without prej-
udice or wait to decide the motion until
completion of the hearing in the interest
of expediting the hearing on the merits.

would have to be reallocated from other

meet the minimum staffing obligation.
Municipal Collective
Bargaining Request
for Funding
Obligations
During the certifi-
cation process the
Bureau of Local
Assessment has
noticed that some
assessors do not
make valuation changes as a result
of issues revealed during the public
disclosure process. Some assessors
actually discourage taxpayers from
reporting valuation matters until the
abatement process.
The union sought an injunction, pur-
suant to Billerica v. International Asso-
ciation of Firefighters, Local 1495, 415
Mass. 692 (1993), to require an uncon-
ditional appropriation request. A supe-
rior court judge so ordered and the
town complied, but appealed the deci-
sion. The town voted to fund the provi-
sion, but also voted the override. The
union requested the case be dismissed
as moot, but the SJC agreed to a review
to decide the issue as one that would
be likely to recur and was in need of
clarification.
by Gary A. Blau
In the case of Local 1652, International
Association of Firefighters v. Town of
Framingham, 442 Mass 463 (2004),
the Supreme Judicial Court (SJC) ruled
that the town bargaining representa-
tives’ request for funding an executed
collective bargaining agreement could
not be made contingent upon the pas-
sage of a Proposition 21⁄2 override. In
this 4–3 decision, the majority ruled that
the collective bargaining law, M.G.L.
Ch. 150E, Sec. 7(b) required that when
an agreement was reached between a
union and the town’s chief executive of-
ficers, those officers must submit an
unconditional request for funding to the
legislative body.
The Division of Local Services dis-
courages these practices because
we believe they are shortsighted.
Waiting for the abatement process
to act is problematic for two reasons.
First, an early review of taxpayer’s
complaints can lead to the revelation
of a systemic valuation problem. If it
is not corrected as a result of the dis-
closure period then only complaining
taxpayers who file abatements can
be remedied while all other taxpayers
with comparable problems are not
afforded similar treatment. Second,
making changes during the disclo-
sure process does not affect overlay
balances. Waiting until the tax rate
has been set wastes money on
abatements that could be used for
productive community purposes.
The SJC held that the contingent appro-
priation request was not a good faith
request to fully fund the contract. The
majority reviewed the preceding case
law concerning minimum staffing pro-
visions, which had held they were sub-
ject to annual appropriation. Billerica,
supra & Boston Teacher’s Union, Local
66 v. Boston, 382 Mass. 553 (1981) &
386 Mass. 197 (1982). Nevertheless, in
such circumstances the town executive
officers are required to request funding
of the minimum staffing provisions and
to support the request, citing several
Massachusetts Labor Relations Com-
mission decisions.
Consequently, if the Bureau feels that
insufficient time or attention has been
given to the disclosure process,
including not making the requisite
changes prior to tax rate setting, it will
insist that assessors rectify the prob-
lem prior to final certification. Asses-
sors are encouraged to review the
public disclosure section of the Guide-
lines for Development of a Minimum
Reassessment Program on pages
18–19 for compliance.
Gerard D. Perry
Deputy Commissioner
The SJC majority ruled that nothing in
M.G.L. Ch. 59, Sec. 21C(m) authorizes
the board of selectmen to submit a bud-
get contingent on an override and that
it is town meeting that may make such
contingent appropriations. However,
the majority did acknowledge the role
of the finance committee in making
budget recommendations. The majority
also found that although M.G.L. Ch. 59,
Sec. 21C(m) was not listed in M.G.L.
The facts of the case are straightfor-
ward. The town and firefighters’ union
entered into a collective bargaining
agreement for July 1, 2000 through
June 30, 2003, which included a mini-
mum staffing provision requiring 30 fire-
fighters per shift. In FY02, the second
year of the contract, a 7 percent bud-
get shortfall was projected. The town
manager and board of selectmen pro-
posed a budget requesting funds to
cover the minimum staffing provision
(and to restore all projected budget
cuts), but made the funding vote con-
tingent on the passage of an override
under M.G.L. Ch. 59, Sec. 21C(m). Al-
ternatively, the manager and selectmen
proposed a balanced budget within the
town’s levy limit under M.G.L. Ch. 59,
Sec. 21C (Proposition 2 1⁄ 2), which
would cut all town departments by 7
percent and therefore would not be suf-
ficient to fund the minimum staffing pro-
vision as proposed. The manager and

by Scott Dressel
This Focus article reviews fiscal year
2005 single-family tax bills and property
values across the Commonwealth. As in
previous years, this article ranks com-
munities statewide. It also highlights
some major trends and discusses the
impact on single-family tax bills. The
analyses are based on FY05 data re-
ported to the Department of Revenue’s
Division of Local Services (DLS) by the
local assessors.
Furthermore, the share of the total tax
burden borne by residential property
owners has increased in each of the
past five years, from 67.9 percent in
1999 to 72.1 percent in 2005. This is
mainly due to the fact that commercial,
industrial, and personal (CIP) property
values have not kept pace with the in-
creasing residential values. It also re-
flects the rollback of Chapter 3 of the
Acts of 2004.
Average single-family tax bills are cal-
culated by summing the assessed
value of all of the single-family parcels
of each community. Dividing this total
by the number of parcels results in the
average single-family property value.
The average value is divided by one
thousand and then multiplied by the
residential tax rate.
Statewide Trends
Over each of the past 10 years, the av-
erage single-family tax bill has in-
creased in both constant and actual
dollars (see Figure 2). In actual dollars,
the annual increase over the prior
year’s tax bill has ranged from 3.8 per-
cent in 1999 to 6.7 percent in 2002. In
2005, the average bill increased by 5.2
percent. This trend has continued even
as the average single-family tax rate
across the Commonwealth has de-
creased in each of the past seven
years from a high of $14.92 per $1,000
in 1998 to $10.17 per $1,000 in 2005.
Much of the increase in the average bill
is attributable to rising residential as-
sessed values, stagnant growth in the
commercial and industrial sectors, and
relatively flat state aid budgets.
The average single-family property
value realized a double-digit increase
The 11 cities and towns that have
adopted a residential exemption are
not included in this analysis because
FY2005 Average Single Family Tax Bill
Several “split rate” communities
adopted Chapter 3 of the Acts of 2004,
temporarily allowing them to increase
the amount by which they shift the tax
burden to CIP taxpayers. Before this
provision, these communities were re-
stricted from taxing CIP properties more
than 175 percent of the taxes they
would have paid under a single rate.
The provision temporarily increased this
limit to 200 percent but started to roll it
back in 2005. By 2009 the communities
that adopted the increased shift will be
allowed a maximum CIP percentage of
170, down from the preexisting 175.
This will likely add to the weight of the
tax burden on residential taxpayers in
these communities.

Aggregate state aid across the Com-
monwealth increased from about $4.81
billion in 2004 to $4.95 billion in 2005.
As far back as 2002, the figure was
about $5.13 billion. Clearly, state aid
has not kept pace with 2002 growing
costs and services. This puts pressure
on cities and towns to cover their ex-
panding needs through using unused
levy capacity or pursuing overrides.

to the maximum allowable levy for
cities and towns and therefore directly
impacts the tax bill.

Figures 2 and 3
The five communities with the highest
average tax bills in FY04 retained their
rankings in FY05. They are: Weston
($11,767), Sherborn ($9,889), Lincoln
($9,730), Carlisle ($9,224), and Dover
($9,004). Not surprisingly, these towns
also all ranked among the highest with
respect to average assessed property
value. The five communities with the
lowest tax bills also remained un-
changed: Rowe ($512), Erving ($908),
Florida ($940), Tolland ($1,040), and
Monroe ($1,106). These towns are all
in the lower 20 percent of average as-
sessed values. Statewide, the correla-
tion between the average tax bill and
average assessed value is generally
strong with a few exceptions. For ex-
ample, communities on the Cape and
Islands tend to have high assessed
values but lower tax bills due to the
large number of seasonal properties
whose residents have a lower demand
for services. An even stronger correla-
tion exists between average household
income and average tax bill. All but

quires three price quotations. Contracts
costing $5,000 or less must be entered
into using sound business practices.
Procurement of
Banking Services
OIG recommends that all banking serv-
ices be procured competitively. Having
banks compete over a municipality’s
business allows a treasurer to assess
what is available and ensures that the
municipality is getting the best value.
Additionally, the need to re-procure
services prompts a review of the need
for those services and the quality of the
services currently being received.
There are seven exemptions to Chapter
30B that are relevant to municipal trea-
surers. For example, banking services
obtained under a compensating bal-
ance agreement are governed by
M.G.L. Ch. 44, Section 53F and there-
fore exempt from Chapter 30B. The De-
partment of Revenue, Division of Local
Services, Bureau of Accounts is respon-
sible for the interpretation and enforce-
ment of the compensating balance law.
Massachusetts Office of the Inspector General
The Office of the Inspector General
(OIG) has issued Banking Services
Procurement Guide for Local Govern-
ment Treasurers to clarify the pro-
curement rules for obtaining banking
services. The guide provides a brief
overview of M.G.L. Ch. 30B, provides
recommendations for banking service
procurement, and identifies resources
for local officials.
This Office recommends that munici-
palities always enter into written agree-
ments or contracts for banking serv-
ices. A written agreement, contract, or
any written documentation between a
municipality and a bank can ensure that
the municipality is fully complying with
public records requirements as well as
meeting the responsibility of sound
business practices.
The Commonwealth’s cities and towns
may obtain a wide range of services
from banking institutions including col-
lection services, depository account
services, disbursement services, credit
services and investment services.
Chapter 30B, the Uniform Procurement
Act, establishes procedures that most
local government jurisdictions must fol-
low for the acquisition and disposition
of supplies, equipment, services, and
real property.
Additionally, the issuance of bonds,
notes, or securities is exempt from
Chapter 30B. The following services
can safely be considered to be a part
of a bond issuance: structuring of the
maturity schedule; preparation of the
official statement; verifying legal docu-
ments; the acquisition of a credit rating;
the obtaining of approval from govern-
ment agencies; the advertisement of
the proposed sale; the distribution of
the official statement to potential bid-
ders; and the filing of initial and annual
disclosure documents with federal and
state regulatory agencies.
Finally, the OIG recommends that trea-
surers consider the protection of the
taxpayer’s money. When taking a risk
with taxpayers’ money, it is imperative
that the risk be an educated one. There-
fore, treasurers should conduct a thor-
ough review of the qualifications, expe-
rience, and expertise of any financial/
investment advisor and/or consultant.
Numerous recommendations are pro-
vided in the guide for jurisdictions to
follow for all banking service procure-
ments and contracts. For example, the

Chapter 30B requires a competitive
procurement process using an Invita-
tion for Bids or Request for Proposals
for banking service contracts estimated
to cost $25,000 or more. For contracts
estimated to cost less than $25,000,
but more than $5,000, Chapter 30B re-

in 2005. There were 64 cities and towns
in which the average value increased
by less than 5 percent. However, of the
148 communities that had increases
above the statewide average (14.8 per-
cent), 56 communities had increases
greater than 30 percent. Of these, 15
were greater than 50 percent. Swansea,
Royalston, and Stockbridge each ex-
perienced increases above 70 percent.
In FY05, 11 communities experienced
increases in their average tax bills that
were greater than 15 percent (ranging
from 15.3 percent to 28.1 percent). All
but one of these communities also saw
their average assessed values increase
by at least 10 percent. Four of the
eleven successfully passed Proposition
21⁄2 overrides.
in 2005. Only one of the 64 communi-
ties with increases under 5 percent had
a recertification in 2005. Of the cities
and towns below the statewide increase
average, 82 percent were also non-
certification communities. These figures
reflect the fact that leading up to 2005,
several communities were not yet per-
forming interim year adjustments to val-
ues. Now that interim year adjustments
are required for all communities, such
sudden and uneven jumps in average
assessed value should not occur as
frequently. ■

sessed values show a correlation to

ule. All but six of the 56 communities

prehearing conference. Witnesses
whose testimony is prefiled will be re-
quired to appear for cross-examination
during the hearing, unless the parties
agree otherwise. All cross-examination
will now normally be completed on con-
secutive days, which will also aid in ex-
pediting the hearing process. In con-
junction with the prefiled testimony, a
party may make a motion for directed
decision in its favor after the submission
of prefiled testimony, on the grounds
that upon the facts or the law the non-
moving party has failed to prove a ma-
terial element of its case or defense.
Ch.150E, Sec. 7(d) as a provision su-
perceded by a conflicting provision of a
collective bargaining agreement, sec-
tion 7(d) listed only statutes specifically
dealing with terms and conditions of
employment, which are the only such
provisions intended to be superceded
by such an agreement. M.G.L. Ch. 59,
Sec. 21C(m) is not a statute dealing
with terms and conditions of employ-
ment, but is a provision intended to au-
thorize appropriations contingent on a
ballot vote to override the tax levy limits
imposed by law. The town cited several
cases that said the labor relations com-
mission would not dictate the funding
source of an appropriation request, but
in all the cases the commission had re-
quired the towns to submit a full fund-
ing request.
Either party may also submit a motion
for summary decision at any time prior
to the conclusion of the formal hearing
proceedings. This may be done with or
without supporting affidavits or memo-
randum of law. The motion may request
that the hearing officer decide all or
only part of the issues in dispute. The
amount of time necessary for the HAC
to render a decision on summary deci-
sion varies based on the nature and
number of arguments presented and
whether the decision will be dispositive
of the entire appeal, which might require
review and a vote by the full Committee.
Promoting Affordable Housing
Since its enactment, the Comprehen-
sive Permit Law has been an effective
means by which to ensure the contin-
ued construction of affordable housing.
It has been estimated that this law has
resulted in the development of more
than 30,000 housing units in approxi-
mately 200 Massachusetts cities and
towns. The changes in procedure dis-
cussed herein have resulted both in a
decrease in the amount of time needed
to resolve an appeal and also appear
to be promoting the resolution of cases
through voluntary settlement. Municipal-
ities can access Recent Decisions by
the HAC, as well as review its Regula-
tions, Standing Orders and Guidelines

Permits at www.mass.gov/dhcd/com

The dissent emphasized that contingent
appropriations had become a regular
tool in the budgeting process and that
it could be harmonized with chapter
150E. Justice Sosman pointed out that
many appropriations required steps
from other parties before they might be
finalized, and a Proposition 21⁄2 contin-
gent request was merely one such ap-
propriation. The dissent further sug-
gested that eliminating this provision
might make more executive officers re-
luctant to agree to minimum staffing
provisions in the future. It pointed out
that in this case there was no claim
that the executive officers did not fully
support the appropriation and the
override vote.

The Use of Prefiled Direct Testimony
In addition to the use of the motions
practice, prefiled testimony reduces
the amount of time needed for disposi-
tion of an appeal by limiting the hear-
ing to cross-examination on the issues
established as part of the prefiled testi-
mony. However, this procedure is not
necessarily appropriate for all cases.
Occasionally the presiding officer may
determine that it is more appropriate to
require that all of the testimony in a par-
ticular case be oral testimony. Dead-
lines for prefiled testimony are estab-
lished by HAC Standing Order No.

Finally, while the case does require the
executive officers to place a non-con-
tingent article on the warrant to fund a
minimum staffing provision, it did not
require the town meeting to take a non-
contingent vote. The finance committee
still appears free to move that the vote
be made contingent on passage of an
override, as well as any town citizen,
and town meeting could so vote. ■

DLS Update
Graziano and Sandell Earn
Designation
Deputy Commissioner Gerard D. Perry
has announced that Joanne Graziano
and Grace Sandell of the Bureau of
Local Assessment have earned the In-
ternational Association of Assessing
Officers’ (IAAO) designation of Assess-
ment Administration Specialist (AAS).
Joanne is the Bureau’s certification su-
pervisor and Grace is a certification
advisor.
Municipal Job Duties Online
The Division of Local Services’ (DLS)
Technical Assistance Section has pub-
lished a list of the legal duties and
responsibilities of the accountant, trea-
surer, collector and the assessing de-
partment on the DLS website (www.
mass.gov/dls). This information on “Job
Responsibilities” is listed under the
heading “Financial Management As-
sistance.” The direct link is www.mass.
gov/dls/mdmstuf/Technical_Assist
ance/Jobs/jobs_index.htm.
Schedule A Reminder
Schedule A is a detailed statement of
revenues and expenditures that cities
and towns must prepare and submit to
the Department of Revenue each fiscal
year no later than October 31. Town ac-
countants and city auditors usually are
responsible for completing Schedule
A. This information is added to the Di-
vision of Local Services’ (DLS) Munici-
pal Data Bank, and is used by many
state agencies and the Legislature for
research and analysis of various pro-
grams. DLS also provides Schedule A
data to the U.S. Census Bureau for use
by federal agencies.
According to the IAAO, “[T]he purpose
of the AAS designation is to recognize
professionalism and competency in ad-
ministration of a variety of functions for
property tax purposes.”
The duties and responsibilities of mu-
nicipal finance officers, as well as ap-
pointed or elected boards, are rooted in
state law and regulations. Explanations
and guidelines are also included in op-
erations manuals published by the var-
ious professional organizations, often
times in collaboration with DLS.
This section summarizes, and provides
links to the legal citations of, funda-
mental job responsibilities for financial
officers that are critical to sound finan-
cial management practices.
To qualify for the AAS designation can-
didates must fulfill certain requirements,
such as successful completion of sev-
eral IAAO courses, an assessment ad-
ministration case study examination,
and have at least three years’ experi-
ence in the assessment field. The can-
didate must also pass a four-hour AAS
master examination.
Section 3 of the state budget autho-
rizes the Commissioner of Revenue to
delay payment of state aid to cities
and towns that miss the filing deadline.
In January and May 2005, DLS sent re-
minders to several communities advis-
ing them to submit these reports or
face a delay in receiving local aid pay-
ments. Some communities complied
with this notice. Others experienced
delays in receiving their third and fourth
quarter state aid payments because
they still had not submitted Schedule A.
Marilyn H. Browne, chief of the Bureau
of Local Assessment, said, “Joanne
and Grace’s most recent achievement
exemplify their professionalism and
steadfast search for knowledge in the
appraisal and assessment administra-
tion fields. They are to be commended.”
In addition to Job Responsibilities,
other sections under Financial Man-
agement Assistance include Best
Practices, Restructuring City and Town
Government, and Benchmarks and
Spreadsheets. This site also includes
links to the Open Meeting Law Guide-
lines, the School Building Authority, the
Massachusetts General Laws and var-
ious DLS publications. ■
Deputy Commissioner Gerard D. Perry
is urging cities and towns to make
every effort to comply with the Sched-
ule A filing deadline. If your community
experiences any problem with filing the
Schedule A, your Bureau of Accounts
field representative is available to offer
assistance or answer questions regard-
ing this matter.
Joanne has worked for the Division of
Local Services for four years and su-
pervises a staff of 10 appraisal certifi-
cation advisors who work in the Boston

for the Division for almost seven years.
She works with assessors in 34 com-
munities located on the South Shore,

DLS Profile: Executive Director, Springfield
Finance Control Board
In July 2004 the governor and the state Legislature
established a Finance Control Board to oversee the
operations of the City of Springfield. What was esti-
mated at that time to be a budget deficit of $22 mil-
lion for FY05 was discovered, after the initial review
of the city’s financial accounts, to be $41 million.
State Revenues
Eclipse Expectations
by $436 Million in FY05
Revenue Commissioner Alan LeBov-
idge announced that preliminary rev-
enue collections for FY05 were $17.086
billion, an increase of $1.133 billion or
7.1 percent over FY04. Total tax collec-
tions for FY05 exceeded the revised
yearly benchmark by $436 million. It
was the first time the Department of
Revenue had collected $17 billion in a
fiscal year
Philip Puccia
With 13 years of senior executive experience, Philip
Puccia was hired by the control board in August
2004 to turn around Springfield’s fortunes. Before
coming to the control board, Phil spent two years as
vice president of operations and general manager of
a smart card company. He was also the managing
director of a consulting and investment banking prac-
tice that focused on transportation. In the 1990s, he
worked in various management positions for the
Commonwealth in the Highway Department, Execu-
tive Office of Transportation and Massachusetts Bay
Transportation Authority (MBTA).
“All tax types had improved collections
in FY05,” LeBovidge said. “Only sales
and use tax fell below the yearly esti-
mate and that was due to a one-time
accounting adjustment of $18 million.
Income tax collections accounted for
much of the increase versus the
benchmark.”
In an interview in BusinessWest (available online at www.businesswest.com/
arch3.05a/index.html), Puccia compared the fiscal crisis in Springfield to the prob-
lems he faced at the MBTA. “When I arrived at the MBTA…[t]here was a $40 million
budget deficit….What you found was …a management culture that didn’t focus
on performance and accountability. And no one paid attention to the bottom line.”
Income tax collections for FY05 totaled
$9.690 billion, an increase of $860 mil-
lion or 9.7 percent over FY04. With-
holding tax collections totaled $7.674
billion, an increase of $306 million or
4.1 percent. Sales and use tax collec-
tions were $3.886 billion, up $137 mil-
lion or 3.7 percent. Corporate and
business tax collections totaled $1.706
billion, an increase of $31 million or 1.8
percent. ■
Puccia went on to say that turning around Springfield’s fortunes involves more than
cutting expenses and raising revenues. “It is also seeking something that has been
missing from the equation of Springfield’s municipal operations — accountability.”
However, over the past year, Puccia said that the control board has taken a number
of steps to reduce health care costs and day-to-day spending. Also, the control
board is working to promote accountability and efficiency by reorganizing the
structure of the city’s government.
In his FY06 budget message, Puccia said “we still have far to go.” The FY06 pro-
visional budget, without the inclusion of employee raises, projects a deficit of ap-
proximately $6.5 million.

While Puccia emphasizes that there is still a lot of hard work to do, he said that he
enjoys a close working relationship with Mayor Charles Ryan and his senior staff.
“That relationship has served us well in meeting the challenges that we have had
to face over the past year.”
