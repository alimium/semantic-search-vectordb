“Net lending or net borrowing (–)” is an alternative 
measure of the government fiscal position. Net bor­
rowing is the financing requirement of the government 
sector, and it is derived as net government saving plus 
the consumption of fixed capital and net capital trans­
fers received less gross investment and net purchases of 
nonproduced assets.

Personal current taxes decelerated in the second quar­
ter because of decelerations in both withheld and non-
withheld income taxes. 
 
 
Taxes on corporate income turned down as a result of 
a decrease in domestic corporate profits before tax. 
 
 
 
Contributions for government social insurance turned 
up, reflecting an upturn in contributions for social se­
curity. First-quarter contributions were lowered by the 
reduction in the social security contribution rate. 
National defense expenditures turned up in the sec­
ond quarter, reflecting upturns in durable goods and 
services. 
 
 
Government social benefits to persons turned up as a 
result of an acceleration in social security benefits, and 
a smaller decrease in unemployment benefits. Refund­
able tax credits remained unchanged after decreasing. 
 
 
Grants-in-aid to state and local governments turned 
up, reflecting a smaller decrease in Medicaid grants, an 
upturn in welfare and social grants, and an accelera­
tion in education grants. 
 
 
Interest payments accelerated, reflecting an accelera­
tion in inflation expense payments on Treasury Infla­
tion-Protected Securities. 
Gross government investment decreased less, reflect­
ing an upturn in defense equipment and software.

3.4–3.8, 3.12, and 3.13. Detailed quarterly estimates are 
available in underlying NIPA tables at www.bea.gov/ 
national/nipaweb/nipa_underlying/Index.asp.
 Each year, BEA translates the information in the federal 
budget into a NIPA framework.1 For a historical time series 
of these estimates, see NIPA table 3.18B, which is scheduled 
to be published in the October 2011 SURVEY. 
1. See Mark S. Ludwick and Andrea L. Cook, “NIPA Translation of the 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fiscal Year 2012 Federal Budget,” SURVEY OF CURRENT BUSINESS 91 (March 
2011): 12–21. 
 
 
 
Estimates of federal government current receipts, current 
expenditures, and net federal government saving are based 
on data from the federal budget, from the Monthly Treasury 
Statement and other reports from the Department of the 
Treasury, and from other federal government agencies. 
Total receipts, total expenditures, and net lending or net 
borrowing, which are alternative measures of the federal 
fiscal position, are based on these same sources. 
Quarterly and annual estimates are published monthly in 
NIPA table 3.2. Detailed annual estimates of these transac­
tions by component are published annually in NIPA tables

BEA also prepares annual estimates of receipts and

governments 
and 
of 
local 
governments.1 These estimates are available annually in 
NIPA table 3.20 (state government receipts and expen­

the October 2010 SURVEY.

of Local Governments,” SURVEY 85 (October 2005): 5–10. 
The estimates of state and local government current re­
ceipts and expenditures and total receipts and expenditures 
are mainly based on compilations of data for state and local 
government finances. The Census Bureau produces the pri­
mary source data: the census of governments that is con­
ducted in years that end in a 2 or a 7 and the Government 
Finances series of surveys for the other years. In addition, 
other sources of Census Bureau data are from the Quarterly 
Summary of State and Local Government Tax Revenue and 
the monthly Value of Construction Put in Place. Data 
sources from the Bureau of Labor Statistics include the 
Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages and the 
Employment Cost Index. 
Quarterly and annual estimates are available monthly in 
NIPA table 3.3. Detailed annual estimates of state and 
local government transactions by component are available
