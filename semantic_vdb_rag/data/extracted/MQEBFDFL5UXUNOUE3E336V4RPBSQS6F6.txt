Agency Information Collection 
Activities; Submission to OMB for 
Review and Approval; Comment 
Request; Exclusion Determinations for 
New Non-road Spark-Ignited Engines, 
New Non-road Compression-Ignited 
Engines and New On-Road Heavy Duty 
Engines (Renewal); EPA ICR No. 
1852.04, OMB Control No. 2060–0395 
AGENCY: Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA). 
ACTION: Notice. 
SUMMARY: In compliance with the 
Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA)(44 
U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), this document 
announces that an Information 
Collection Request (ICR) has been 
forwarded to the Office of Management 
and Budget (OMB) for review and 
approval. This is a request to renew an 
existing approved collection. The ICR, 
which is abstracted below, describes the 
nature of the information collection and 
its estimated burden and cost. 
DATES: Additional comments may be 
submitted on or before March 26, 2009. 
Title: Exclusion Determinations for 
New Non-road Spark-Ignited Engines, 
New Non-road Compression-Ignited 
Engines and New On-Road Heavy Duty 
Engines (Renewal). 
ICR numbers: EPA ICR No. 1852.04, 
OMB Control No. 2060–0395. 
ICR Status: This ICR is scheduled to 
expire on February 28, 2009. Under 
OMB regulations, the Agency may 
continue to conduct or sponsor the 
collection of information while this 
submission is pending at OMB. An 
Agency may not conduct or sponsor, 
and a person is not required to respond 
to, a collection of information, unless it 
displays a currently valid OMB control 
number. The OMB control numbers for 
EPA’s regulations in title 40 of the CFR, 
after appearing in the Federal Register 
when approved, are listed in 40 CFR 
part 9, and are displayed either by 
publication in the Federal Register or 
by other appropriate means, such as on 
the related collection instrument or 
form, if applicable. The display of OMB 
control numbers in certain EPA 
regulations is consolidated in 40 CFR 
part 9. 
Abstract: Under the provisions of the 
Clean Air Act (Act), the Administrator 
is required to promulgate regulations to 
control air pollutant emissions from 
‘‘motor vehicles’’ and ‘‘non-road 
engines,’’ as defined in the Act. Motor 
vehicles and non-road engines not 
meeting the applicable definitions are 
excluded from compliance with current 
regulations. 
A manufacturer may make an 
exclusion determination by itself; 
however, manufacturers and importers 
may routinely request EPA to make such 
determination to ensure that their 
determination does not differ from the 
Agency’s. To request an exclusion 
determination, manufacturers submit a 
letter with a description of the engine 
and/or vehicle (engine type, horsepower 
rating, intended usage etc.) and sales 
brochures to EPA. EPA uses this 
information to determine whether the 
engine or vehicle is excluded from 
compliance with one or more emission 
regulations. EPA then stores the data in 
its internal files, and makes it available 
to environmental groups and the public 
upon request under the Freedom of 
Information Act. 
Burden Statement: The annual public 
reporting and recordkeeping burden for 
this collection of information is 
estimated to average 6 hours per 
response. Burden means the total time, 
effort, or financial resources expended 
by persons to generate, maintain, retain, 
or disclose or provide information to or 
for a Federal agency. This includes the 
time needed to review instructions; 
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: EPA has 
submitted the following ICR to OMB for 
review and approval according to the 
procedures prescribed in 5 CFR 1320.12. 
On June 30, 2008 (73 FR 36863), EPA 
sought comments on this ICR pursuant 
to 5 CFR 1320.8(d). EPA received no 
comments. Any additional comments on 
this ICR should be submitted to EPA 
and OMB within 30 days of this notice.
