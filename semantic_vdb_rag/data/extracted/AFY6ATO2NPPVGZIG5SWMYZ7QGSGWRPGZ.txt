Flow Loop Review
• 1 cm dia nozzle, 20 m/s jet requires 1.57 liter/sec 
mercury flow (94.2 liter/min, 24.9 gpm).
• MERIT experiment showed that a pump discharge 
pressure of ~40 bar required to produce the desired jet.
• Basic flow scheme

Gravity Drain Requires Flow Control
• Bulk flow exits dump 
via overflow drains
• Gravity drain 
intended to remain 
closed until end-of 
run, but this liquid 
becomes static
• Decay heating 
requires gravity 
drain to have flow 
control 
– Chamber must encompass the nozzle tip
– Mercury flows in a closed loop
– Likely will be double-walled for mercury containment, possibly water cooled
– Nozzle
– Hg drains (overflow and maintenance)
– Vents (in and out)
– Beam windows (upstream and downstream)
– Cooling?

Mercury Chamber Basics
• Chamber serves as both jet and beam dumps
• No openings into chamber during operation
• No embedded sensors
• Gravity drain of mercury required
• Penetrations (ports) into chamber
Drain Chamber
Drain Pipes
Drain Slots
• Splash mitigation not shown
• Size of drainage system outlets TBD

Mercury Chamber Ports
• Chamber requires 
several ports
• Sizes likely to 
increase due to 
remote handling 
requirements

Chamber Relative to Existing Coils
• Sized to locate drain pipes 
below resistive magnets
• No beam pipe shown
• Severely impacts tungsten 
shielding
• Chamber shape requires 
significant increase in 
complexity
• Integrating resistive magnets 
and chamber into a single 
module likely to be required
– Dictates the location of 
upstream accelerator
– Ramifications of inaccurate 
field map?

Upstream Solenoids Affect Design
• Long piping required
• Remote removal / 
insertion more difficult
• Beam trajectory impacted
• More utility connections 
interfere with beam path
