Frequently Asked Questions
1.
What are the federal line references on the worksheet used for?
You must determine what portion of each line on the federal return is Missouri Source Income. The federal line references will help you find the information needed on
Lines A through R.
2.
What is Missouri source income and how do I determine the Missouri source income for myself and my spouse?
Missouri source income is the income earned in Missouri. It includes: (1) wages earned in Missouri; (2) income from business, trade profession or occupation carried
on in Missouri; (3) income from real or tangible personal property in Missouri; and (4) interest, dividends and pension income received during the time you/your spouse
was a Missouri resident. You should use the schedule on page 6 of the Form MO-1040C and on page 4 of the Form MO-1040 to allocate your income between you
and your spouse. You should determine what portion of each line on your federal income tax return is Missouri source income for yourself and your spouse and enter
on the appropriate line on the worksheet above.
3.
If I have only rental property in Missouri, do I have to complete the Form MO-NRI?
YES!! The amount of rental income received from a Missouri property is taxable to Missouri, if $600 or more.
4.
Should I enclose a copy of my federal return?
YES!!  A copy of your federal return is needed to verify information and may prevent a delay in the processing of your Missouri return.
5.
If I am in the military, stationed in Missouri, but my home of record is not Missouri and my spouse had Missouri source income, is he/she required to
complete the Form MO-NRI?
YES!  Both of you need to complete the Form MO-NRI. If you had military income only, your Missouri income percentage would be 0 percent. If your spouse’s
total income was Missouri source, 100 percent should be entered as the Missouri income percentage. As a nonresident of Missouri, any income from a Missouri
source (excluding military pay) will be taxed by Missouri. The Form MO-NRI should be completed to indicate your and your spouse’s Missouri income percentage.
6.
If I have a Missouri domicile and I am stationed outside of Missouri, but my spouse remained in Missouri, do I have to pay Missouri tax on my military
income?
YES!  100 percent of your military income and your spouse’s income would be taxable to Missouri.
Under penalties of perjury, I declare that I have examined this form and to the best of my knowledge and belief it is true, correct and complete. Declaration of preparer (other than taxpayer) is based on all information of
which he/she has any knowledge. As provided in Chapter 143, RSMo, a penalty of up to $500 shall be imposed on any individual who files a frivolous return.
