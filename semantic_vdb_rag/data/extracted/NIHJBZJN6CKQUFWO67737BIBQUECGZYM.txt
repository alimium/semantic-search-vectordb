Standard CRA Definitions and Common Abbreviations
The following terms and abbreviations are used throughout this performance evaluation, including the CRA
tables.  The definitions are intended to provide the reader with a general understanding of the terms, not a strict
legal definition.
Affiliate:  Any company that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with another company.  A
company is under common control with another company if the same company directly or indirectly controls both
companies.  A bank subsidiary is controlled by the bank and is, therefore, an affiliate.
Aggregate Lending: The number of loans originated and purchased by all reporting lenders in specified income
categories as a percentage of the aggregate number of loans originated and purchased by all reporting lenders in
the MA/assessment area.
Block Numbering Area (BNA): A statistical subdivision of a county for grouping and numbering blocks in non-
metropolitan counties where local census statistical area committees have not established census tracts.  A BNA
does not cross county lines.
Census Tract (CT): A small subdivision of metropolitan and other densely populated counties.  Census tract
boundaries do not cross county lines; however, they may cross the boundaries of metropolitan statistical areas.
Census tracts usually have between 2,500 and 8,000 persons, and their physical size varies widely depending
upon population density.  Census tracts are designed to be homogeneous with respect to population
characteristics, economic status, and living conditions to allow for statistical comparisons.
Community Development: Affordable housing (including multifamily rental housing) for low- or moderate-
income individuals; community services targeted to low- or moderate-income individuals; activities that promote
economic development by financing businesses or farms that meet the size eligibility standards of the Small
Business Administration’s Development Company or Small Business Investment Company programs
(13 CFR 121.301) or have gross annual revenues of $1 million or less; or, activities that revitalize or stabilize
low- or moderate-income geographies.
Consumer Loan(s): A loan(s) to one or more individuals for household, family, or other personal expenditures.
A consumer loan does not include a home mortgage, small business, or small farm loan. This definition includes
the following categories: motor vehicle loans, credit card loans, home equity loans, other secured consumer loans,
and other unsecured consumer loans.
Community Reinvestment Act (CRA): the statute that requires the OCC to evaluate a bank’s record of meeting
the credit needs of its local community, consistent with the safe and sound operation of the bank, and to take this
record into account when evaluating certain corporate applications filed by the bank.
Family: Includes a householder and one or more other persons living in the same household who are related to
the householder by birth, marriage, or adoption.  The number of family households always equals the number of
families; however, a family household may also include non-relatives living with the family.  Families are
classified by type as either a married-couple family or other family, which is further classified into ‘male
householder’ (a family with a male household and no wife present) or ‘female householder’ (a family with a
female householder and no husband present).
Full Review: Performance under the Lending, Investment, and Service Tests is analyzed considering performance
context, quantitative factors (e.g., geographic distribution, borrower distribution, and total number and dollar
amount of investments), and qualitative factors (e.g., innovativeness, complexity, and responsiveness).
22
Geography: A census tract or a block numbering area delineated by the United States Bureau of the Census in the
most recent decennial census.
Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA): The statute that requires certain mortgage lenders that do business or
have banking offices in a metropolitan statistical area to file annual summary reports of their mortgage lending
activity.  The reports include such data as the race, gender, and the income of applications, the amount of loan
requested, and the disposition of the application (e.g., approved, denied, and withdrawn).
Home Mortgage Loans: such loans include home purchase and home improvement loans, as defined in the
HMDA regulation.  This definition also includes loans for multifamily (five or more families) dwellings, loans for
the purchase of manufactured homes and refinancing of home improvement and home purchase loans.
Household: Includes all persons occupying a housing unit.  Persons not living in households are classified as
living in group quarters.  In 100 percent tabulations, the count of households always equals the count of occupied
housing units.
Limited Review: Performance under the Lending, Investment, and Service Tests is analyzed using only
quantitative factors (e.g., geographic distribution, borrower distribution, total number and dollar amount of
investments, and branch distribution).
Low-Income: Individual income that is less than 50 percent of the area median income, or a median family
income that is less than 50 percent, in the case of a geography.
Market Share: The number of loans originated and purchased by the institution as a percentage of the aggregate
number of loans originated and purchased by all reporting lenders in the MA/assessment area.
Median Family Income (MFI): The median income determined by the U.S. Census Bureau every ten years and
used to determine the income level category of geographies.  Also, the median income determined by the
Department of Housing and Urban Development annually that is used to determine the income level category of
individuals.  For any given area, the median is the point at which half of the families have income above it and
half below it.
Metropolitan Area (MA): Any primary metropolitan statistical area (PMSA), metropolitan statistical area
(MSA), or consolidated metropolitan area (CMSA), as defined by the Office of Management and Budget, with a
population of 250,000 or more, and any other area designated as such by the appropriate federal financial
supervisory agency.
Middle-Income:  Individual income that is at least 80 percent and less than 120 percent of the area median
income, or a median family income that is at least 80 percent and less than 120 percent, in the case of a
geography.
Moderate-Income:  Individual income that is at least 50 percent and less than 80 percent of the area median
income, or a median family income that is at least 50 percent and less than 80 percent, in the case of a geography.
Multifamily:  Refers to a residential structure that contains five or more units.
Other Products: Includes any unreported optional category of loans for which the institution collects and
maintains data for consideration during a CRA examination.  Examples of such activity include consumer loans
and other loan data an institution may provide concerning its lending performance.
Owner-Occupied Units: Includes units occupied by the owner or co-owner, even if the unit has not been fully
paid for or is mortgaged.
33
Qualified Investment: A qualified investment is defined as any lawful investment, deposit, membership share, or
grant that has as its primary purpose community development.
Rated Area: A rated area is a state or multi-state metropolitan area.  For an institution with domestic branches in
only one state, the institution’s CRA rating would be the state rating.  If an institution maintains domestic
branches in more than one state, the institution will receive a rating for each state in which those branches are
located.  If an institution maintains domestic branches in two or more states within a multi-state metropolitan area,
the institution will receive a rating for the multi-state metropolitan area.
Small Loan(s) to Business(es): A loan included in 'loans to small businesses' as defined in the Consolidated
Report of Condition and Income (Call Report) and the Thrift Financial Reporting (TFR) instructions.  These loans
have original amounts of $1 million or less and typically are either secured by nonfarm or nonresidential real
estate or are classified as commercial and industrial loans.  However, thrift institutions may also exercise the
option to report loans secured by nonfarm residential real estate as "small business loans" if the loans are reported
on the TFR as nonmortgage, commercial loans.
Small Loan(s) to Farm(s): A loan included in ‘loans to small farms’ as defined in the instructions for preparation
of the Consolidated Report of Condition and Income (Call Report).  These loans have original amounts of
$500,000 or less and are either secured by farmland, or are classified as loans to finance agricultural production
and other loans to farmers.
Tier One Capital: The total of common shareholders’ equity, perpetual preferred shareholders’ equity with non-
cumulative dividends, retained earnings and minority interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries.
Upper-Income:  Individual income that is more than 120 percent of the area median income, or a median family
income that is more than 120 percent, in the case of a geography.

Description of Institution
Bremer Bank, National Association (Bremer) is a $426 million intrastate commercial bank
headquartered in Minot, North Dakota.  In addition to the main office in Minot, the bank has fourteen
branches located in the communities of Berthold, Carrington, Devils Lake, Glenfield, Kensal, Lansford,
Max, Minnewaukan, Richardton, Rugby, and Woodworth.  The bank also maintains four ATMs in
Minot, three in Devils Lake, and one in Rugby.
The bank is owned by Bremer Financial Corporation (BFC), a $5 billion holding company
headquartered in St. Paul, Minnesota.  BFC has 11 national bank subsidiaries (with more than 100
banking locations) throughout Minnesota, North Dakota, and Wisconsin.  Non-bank affiliates include
trust, insurance, management, and operations service companies.  BFC is owned by Otto Bremer
Foundation, a charitable trust.  As a charitable trust, the Foundation must disperse at least 5% of its
assets for charitable causes annually.
Bremer is a full-service bank offering a variety of loan and deposit products.  Its lending focus is
agricultural and commercial loans.  As of December 31, 2000, net loans totaled $240 million and
represented 57% of total assets and 68% of total deposits.  Tier 1 capital totaled $30 million.  The loan
portfolio consists of the following: commercial (46%); agricultural (31%); residential real estate (12%);
consumer (7%); and other loans (4%).
There are no financial, legal, or other factors that impede the bank’s ability to help meet the credit needs
in its assessment area.  Bremer received a Satisfactory rating at its last CRA evaluation dated
September 21, 1998.

Scope of the Evaluation
Evaluation Period/Products Evaluated
• The evaluation period for the lending test (excluding community development loans) is
January 1, 1998 through December 31, 2000.  Home mortgage lending activity does not include
1998 data because many individual loan records were no longer available for validation.
• The evaluation period for community development loans, the investment test, and the service test is
September 22, 1998 through December 31, 2000.
• The bank collects home purchase and refinance loan data even though it is not a HMDA reporter.
Bank systems do not separately code home improvement loans.
• We did not evaluate home mortgage loans in the lending test analysis.  Residential loans are not a
primary bank product.  Home mortgages loans accounted for only 6% of loans over the evaluation
period by number (and 9% by dollar volume).
• Products reviewed in the lending test include small business loans, small farm loans, and community
development loans.
• In the Lending Test, we gave the most weight to farm loans followed by business loans.  Farm
lending represents 71% of the bank’s loans by number (and 55% by dollar volume) over the
evaluation period.  Business lending represents 23% of bank loans by number (and 36% by dollar
volume).
• Market comparisons for business and farm lending are based on 2000 peer data.  This was the most
recent data available at the time of the evaluation.
• At the bank’s request, we considered qualified investments made by the affiliated Otto Bremer
Foundation.
• At the bank’s request, we also considered automated teller machines (ATMs) owned by the affiliated
Bremer Services, Incorporated in the “Service Test” assessment.
66
Data Integrity
• To assess the accuracy of the bank’s CRA data, we compared reported information to credit file
documentation for an independent sample of loans.  We did not identify any material errors.
• To assess the accuracy of the bank’s HMDA data, we compared reported information to credit file
documentation for an independent sample of loans.  We identified a material reporting error
involving the inclusion of home equity loans that do not have a HMDA purpose.  The bank revised
the data during the examination, and we validated its accuracy via another independent sample.  The
revised data is presented in this evaluation.
• We reviewed 100% of the bank’s community development loans, investments, and services.  Only
those activities that qualified are presented and considered in this evaluation.
Selection of Areas for Full-Scope Review
We performed a full scope review of the bank’s sole assessment area.
Ratings
The bank’s overall rating is based entirely on performance in its sole assessment area.
Other Information
Refer to Appendix B for performance context information and a description of the community contacts
used in this evaluation.
Fair Lending Review
We performed an analysis of 1999 and 2000 public comments, consumer complaint information,
small business and small farm lending data according to the OCC’s risk based fair lending approach.
Based on this analysis, we concluded that a comprehensive fair lending examination was not needed in
connection with the CRA evaluation this year.  The bank’s last comprehensive fair lending examination
was performed in 1998.

Conclusions with Respect to Performance Tests
LENDING TEST
Conclusion
Bremer’s performance under the Lending Test is rated “Outstanding”.  Overall lending activity is
excellent, the borrower distribution of loans is excellent, and the geographic distribution of loans is
good.  The bank also had a high level of community development lending which received positive
consideration in our assessment of lending performance.
Lending Activity
(Refer to Table 1 in Appendix C for the facts and data used to evaluate the bank’s lending activity.)
Lending levels reflect excellent responsiveness in relation to area credit needs and the bank’s deposit
market share.  Agricultural loans are essential to the vitality of the local economy.  Community contacts
also identified business loans as an area credit need.  Bremer has the most deposits ($326 million)
among 39 financial institutions with an office in the Minot assessment area.  The bank’s deposit rank
is 1 and its market share is 13%.
Farm lending activity is excellent.  Bremer reported 3,864 farm loans totaling $167 million over the
evaluation period.  Bremer originated 58% of all reported 2000 farm loans in the Minot assessment area,
ranking first among 11 lenders.  The meaningfulness of market share information is, however, somewhat
limited.  Only four of 38 local competitors reported large bank CRA data for the year 2000.  These CRA
data reporters collectively account for 38% of area deposits.  Among CRA data reporters only, Bremer’s
farm loan market share is 59% and its deposit market share is 33%.
Business lending activity is good.  Bremer reported 1,248 business loans totaling $110 million over the
evaluation period.  Bremer originated 19% of all reported 2000 business loans in the Minot assessment
area, ranking first of 36 lenders.  As previously mentioned, the meaningfulness of market share data is
somewhat limited.  Among CRA data reporters only, Bremer’s business loan market share is 36% and
its deposit market share is 33%.
In our assessment of lending activity, we also considered the favorable comments received from
community contacts and the lack of CRA complaints in the bank’s public CRA file.
88
Distribution of Loans by Income Level of the Geography
The bank’s overall geographic distribution of loans is good.
Small Loans to Farms
(Refer to Table 6 in Appendix C for the facts and data used to evaluate the geographic distribution of
the bank’s origination and purchase of small loans to farms.)
The geographic distribution of farm loans is good.  The bank’s percentage of loans in moderate-income
geographies is near the percentage of farms located in those geographies.  There are no low-income
geographies in the Minot assessment area.
Of all banks that reported 2000 CRA data, Bremer originated the most farm loans in moderate-income
geographies (and the most farm loans) in the Minot assessment area.  The bank’s market share for farm
loans in moderate-income areas (51%) is near its overall farm loan market share (58%).  No other
reporting bank had a market share for farm loans in moderate-income geographies of more than 28%.
Small Loans to Businesses
(Refer to Table 5 in Appendix C for the facts and data used to evaluate the geographic distribution of
the bank’s origination and purchase of small loans to businesses.)
The geographic distribution of business loans is excellent.  The bank’s percentage of loans in moderate-
income geographies significantly exceeds the percentage of businesses located in those geographies.
Of all banks that reported 2000 CRA data, Bremer originated the most business loans in moderate-
income geographies (and the most business loans) in the Minot assessment area.  The bank’s market
share for business loans in moderate-income areas exceeds its overall business loan market share.  No
other reporting bank had a market share for business loans in moderate-income geographies of more
than 10%.
Home Mortgage Loans
(Refer to Tables 2, 3 and 4 in Appendix C for the facts and data used to evaluate the geographic
distribution of the bank’s home mortgage loan originations and purchases.)
Residential loans are not a primary bank product and were not analyzed.
Lending Gap Analysis
Our geographic distribution analysis included a review for any unexplained lending gaps in the
Minot AA, particularly in moderate-income geographies.  We did not identify any conspicuous gaps.
Inside/Outside Ratio
A substantial majority of the bank’s loans (89% by number) are inside the Minot assessment area.
By product type, 88% of farm loans and 94% of business loans are inside the bank’s assessment area.
We viewed this characteristic positively in our assessment of lending performance.
99
Distribution of Loans by Income Level of the Borrower
The bank’s overall borrower distribution of loans is excellent.
Small Loans to Farms
(Refer to Table 10 in Appendix C for the facts and data used to evaluate the borrower distribution of the
bank’s origination and purchase of small loans to farms.)
The distribution of loans to farms of difference sizes is excellent.  The percentage of loans to small
farms (i.e. gross annual revenues of $1 million or less) exceeds the percentage of small farms in the
assessment area.
Of all banks that reported 2000 CRA data, Bremer originated the most loans to small farms (and the
most farm loans) in the Minot assessment area.  In addition, the bank’s market share for loans to small
farms exceeds its overall farm loan market share.
The bank’s willingness to make loans to small farms is further evidenced by its loan size distribution.
Approximately 90% of Bremer’s reported farm loans were originated in amounts of $100,000 or less.
Small Loans to Businesses
(Refer to Table 9 in Appendix C for the facts and data used to evaluate the borrower distribution of the
bank’s origination and purchase of small loans to businesses.)
The distribution of loans to businesses of difference sizes is good.  The percentage of loans to small
businesses (i.e. gross annual revenues of $1 million or less) substantially meets the percentage of small
businesses in the assessment area.
Of all banks that reported 2000 CRA data, Bremer originated the most loans to small businesses (and the
most business loans) in the Minot in assessment area.  In addition, the bank’s market share for loans to
small businesses exceeds its overall business loan market share.
The bank’s willingness to make loans to small businesses is further evidenced by its loan size
distribution.  Approximately 78% of Bremer’s reported business loans originated in amounts of
$100,000 or less.
Home Mortgage Loans
(Refer to Tables 7, and 8 in Appendix C for the facts and data used to evaluate the borrower distribution
of the bank’s home mortgage loan originations and purchases.)
Residential loans are not a primary bank product and were not analyzed.
10
10
Community Development Lending
(Refer to Table 1 in Appendix C for the facts and data used to evaluate the bank’s level of community
development lending.)
Bremer originated three community development loans totaling $6.4 million.  Community development
loans accounted for 2% of the lending activity considered in this evaluation period (by dollar volume).
Community development loans represented 21% of the bank’s Tier 1 capital.  The community
development loans were responsive to assessment area needs in that they promoted economic
development and provided social services to low- and moderate-income individuals.
This volume of community development lending activity is considered excellent.  We did not identify
any other banks with this level of community development lending in the Minot assessment area.  The
bank’s level of community development lending had a positive impact on its Lending Test assessment.
11
11
INVESTMENT TEST
(Refer to Table 12 in Appendix C for the facts and data used to evaluate the bank’s level of qualified
investments.)
Bank performance under the Investment Test is rated “High Satisfactory”.
Bremer provided a good level of qualified investments in the Minot assessment area.  Qualified
investments consist primarily of current period contributions to organizations that provide community
development services.
The bank provided 46 qualified grants and donations totaling $598 thousand during the evaluation
period.  Seventy-seven percent of the donations (by dollar) funded organizations that provide social
services to low- and moderate-income (LMI) individuals.  Another 15% of the donations benefited
organizations that facilitate small business development.  The remaining 8% benefited organizations that
provide affordable housing for LMI individuals.
Bremer also has two outstanding prior period investments (totaling $200 thousand) in the North Dakota
Small Business Investment Company.  The North Dakota Small Business Investment Company is a
limited partnership that makes venture capital investments in manufacturing, service, and retail
businesses with the potential for substantial growth and long term equity appreciation.  The company
serves the entire state of North Dakota.
The bank’s volume of qualified investments is considered good given the somewhat limited investment
opportunities in the assessment area.  We did not identify any other opportunities for community
development investment securities in our performance context research, community contact work, or our
review of the CRA performance evaluations of competing banks.  CRA investment opportunities
primarily consist of contributions to organizations with a community development purpose.
12
12
SERVICE TEST
Bank performance under the Service Test is rated “High Satisfactory”.
Retail Banking Services
(Refer to Table 13 in Appendix C for the facts and data used to evaluate the distribution of the bank’s
branch delivery system and branch openings and closings.)
Bremer’s delivery systems are accessible to geographies and individuals of different income levels
throughout the assessment area.  The percentage of branches operated in moderate-income geographies
exceeds that of the population.  The distribution of ATMs in moderate-income tracts also exceeds the
demographic.  Twenty percent of the bank’s ATMs accept deposits.
Business hours offered throughout the assessment area are reasonable and do not vary in a way that
inconveniences low- or moderate-income geographies or individuals.  Bremer offers its complete line of
products and services at each office in the assessment area; six locations have in-house lenders.  The
Devils Lake office (located in a moderate-income area) is one location with an in-house lender.  Other
branches accept loan application and forward them to the Minot or Devils Lake offices.
Alternative delivery systems include a 24-hour telephone service and an Internet banking service.  The
telephone banking service allows customers to check balances, review account history, transfer funds,
initiate stop payment orders, and check CD and loan rates.  The Internet banking service offers similar
features in addition to accepting loan payments and processing bill payment requests.
Alternate delivery systems did not influence service test performance, as the bank could not demonstrate
the impact of these systems in low- and moderate-income geographies or the use of these systems by
low- and moderate-income individuals.
No branches were opened or closed during this evaluation period.
Community Development Services
Bremer provides an adequate level of community development services.  During the evaluation period,
the bank provided qualifying services to 13 organizations.  Services primarily consist of providing
technical expertise and serving on the Board of Directors for organizations that address affordable
housing needs and small business development.

(*) The NA category consists of geographies that have not been assigned an income classification.
Source: 1990 US Census, 2001 HUD updated MFI, and the State of North Dakota Labor Force.
The bank has one, non-metropolitan assessment area (AA).  The AA consists of 12 whole
counties (Benson, Bottineau, Dunn, Eddy, Foster, McHenry, McLean, Pierce, Ramsey, Stark,
Stutsman, and Ward).  The AA resembles an upside down “U” covering the north central part of
the state.  Although the AA is primarily comprised of middle- and upper-income geographies, it
does contain seven moderate-income areas.  The moderate-income geographies are spread
throughout the AA.  The AA does not contain any low-income geographies.  The AA complies
with regulatory guidelines and does not arbitrarily exclude LMI areas.
The economy is stable and has a mixture of agriculture, manufacturing, and service industries.
The economy is heavily dependent on agriculture as many of the businesses are directly related to
agriculture.  Major agricultural products include wheat, barley, sunflowers, and beef cattle.
Unemployment is well below the national average.
We performed a community contact with an economic development organization.  We also
reviewed five recent contacts by other regulators with tribal government, local government, and
economic development representatives.  Contacts cited a credit need for business start up and
expansion loans.  They indicated that area banks are very active in the community and are
generally meeting area credit needs.  Some contacts indicated a need for housing stock in some
communities, while other communities had ample housing.
Community development opportunities in the assessment area are somewhat limited.  We did not
identify any significant opportunities for community development loans, investments or services
in our performance context research, community contact work, or our review of the CRA
performance evaluations of competing banks.  As evidenced by the bank’s performance,
community development opportunities primarily consist of loans, contributions, and service work
with nonprofit organizations that have a community development purpose.
Appendix B-1
Numerous commercial banks provide strong competition for bank services in the AA.  Bremer
has the largest deposit market share in the AA (13%) as of June 30, 2001.  Institutions with the
next highest market shares are significantly larger institutions that serve much larger geographic
areas - Wells Fargo Bank North Dakota, N.A. (12%) and U.S. Bank N.A. (8%).  Other
competitors have less than an 8% deposit market share each and primarily consist of small,
independent community banks.

number of loans originated and purchased by the bank as a percentage of the aggregate number of
reportable loans originated and purchased by all lenders in the MSA/assessment area.
The following is a listing and brief description of the tables:
Table 1.
Lending Volume - Presents the number and dollar amount of reportable loans originated
and purchased by the bank over the evaluation period by MSA/assessment area.
Table 2.
Geographic Distribution of Home Purchase Loans - Compares the percentage
distribution of the number of loans originated and purchased by the bank in low-,
moderate-, middle-, and upper-income geographies to the percentage distribution of owner-
occupied housing units throughout those geographies.  The table also presents market share
information based on the most recent aggregate market data available.
Table 3.
Geographic Distribution of Home Improvement Loans (not applicable)
Table 4.
Geographic Distribution of Home Mortgage Refinance Loans - See Table 2.
Table 5.
Geographic Distribution of Multifamily Loans - See Table 2.
Table 6.
Geographic Distribution of Small Loans to Businesses - The percentage distribution of
the number of small loans (less than or equal to $1 million) to businesses originated and
purchased by the bank in low-, moderate-, middle-, and upper-income geographies
compared to the percentage distribution of businesses (regardless of revenue size)
throughout those geographies.  The table also presents market share information based on
the most recent aggregate market data available.
Table 7.
Geographic Distribution of Small Loans to Farms - The percentage distribution of the
number of small loans (less than or equal to $500,000) to farms originated and purchased
by the bank in low-, moderate-, middle-, and upper-income geographies compared to the
percentage distribution of farms (regardless of revenue size) throughout those geographies.
The table also presents market share information based on the most recent aggregate
market data available.
Table 8.
Borrower Distribution of Home Purchase Loans - Compares the percentage distribution
of the number of loans originated and purchased by the bank to low-, moderate-, middle-,
and upper-income borrowers to the percentage distribution of families by income level in
each MSA/assessment area.  The table also presents market share information based on the
most recent aggregate market data available.

Table 11.
Borrower Distribution of Small Loans to Businesses - Compares the percentage
distribution of the number of small loans (less than or equal to $1 million) originated and
purchased by the bank to businesses with revenues of $1 million or less to the percentage
distribution of businesses with revenues of $1 million or less.  In addition, the table
presents the percentage distribution of the number of loans originated and purchased by the
bank by loan size, regardless of the revenue size of the business.  Market share information
is presented based on the most recent aggregate market data available.
Table 12.
Borrower Distribution of Small Loans to Farms - Compares the percentage distribution
of the number of small loans (less than or equal to $500,000) originated and purchased by
the bank to farms with revenues of $1 million or less to the percentage distribution of farms
with revenues of $1 million or less. In addition, the table presents the percentage
distribution of the number of loans originated and purchased by the bank by loan size,
regardless of the revenue size of the farm.  Market share information is presented based on
the most recent aggregate market data available.
Table 13.
Qualified Investments - Presents the number and dollar amount of qualified investments
made by the bank in each MSA/AA.  The table separately presents investments made
during prior evaluation periods that are still outstanding and investments made during the
current evaluation period.  Prior-period investments are reflected at their book value as of
the end of the evaluation period.  Current period investments are reflected at their original
investment amount even if that amount is greater than the current book value of the
investment.  The table also presents the number and dollar amount of unfunded qualified
investment commitments.  In order to be included, an unfunded commitment must be
legally binding and tracked and recorded by the bank’s financial reporting system.
Table 14.
Distribution of Branch and ATM Delivery System - Compares the percentage
distribution of the number of the bank’s branches and ATMs in low-, moderate-, middle-,
and upper-income geographies to the percentage of the population within each geography
in each MSA/AA.
