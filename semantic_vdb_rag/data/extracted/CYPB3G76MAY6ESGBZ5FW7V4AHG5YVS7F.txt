taxable year for inclusion of income
and deduction of expenses under an ac-
crual method of accounting, see sec-
tions 451 and 461 and the regulations
thereunder.
(2) Section 818(a)(2) provides that, to
the extent permitted under this sec-
tion, a life insurance company’s meth-
od of accounting may be a combination
of the accrual method with any other
method of accounting permitted by
chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1954, other than the cash receipts
and disbursements method. Thus, sec-
tion 818(a)(2) specifically prohibits the
use by a life insurance company of the
cash receipts and disbursements meth-
od either separately or in combination
with a permissible method of account-
ing. The term ‘‘method of accounting’’
includes not only the over-all method
of accounting of the taxpayer but also
the accounting treatment of any item.
For purposes of section 818(a)(2), a life
insurance company may elect to com-
pute its taxable income under an over-
all method of accounting consisting of
the accrual method combined with the
special methods of accounting for par-
ticular items of income and expense
provided under other sections of chap-
ter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of
1954, other than the cash receipts and
disbursements method. These methods
of accounting for special items include
the accounting treatment provided for
depreciation (section 167), research and
experimental 
expenditures 
(section
174), soil and water conservation ex-
penditures (section 175), organizational
expenditures (section 248), etc. In addi-
tion, a life insurance company may,
where applicable, use the crop method
of accounting (as provided in the regu-
lations under sections 61 and 162), and
the installment method of accounting
for sales of realty and casual sales of
personalty (as provided in section
453(b)). To the extent not inconsistent
with the provisions of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1954 or the regulations
thereunder and the method of account-
ing adopted by the taxpayer pursuant
to this section, all computations enter-
ing into the determination of taxes im-
posed by part I shall be made in a man-
ner consistent with the manner re-
quired for purposes of the annual state-
ment approved by the National Asso-
ciation of Insurance Commissioners.
(3)(i) An election to use any of the
special methods of accounting referred
to in subparagraph (2) of this para-
graph which was made pursuant to any
provisions of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1954 or prior revenue laws for
purposes of determining a company’s
tax liabilities for prior years, shall
have the same force and effect in deter-
mining the items of gross investment
income under section 804(b) and the
items of deduction under section 804(c)
of the Life Insurance Company Income
Tax Act of 1959 (73 Stat. 112) as if such
Act had not been enacted.
(ii) For purposes of determining gain
or loss from operations under section
809(b), in computing the life insurance
company’s share of investment yield
under section 809(b) (1)(A) and (2)(A),
an election with respect to any of the
special methods of accounting referred
to in subparagraph (2) of this para-
graph which was made pursuant to any
provision of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1954 or prior revenue laws, shall not
be affected in any way by the enact-
ment of the Life Insurance Company
Income Tax Act of 1959 (73 Stat. 112).
(iii) For purposes of determining gain
or loss from operations under section
809(b), in computing the items of gross
amount under section 809(c) and the de-
duction items under section 809(d), an
election to use any of the special meth-
ods of accounting referred to in sub-
paragraph (2) of this paragraph must be
made in accordance with the specific
statutory provisions of the sections
containing such elections and the regu-
lations thereunder. However, where a
particular election may be made only
with the consent of the Commissioner
(either because the time for making
the election without the consent of the
Commissioner has expired or because
the particular section contained no
provision for making an election with-
out consent), and the time prescribed
by the applicable regulations for sub-
mitting a request for permission to
make such an election for the taxable
year 1958 has expired, a life insurance
company may make such an election
for the year 1958 at the time of filing
its return for that year (including ex-
tensions thereof). For example, a life

insurance company may elect any of
the methods of depreciation prescribed
in section 167 (to the extent permitted
under that section and the regulations
thereunder) with respect to those as-
sets, or any portion thereof, for which
no depreciation was allowable under
prior revenue laws, for example, fur-
niture and fixtures used in the under-
writing department. Similarly, a life
insurance company shall be permitted
to make an election under section
461(c) (relating to the accrual of real
property taxes) with respect to real
property for which no deduction was
allowable under prior revenue laws.
Any such election shall be made in the
manner and form prescribed in the ap-
plicable regulations.
(iv) For purposes of subdivision (ii) of
this subparagraph, the method used
under section 1016(a)(3)(C) (relating to
adjustments to basis) in determining
the amount of exhaustion, wear and
tear, obsolescence, and amortization
actually sustained shall not preclude a
taxpayer from electing any of the
methods prescribed in section 167 in ac-
cordance with the provisions of that
section and the regulations thereunder
for determining the amount of such ex-
haustion, wear and tear, obsolescence,
and amortization for the year 1958. For
example, if the amount of depreciation
actually 
sustained, 
under 
section
1016(a)(3)(C), on a life insurance com-
pany’s home office building (other than
that portion for which depreciation
was allowable under prior revenue
laws) is determined on the straight line
method, the life insurance company
may elect for the year 1958 to use any
of the methods prescribed in section 167
for determining its depreciation allow-
ance for 1958. However, such election
shall be binding for 1958, and for all
subsequent taxable years, unless con-
sent to change such election, if re-
quired, is obtained from the Commis-
sioner in accordance with the provi-
sions of section 167 and the regulations
thereunder.
(4)(i) 
For 
purposes 
of 
section
805(b)(3)(B)(i) (relating to the deter-
mination of the current earnings rate
for any taxable year beginning before
January 1, 1958), the determination for
any year of the investment yield and
the assets shall be made as though the
taxpayer had been on the accrual
method prescribed in subparagraph (1)
of this paragraph for such year, or the
accrual method in combination with
the other methods of accounting pre-
scribed in subparagraph (2) of this
paragraph, if these other methods of
accounting are used by the taxpayer in
determining the investment yield and
assets for the taxable year 1958. How-
ever, where the method used for deter-
mining the deduction under section 167
for the year 1958 differs from the meth-
od used in prior years, the amount of
the deduction actually allowed or al-
lowable for such prior years for pur-
poses of section 1016(a)(2) (relating to
adjustments to basis) shall be the
amount to be taken into account in de-
termining the current earnings rate
under section 805(b)(3)(B)(i).
(ii) 
For 
purposes 
of 
section
812(b)(1)(C) (relating to operations loss
carrybacks and carryovers for years
prior to 1958), the determination for
those years of the gain or loss from op-
erations shall be made as though the
taxpayer had been on the accrual
method of accounting prescribed in
subparagraph (1) of this paragraph for
such year, or the accrual method in
combination with the other methods of
accounting prescribed in subparagraph
(2) of this paragraph, if these other
methods of accounting are used by the
taxpayer in the determination of gain
or loss from operations for the taxable
year 1958. However, where any adjust-
ment to basis is required under section
1016(a)(3)(C) on account of exhaustion,
wear and tear, obsolescence, amortiza-
tion, 
and 
depletion 
sustained, 
the
amount actually sustained as deter-
mined under section 1016(a)(3)(C) for
each of the years involved shall be the
amount allowed in the determination
of gain or loss from operations for pur-
poses of section 812(b)(1)(C).
(b) Adjustments required if accrual
method of accounting was not used in
1957. The items of gross amount taken
into account under section 809(c) and
the items of deductions allowed under
section 809(d) for the taxable year 1958
shall be determined as though the tax-
payer had been on the accrual method
of accounting prescribed in paragraph
(a) of this section for all prior years.

§ 1.818–2
mining any item referred to in section
810(c) as of the close of any taxable
year differs from the basis for such de-
termination as of the close of the pre-
ceding taxable year. Under an accrual
method of accounting, a change in the
basis or method of computing the
amount of liability of any item re-
ferred to in section 810(c) occurs in the
taxable year in which all the events
have occurred which determine the
change in the basis or method of com-
puting the amount of such liability
and, in which, the amount thereof
(whether increased or decreased) can be
determined with reasonable accuracy.
(2) The application of subparagraph
(1) of this paragraph may be illustrated
by the following examples:
Example 1. Assume that during the taxable
year 1960, M, a life insurance company, de-
termines that the amount of its life insur-
ance reserves held with respect to a par-
ticular block of contracts is understated on
the present basis being used in valuing such
liability and that such liability can be more
accurately reflected by changing from the
present basis to a particular new basis. As-
sume that M uses such new basis in com-
puting its reserves under such contracts at
the end of the taxable year 1960. Under the
provisions of section 818(a) and subparagraph
(1) of this paragraph, the change in basis for
purposes of sections 806(b) and 810(d) occurs
during the taxable year 1960, the year in
which all the events have occurred which de-
termine the change in basis and the amount
of any increase (or decrease) attributable to
such change can be determined with reason-
able accuracy. Such change shall be treated
as having occurred during the taxable year
1960 whether M determines that its liability
under such contracts was understated for the
first time during 1960, or that its liability
under such contracts has, in fact, been un-
derstated for a number of prior years.
Example 2. Assume the facts are the same
as in example 1, except that during the tax-
able year 1960 the insurance department of
State X issues a ruling, pursuant to author-
ity conferred by statute, requiring M to use
the particular new basis which more accu-
rately reflects its liability with respect to
such contracts and that as a result of such
ruling, M uses the new basis in computing its
reserves under such contracts for the taxable
years 1958, 1959, and 1960. Under the provi-
sions of section 818(a) and subparagraph (1)
of this paragraph, the change in basis for
purposes of sections 806(b) and 810(d) occurs
during the taxable year 1960, the year in
which all the events have occurred which de-
termine that a change in basis should be
the accrual method for the year 1957
shall accrue, as of December 31, 1957,
those items of gross amount which
would have been properly taken into
account for the year 1957 if the com-
pany had been on the accrual method
described in section 818(a). Likewise,
life insurance companies not on the ac-
crual method for the year 1957 shall ac-
crue, as of December 31, 1957, those
items of deductions which would have
been properly allowed for the year 1957
if the company had been on the accrual
method described in section 818(a). For
example, if certain premium amounts
were received during the year 1958 but
such amounts would have been prop-
erly taken into account for the year
1957 if the taxpayer had been on the ac-
crual method for the year 1957, then
the taxpayer will not be required to
take such premium amounts into ac-
count for the year 1958. If, for example,
certain claims, benefits, and losses
were paid during the year 1958 but such
items would have been properly taken
into account for the year 1957 if the
taxpayer had been on the accrual
method for the year 1957, then the tax-
payer will not be permitted to deduct
such expense items for the year 1958.
For a special transitional rule applica-
ble with respect to changes in method
of accounting required by section 818(a)
and paragraph (a) of this section, see
section 818(e) and § 1.818–6.
(c) Change of basis in computing re-
serves. (1) Section 806(b) provides that if
the basis for determining the amount
of any item referred to in section 810(c)
as of the close of the taxable year dif-
fers from the basis for such determina-
tion as of the beginning of the taxable
year, then for purposes of subpart B,
part I, subchapter L, chapter 1 of the
Code (relating to the determination of
taxable 
investment 
income), 
the
amount of such item shall be the
amount computed on the old basis as of
the close of the taxable year and the
amount computed on the new basis as
of the beginning of the next taxable
year. Similarly, section 810(d)(1) pro-
vides rules for determining the amount
of the adjustment to be made for pur-
poses of subpart C, part I, subchapter
L, chapter 1 of the Code (relating to
the determination of gain or loss from
operations), if the basis for deter-

§ 1.818–3
Amortization of premium and
accrual of discount.
(a) In general. Section 818(b) provides
that the appropriate items of income,
deductions, 
and 
adjustments 
under
part I, subchapter L, chapter 1 of the
Code, shall be adjusted to reflect the
appropriate amortization of premium
and the appropriate accrual of discount
on bonds, notes, debentures, or other
evidences of indebtedness held by a life
insurance company. Such adjustments
are limited to the amount of appro-
priate amortization or accrual attrib-
utable to the taxable year with respect
to such securities which are not in de-
fault as to principal or interest and
which are amply secured. The question
of ample security will be resolved ac-
cording to the rules laid down from
time to time by the National Associa-
tion of Insurance Commissioners. The
adjustment for amortization of pre-
mium decreases the gross investment
income, the exclusion and reduction for
wholly tax-exempt interest, the exclu-
sion and deduction for partially tax-ex-
empt interest, and the basis or ad-
justed basis of such securities. The ad-
justment for accrual of discount in-
creases the gross investment income,
the exclusion and reduction for wholly
tax-exempt interest, the exclusion and
deduction for partially tax-exempt in-
terest, and the basis or adjusted basis
of such securities. However, for taxable
years beginning after May 31, 1960, only
the accrual of discount relating to
issue discount will increase the exclu-
sion and reduction for wholly tax-ex-
empt interest. See section 103.
(b) Acquisitions before January 1, 1958.
(1) In the case of any such security ac-
quired before January 1, 1958, the pre-
mium is the excess of its acquisition
value over its maturity value and the
discount is the excess of its maturity
value over its acquisition value. The
acquisition value of any such security
is its cost (including buying commis-
sions or brokerage but excluding any
amounts paid for accrued interest) if
purchased for cash, or if not purchased
for cash, its then fair market value.
The maturity value of any such secu-
rity is the amount payable thereunder
either at the maturity date or an ear-
lier call date. The earlier call date of
any such security may be the earliest
interest payment date if it is callable
or payable at such date, the earliest
date at which it is callable at par, or
such other call or payment date, prior
to maturity, specified in the security
as may be selected by the life insur-
ance company. A life insurance com-
pany which adjusts amortization of
premium or accrual of discount with
reference to a particular call or pay-
ment date must make the adjustments
with reference to the value on such
date and may not, after selecting such
date, use a different call or payment
date, or value, in the calculation of
such amortization or discount with re-
spect to such security unless the secu-
rity was not in fact called or paid on
such selected date.
(2) The adjustments for amortization
of premium and accrual of discount
will be determined:
(i) According to the method regularly
employed by the company, if such
method is reasonable, or
(ii) According to the method pre-
scribed by this section.
A method of amortization of premium
or accrual of discount will be deemed
‘‘regularly employed’’ by a life insur-
ance company if the method was con-
sistently followed in prior taxable
years, or if, in the case of a company
which has never before made such ad-
justments, the company initiates in
the first taxable year for which the ad-
justments are made a reasonable meth-
od of amortization of premium or ac-
crual of discount and consistently fol-
lows such method thereafter. Ordi-
narily, a company regularly employs a
method in accordance with the statute
of some State, Territory, or the Dis-
trict of Columbia, in which it operates.
(3) The method of amortization and
accrual prescribed by this section is as
follows:
(i) The premium (or discount) shall
be determined in accordance with this
section; and
(ii) The appropriate amortization of
premium (or accrual of discount) at-
tributable to the taxable year shall be
an amount which bears the same ratio
