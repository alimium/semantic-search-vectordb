Medical Comments: After changing HEPA filters at the top of the clean room (from a lift), 
employee felt pain in the right scapula (shoulder blade) area. 
ESH Comments: Changing the HEPA filters required that the employee lift each of the 5 fan/filter 
assemblies (weight = 50 lb. each) off of the clean room roof and then re-install the assemblies after 
the filters were replaced. No suitable mechanical lifting device was available to hoist the 
assemblies. Plans are being developed to install monorail-mounted hoists or similar equipment 
above the clean room to facilitate removal of the assemblies in the future. First aid treatment only. 
Medical limitations restrict the employee's ability to perform some routine duties, so case is DART.
