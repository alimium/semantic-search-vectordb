Office of the Assistant Secretary, HUD 
§ 906.15 
§ 906.9
Title restrictions and encum-
brances on properties sold under a 
homeownership program. 
(a) If the property is subject to in-
debtedness under the Annual Contribu-
tions Contract (ACC), HUD will con-
tinue to make any debt service con-
tributions for which it is obligated 
under the ACC, and the property sold 
will not be subject to the encumbrance 
of that indebtedness. 
(b) Upon sale of a public housing unit 
to a public housing tenant or eligible 
family, or to a PRE operating the units 
as non-public housing, in accordance 
with the HUD-approved homeownership 
program, HUD will execute a release of 
the title restrictions prescribed by the 
ACC. Because the property will no 
longer be subject to the ACC after sale, 
it will cease to be eligible for public 
housing Operating Fund or Capital 
Fund payments. 
Subpart C—Purchaser 
Requirements 
§ 906.11
Eligible purchasers. 
Entities that purchase units from the 
PHA for resale to low-income families 
(purchase and resale entities or PREs) 
and low-income families are eligible to 
purchase properties made available for 
sale under a PHA homeownership pro-
gram. 
§ 906.13
Right of first refusal. 
(a) In selling a public housing unit 
under a homeownership program, the 
PHA or PRE must initially offer the 
unit to the resident occupying the 
unit, if any, notwithstanding the re-
quirements of §§ 906.15(a) and 906.15(c). 
(b) This program does not require the 
PHA, when selling a unit that is a non- 
public housing unit, to offer the unit 
for sale first to the current resident of 
the unit. 
U.S.C. 1437a), at the time the contract 
to purchase the property is executed. 
(b) Principal residence requirement. 
The dwelling unit sold to an eligible 
family must be used as the principal 
residence of the family. 
(c) Financial capacity requirement. Eli-
gibility must be limited to families 
who are capable of assuming the finan-
cial 
obligations 
of 
homeownership, 
under minimum income standards for 
affordability, taking into account the 
unavailability of public housing oper-
ating 
subsidies 
and 
modernization 
funds after conveyance of the property 
by the PHA. A homeownership program 
may, however, take account of any 
available subsidy from other sources. 
Under this affordability standard, an 
applicant must meet the following re-
quirements: 
(1) Cost/income ratio. On an average 
monthly estimate, the amount of the 
applicant’s 
payments 
for 
mortgage 
principal and interest, plus insurance, 
real estate taxes, utilities, mainte-
nance, and other regularly recurring 
homeownership costs (such as condo-
minium, cooperative, or other home-
ownership association fees) will not ex-
ceed the sum of: 
(i) 35 percent of the applicant’s ad-
justed income as defined in 24 CFR part 
913; and 
(ii) Any subsidy that will be available 
for such payments; 
(2) Down payment requirement. Each 
family purchasing housing under a 
homeownership program must provide 
a down payment in connection with 
any loan for acquisition of the housing, 
in an amount determined by the PHA 
or PRE, in accordance with an ap-
proved homeownership program. Ex-
cept as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of 
this section, the PHA or PRE must per-
mit the family to use grant amounts, 
gifts from relatives, contributions from 
private sources, and other similar 
amounts in making the down payment; 
(3) The family must use its own re-
sources other than grants, gifts, con-
tributions, or similar amounts, to con-
tribute an amount of the down pay-
ment that is not less than one percent 
of the purchase price of the housing. 
The PHA or PRE must maintain 
records that are verifiable by HUD 
§ 906.15
Requirements applicable to a 
family purchasing a property under 
a homeownership program. 
(a) Low-income requirement. Except in 
the case of a PHA’s offer of first refusal 
to a resident occupying the unit under 
§ 906.13, a family purchasing a property 
under a PHA homeownership program 
must be a low-income family, as de-
fined in section 3 of the 1937 Act (42

tivities; 
(2) Criminal activity;

§ 906.17
PHA handling of homeowner-
ship applications. 
Families who are interested in pur-
chasing a unit must submit applica-
tions to the PHA or PRE for that spe-
cific purpose, and those applications 
must be handled separately from appli-
cations for other PHA programs. Appli-
cation for homeownership must not af-
fect an applicant’s place on any other 
PHA waiting list for rental units.

approved homeownership program, or 
by reconveyance to the PHA, and that

of the PHA; 
(3) Protection against fraud or mis-
use of funds or other property on the 
part of the PRE, its employees, and 
agents; 
(4) Assurances that the resale pro-
ceeds will be used only for the purposes 
specified by the HUD-approved home-
ownership program; 
(5) Limitation of the PRE’s adminis-
trative and overhead costs, and of any 
compensation or profit that may be re-
alized by the PRE, to amounts that are 
reasonable in relation to its respon-
sibilities and risks; 
(6) Accountability to the PHA and 
residents for the recordkeeping, report-
ing, and audit requirements of § 906.33; 
(7) Assurances that the PRE will ad-
minister its responsibilities under the 
plan on a nondiscriminatory basis, in 
accordance with the Fair Housing Act, 
its 
implementing 
regulations, 
and 
other applicable civil rights statutes 
and authorities, including the authori-
ties cited in § 5.105(a) of this title; and 
(8) Adequate legal remedies for the 
PHA and residents, in the event of the 
PRE’s failure to perform in accordance 
with the agreement. 
(c) Sale to low-income families. The re-
quirement for a PRE to sell units 
under a homeownership program only 
to low-income families must be re-
corded as a deed restriction at the time 
of purchase by the PRE. 
(d) Resale within five years. A PRE 
must agree that, with respect to any 
units it acquires under a homeowner-
ship program under this part, it will 
transfer ownership to the PHA if the 
PRE fails to resell the unit to a low-in-
come family within 5 years of the 
PRE’s acquisition of the unit. 
Subpart D—Program 
Administration 
§ 906.19
Requirements applicable to a 
purchase and resale entity (PRE). 
(a) In general. In the case of a pur-
chase of units for resale to low-income 
families by a PRE, the PHA must have 
an approved homeownership program 
that describes the use of a PRE to sell 
the units to low-income families with-
in 5 years from the date of the PRE’s 
acquisition of the units. 
(b) PRE requirements. The PHA must 
demonstrate in its homeownership pro-
gram that the PRE has the necessary 
legal capacity and administrative ca-
pability to carry out its responsibil-
ities under the program. The PHA’s 
homeownership 
program 
also 
must 
contain a written agreement (not re-
quired to be submitted as part of the 
homeownership plan) that specifies the 
respective rights and obligations of the 
PHA and the PRE, and which includes: 
(1) Assurances that the PRE will 
comply with all provisions of the HUD- 
approved homeownership program; 
(2) Assurances that the PRE will be 
subject to a title restriction providing 
that the property must be resold or 
otherwise transferred only by convey-
ance of individual dwellings to eligible
