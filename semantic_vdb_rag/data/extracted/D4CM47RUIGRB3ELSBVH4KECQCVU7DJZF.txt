legislative counsel’s digest
SB 1450, as amended, Simitian. Water: Delta Stewardship Council:
contracts.
The Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta Reform Act of 2009 establishes
the Delta Stewardship Council, which is required to develop, adopt,
and commence implementation of a comprehensive management plan
for the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta (Delta Plan) by January 1, 2012.
The act provides that the council is the successor to the California
Bay-Delta Authority and requires the council to administer contracts,
grants, easements, and agreements made or entered into by the authority.
The act prescribes the powers of the council, which include, among
others, the power to enter into contracts, to hire employees, and to adopt
regulations or guidelines.
Existing law prescribes requirements for selection of firms by state
and local agency heads for architectural and engineering services and
other professional services.
This bill would expressly authorize the council to contract for
consultant services and architectural and engineering services to assist

with preparation of the Delta Plan and performance of certain
responsibilities of the council. The bill would exempt these contracts
for consultant services from specified provisions of law governing
public contracting, but would require the contracts to be entered into
on a competitive bid basis, as specified. The bill would require contracts
for architectural and engineering services to be entered into pursuant
to the requirements for selection of firms by state and local agency
heads discussed above, but would exempt those contracts from a
requirement to adopt regulations prior to contracting. The bill would
require the council to establish procedures for contracting for consultant
services and architectural and engineering services.
This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an
urgency statute.
