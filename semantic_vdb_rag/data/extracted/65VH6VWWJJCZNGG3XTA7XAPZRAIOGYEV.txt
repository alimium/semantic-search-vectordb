Model: 
AR318-02 
 
Type: 
The AR318-02 is a single-shaft turboprop engine comprising a single stage centrifugal 
compressor, a reverse flow annular combustion chamber, and a two stage axial turbine.  
An integral main reduction and accessory gearbox is driven by a forward extension of the 
compressor shaft and has provisions for a starter-generator unit, fuel pump and control 
system, propeller governor, oil pump and aircraft accessories.  One aircraft bleed air port 
is provided.

3 
The aviation authority for Italy, Ente Nazioonale per l’Aviazione Civile (ENAC) (formerly Registro Aeronautico Italiano), 
originally type certificated this engine. The FAA validated this product under U.S. Type Certificate Number E22NE. Effective 
September 28, 2003, the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) began oversight of this product on behalf of Italy. 
 
Import Requirements: 
To be considered eligible for installation on U.S. registered aircraft, each new engine to be exported to 
the United States with ENAC or EASA airworthiness approval shall have a Joint Aviation Authorities 
(JAA) or EASA Form 1, Authorized Release Certificate.  The JAA or EASA Form 1 should state that 
the engine conforms to the type design approved under the U.S. Type Certificate E22NE is in a 
condition for safe operation and has undergone a final operational check.
