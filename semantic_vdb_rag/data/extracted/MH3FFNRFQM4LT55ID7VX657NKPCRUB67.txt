THIRD PARTY DISCLAIMER 
This report and all subsidiary reports are prepared solely for the Federal Transit Administration 
(FTA).  This report should not be relied upon by any party, except FTA or the project sponsor, in 
accordance with the purposes as described below. 
For projects funded through FTA Full Funding Grant Agreements (FFGAs) program, FTA and 
its Project Management Oversight contractor (PMOC) use a risk-based assessment process to 
review and validate a project sponsor’s budget and schedule.  This risk-based assessment process 
is a tool for analyzing project development and management.  Moreover, the assessment process 
is iterative in nature; any results of an FTA or PMOC risk-based assessment represent a 
“snapshot in time” for a particular project under the conditions known at that same point in time. 
The status of any assessment may be altered at any time by new information, changes in 
circumstances, or further developments in the project, including any specific measures a sponsor 
may take to mitigate the risks to project costs, budget, and schedule, or the strategy a sponsor 
may develop for project execution.  Therefore, the information in the monthly reports will 
change from month to month, based on relevant factors for the month and/or previous months. 
REPORT FORMAT AND FOCUS 
This report is submitted in compliance with the terms of the Federal Transit Administration 
(FTA) Contract No. DTFT60-09-D-00007, Task Order No. 002.  Its purpose is to provide 
information and data to assist the FTA as it continually monitors the grantee’s technical 
capability and capacity to execute a project efficiently and effectively, and hence, whether the 
grantee continues to be ready to receive federal funds for further project development. 
This report covers the project management activities on the East Side Access (ESA) Mega-
Project managed by MTA Capital Construction (MTACC) with MTA as the grantee and 
financed by the FTA FFGA.  
MONITORING REPORT 
1.0 PROJECT STATUS 
a. Design   
As of July 31, 2013, MTACC reported that the Engineering/Design effort was 97.7% complete 
in the ESA July ’13 Monthly Progress Report; however the Cost Report shows only 93.1% 
complete on a cost invoiced basis.  The percent complete varies monthly depending on the award 
of tasks to the GEC.  
The 100% submittal for the Stage 3 catenary design (FHA03) was sent to Amtrak on May 3, 
2013 and discussed with them in early July.  Amtrak requested a walk-through on July 26, 2013 
to address the bonding and grounding plan, which resulted in additional comments that the 
Project Management Team (PMT) subsequently addressed.  The 100% submittal is now 
finalized.  
Amtrak is currently reviewing the FHA04 Stage 4 catenary 60% design submittal and ESA is 
waiting for comments.  The PMT is proceeding with the 90% design and anticipates completing 
it by the end of September 2013. 
The confirmatory set of drawings for CM014B was circulated between the major stakeholders 
(LIRR, MNR) in April 2013 for assurance that all of their comments have been adequately

PMT’s calculations on procurement are done against the $8.245B budget, without the Rolling 
Stock Reserve. 
The second new contract package of the CM012R repackaging, CM006 (northern structures), 
was advertised on August 15, 2013, with RFP documents made available to perspective 
proposers on August 26, 2013.  The current RFP due date is October 17, 2013.  The third new 
contract package, CM007 (Main Caverns) remains under development.  The advertise date for 
this package remains TBD.   
The continuing slippage of awarding CS179 (Systems Package 1) remains a major concern.  This 
contract is on the critical path of the May 2012 approved baseline schedule.  MTACC committed 
in April 2013 to have a recommendation for award ready to present to the MTA Board in July 
2013, and that date was not met.  The ESA PMT then re-forecast recommendation to award 
ready to present at September 2013 MTA Board meeting, with award of the Contract following 
in late September/early October 2013.  The PMOC was informed in August 2013 that MTACC 
will not have a recommendation for award in time for the September 2013 Board meeting, as the 
ESA team continues negotiations and has yet to select a contractor.  The planned award date and 
NTP remains TBD. 
The PMT has decided to split the Tunnel Systems package (CS284) into two packages: one for 
track work and one for the traction power work.  Procurement dates for this package are now 
TBD.  This split will have an impact on the Systems Package 1 (CS179) Contractor, who is 
responsible for systems integration for these packages.   
Notice to Proceed (NTP) for the Signal Equipment package (VS086), which is being negotiated 
as an RFP, remains TBD (note: proposals for this RFP were received in January 2013). 
The previous IPS update indicates that the CM014B package will be ready to advertise on 
September 1, 2013.  The ESA PMT has stopped providing IPS updates, so there is no current 
forecast on when this package will be advertised, however it clearly will not be September 1, 
2013. 
Bids were opened for CH057A on August 8, 2013.  There were eight bidders and the low bid 
was $104,300,000, which was under the ESA’s budgeted amount.  Formal award is expected in 
September 2013.  Remaining work in CH057 was forecast in the previous IPS to be advertised in 
August 2013, with NTP forecast for January 2014.  The date is now TBD as the PMT considers 
repackaging options based on the outcome of the Harold work schedule review/re-baselining that 
it is conducting. 
c. Construction  
The PMT reported in its July 2013 Monthly Progress Report that the actual construction progress 
was 52.9% vs. 55.1% planned.  Over the last several months, progress has only been proceeding 
at about half the rate as projected.    
Manhattan:  CM009/019 – Manhattan Tunnels Excavation/Structures Part 1:  The Estimate 
at Completion (EAC) for the CM009 contract remained at $402,706,000 as of July 31, 2013.  
Substantial Completion (SC) of the base contract was achieved on June 1, 2013, after which the 
MTACC awarded Contract Modification #46 to the contractor for the application of shotcrete 
and invert construction in 3 of the previously excavated caverns.  This work is advance 
construction for the future CM006 contract.  The MTACC established new Milestone 9A, with a 
August 2013 Monthly Report 
5 
MTACC-ESA 
 
 
Substantial Completion date of September 30, 2013.  Actual progress for July 2013 was 1.3% 
versus 1.8% planned.  Cumulative progress through July 31, 2013, adjusted for Milestone 9A, 
was 96.2% actual versus 96.4% planned.   
CM019 Status:  All construction for Substantial Completion (except punch list repairs) was 
completed by June 1, 2013, but the PMT has not been able to declare SC yet because of an on-
going Code Compliance issue with pneumatically applied concrete (PAC) that CM019 used 
throughout the caverns.  Currently, the issue is being reviewed by an independent engineer, but 
there is no estimated date for a decision.  Until this determination is made, the PMT will not be 
able to issue a Substantial Completion notice.   
Construction Progress:  During August 2013, the CM009 contractor continued construction with 
the installation of waterproofing and reinforcing bars, and the initial placement of invert concrete 
in the GCT 3 and GCT 4 West Wye and Crossover caverns and the GCT 5 West Wye cavern.  
CM013 – 50th Street Vent Facility:  MTACC reports that through July 31, 2013, the EAC 
remains at $126.41 million.  Forecast Substantial Completion date has changed to December 31, 
2013 from the previous November 2013.  As of July 31, 2013, the actual percent complete was 
85.2% vs. 99.9% planned.   
Construction Progress:  The stop-work-order issued by the Code Compliance Unit (CCU) over 
the placement of PAC was “partially” lifted during August 2013.  This allowed the resumption of 
Stair #1 construction in the shaft.  The erection, inspection and approval of a CCU required 
mock-up of the pneumatic concrete wall remains.  Concrete slab placement within the building is 
complete.  Concrete block wall erection is 90% complete throughout the building.  Preparations 
began for the installation of the finish building and utility chase cladding.   
CM013A – 55th Street Vent Facility: MTACC reports that through July 31, 2013 the EAC 
remained at $58.85 million. Forecast Substantial Completion date is now March 11, 2015 from 
the original and previous April 5, 2015. As of July 31, 2013, MTACC reports that the actual 
percent complete is slightly ahead of schedule at 16.1% vs. 15.3% planned.   
Construction Progress:  During August 2013, the contractor continued with mechanical 
excavation in the northeast and northwest sections of the site and began excavation at the 
southwest section under the street decking.  Installation of temporary sewer bypass and steam 
main was completed.  Support of utilities under the decking continued, and the Project Office 
continues to work with Con Ed on expediting their required abatement work so that steam main 
work can proceed. 
CM004 – 44th Street Building Demolition and Fan Plant Structure; 245 Park Avenue 
Entrance: MTACC reports that through July 31, 2013 the EAC remained at $63.33 million.  The 
Forecast Substantial Completion date is January 15, 2014 for the Vent Plant. Beneficial Use for 
the 245 Park Entrance is forecast for January 15, 2014. The actual percent complete is 85.5% 
versus 95.2% planned.  
Construction Progress:  The above-grade steel erection is complete. The remaining below grade 
steel fabrication is complete and erection of this steel is forthcoming.  This below grade steel is 
necessary for the placement of the ground floor concrete slab and support for the Gantry Crane 
that is being re-installed in the building to support upcoming contracts.  The second floor steel 
has been fabricated.  This steel, some louvers, windows, limestone building finish and other 
August 2013 Monthly Report

MTACC-ESA 
 
 
materials will be stored for installation by the CM014B contractor after the Gantry Crane is 
removed.  The contractor continued with application of intumescent paint and column/beam 
concrete encasement. Completion of temporary stair erection continued. 
CM014A– Concourse and Facilities Fit-Out:  MTACC reports that through July 31, 2013 the 
EAC remains at $52.00 million.  Forecast Substantial Completion date remains February 15, 
2014. The actual percent complete reported is 44.5% versus 85.9% planned. This large gap 
between percent complete versus planned can be largely attributed to the Supervisory Control 
and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system redesign (based on LIRR requirements), which resulted 
in a hold being placed on fabrication and delivery of all power system equipment until the 
redesign was complete. 
Construction Progress: During August 2013, the contractor completed floor slab placement.  
Masons continued with block wall erection for various rooms. Placement of equipment pads 
began and erection of sheet metal ductwork and overhead piping continued.  HVAC units were 
delivered and stored at the site.  Testing of ABB Transformers was successfully completed at the 
Texas plant under the observation of an MTACC representative. 
Queens:  CQ031 – Queens Bored Tunnels and Structures:  The Estimate at Completion 
remained at $780,384,000 as of July 31, 2013.  The MTACC forecast for Substantial Completion 
of the amended CQ031 contract has been extended to April 9, 2014.  The amended contract 
presently includes installation of secant piles and support of excavation (SOE) for the eastward 
extension of Tunnel A and the construction of a concrete slab for track support under 
Amtrak/LIRR Lines 2 and 4 for the future Westbound Bypass Tunnel.    Cumulative progress 
through July 31, 2013 was 97.5% versus 100.0% planned.   
Construction Progress:  During August 2013, the contractor successfully completed installation 
of the concrete slabs under Lines 2 and 4 and continued to install SOE secant and soldier piles 
for the extension of Tunnel A.  As of August 29, 2013, the contractor had installed 179 secant 
piles (of a total of 246) and all 30 soldier piles.  Additionally, the contractor continued final 
painting and punch list repairs at the Yard Lead Emergency Exit and B-13 Substation buildings. 
CQ032 – Plaza Substation and Queens Structures:  The Estimate at Completion remained at 
$192,680,000 as of July 31, 2013.  The MTACC forecast Substantial Completion date has been 
extended by a month to August 1, 2015.  Actual construction progress for July 2013 was 3.5% 
versus 3.9% planned.  Cumulative progress through July 31, 2013, was 33.3% actual versus 
61.7% planned.  ESA and the Contractor are presently developing a re-baselined Contract 
schedule based upon additional work on the 63rd street eastbound tunnel rehabilitation that will 
more accurately reflect the status of actual vs. planned work. 
Construction Progress:  During August 2013, the contractor completed excavation in Area 1A, 
continued to pour concrete invert slab sections in the Plaza Substation area, continued 
waterproofing and shotcrete application in the Yard Lead Trench, continued to install CMU 
walls on the exterior and interior of B-10 Substation, and continued miscellaneous construction 
at the intermediate facility buildings at Roosevelt Ave., Vernon Blvd, and 12th and 29th streets.  
CQ039 – Northern Boulevard Crossing:  As of July 31, 2013, the Estimate at Completion 
remained at $101,605,000.  The MTACC forecast Substantial Completion date was extended by 
3 weeks to September 6, 2013.  Actual construction progress for July 2013 was 0.6% versus 
August 2013 Monthly Report 
7 
MTACC-ESA 
 
 
0.0% planned (project was expected to be complete by now).  Cumulative construction progress 
through July 31, 2013, was 96.5% versus 100.0%.   
Construction Progress:  The contractor completed removal of the four remaining support piles 
that were located inside the Northern Blvd. tunnel in late July 2013, and made punch list repairs 
during August.  All major construction at the site has been completed, but Substantial 
Completion will not be declared until the compensation grouting behind the tunnel liner is 
complete.  This process is presently being delayed because the ground around the tunnel liner has 
not fully thawed from the ground freeze (thaw was begun in February/March 2013 timeframe).  
There is no forecast date for when the full thaw will occur. 
Harold Interlocking:  CH053 Contract – Harold Structures Part 1 and G.0.2 Substation: 
Through July 31, 2013, the Estimate at Completion remains at $281,038,000.  The MTACC 
forecast Substantial Completion date was extended by one week to June 11, 2014.  Actual 
construction progress for July 2013 was 1.2% versus 0.0% planned (project was supposed to 
have been completed).  Cumulative construction progress through July 31, 2013, was 81.0% 
actual versus 100.0% planned.  Although significantly behind schedule, this contract is not 
currently on the overall ESA project critical path. 
Construction Progress:  The CH053 contractor completed removal of existing signal towers 29 
through 34 during August 2013.  This allowed the contractor to resume installation in support of 
excavation (SOE) and excavation for the westward extension of the Tunnel A Approach 
structure (the towers prevented this previously).  The contractor also continued construction of 
the bridge abutments at 43rd and 48th streets for the new realigned LIRR ML4 track and 
continued construction of the 43-S2 retaining wall between 43rd and 48th streets.  Due to limited 
Force Account support because of the continuous westbound bypass concrete slab construction 
during the first half of August 2013, the contractor’s progress on the 12kV ductbank and cable 
installation was greatly restricted, although a small amount of miscellaneous progress was made.  
CH054A – Harold Structures Part 2A:  The Estimate at Completion remains at $64,271,000, 
although the forecast Substantial Completion date has been extended to May 29, 2014.  Actual 
construction progress for July 2013 was 2.0% versus 0.0% planned (project was supposed to be 
complete).  Cumulative construction progress through July 31, 2013, was 54.6% actual versus 
100.0% planned.  Although significantly behind schedule, this contract is not currently on the 
overall ESA project critical path. 
Construction Progress:  During August 2013, the contractor continued installation of 12kV 
ductbank west of electric manhole #20.   
Railroad Force Account: 
FHA01 – Harold Stage 1 Amtrak:  The Estimate at Completion remained at $16,382,000 
through July 2013.  The MTACC’s forecast for Substantial Completion of FHA01 was extended 
5 weeks to June 11, 2014.  Actual construction progress for July 2013 was 1.3% versus 1.3% 
planned.  Cumulative construction progress through July 31, 2013, was 90.4% actual versus 
92.5% planned.  The bulk of the remaining FHA01 construction consists of Electric Traction 
(ET) relocation of catenary wires on structures erected by the CH053/CH054A contractor, as 
well as ET protection for the contractor.  FHA01 is not presently on the critical path for the 
overall ESA project.  
August 2013 Monthly Report 
8 
MTACC-ESA 
 
 
Construction Progress:  During August 2013, Amtrak Force Account ET personnel continued to 
make various catenary wire relocations and other catenary modifications throughout Harold 
Interlocking as required by the approved design.   
FHA02 – Harold Stage 2 Amtrak:  The Estimate at Completion remained at $38,495,000 
during July 2013.  The MTACC’s forecast for Substantial Completion also remained at June 8, 
2014.  Actual construction progress for July 2013 was 2.3% versus 2.8% planned.  Cumulative 
construction progress through July 31, 2013, was 67.3% actual versus 81.7% planned.  The 
majority of the remaining 2013 work will be the Communications and Signals (C&S) installation 
and cutover of “F1” Interlocking.  The cutover is presently scheduled for the weekend of 
November 1 – 3, 2013.  FHA02 is not currently on the critical path of the overall ESA project.  
Construction Progress:  Amtrak Communications personnel completed installation of main 
communication cables into the “F1” CIH and Signal personnel continued to install conduits and 
cable and make circuit revisions and cable terminations for the “F1” CIH.  Additionally, C&S 
personnel continued to install signal cables from the “F1” CIH to the various signal cases 
throughout “F1” Interlocking.   
FHA03 – Harold Stage 3 Amtrak:  The ESA PMT opened Stage 3 of the project in July 2013 
with the authorization for all Amtrak disciplines to participate in the installation of the concrete 
slabs for the support of Lines 2 and 4 for when the future jacked box for the Westbound Bypass 
tunnel is installed.  This involved Track Department removal and reconstruction of 
approximately 1,000 LF of each track along with the appropriate C&S and ET support as the 
slabs were installed.  The ESA PMT established an initial Estimate at Completion of $1,914,000 
for the work with a Substantial Completion date of August 20, 2013.  A special summer track 
outage was scheduled from July 19 to August 18, 2013, for the construction.  As of August 31, 
2013, Amtrak completed all of its planned work for this early Stage 3 task on schedule. 
Construction Progress:  Amtrak Track personnel removed and reconstructed approximately 
1,000 LF of Line 2 during July 2013 and approximately 1,000 LF of Line 4 during August 2013.  
The C&S and ET Departments supported this work as appropriate during the summer track 
outage.     
FHL01 – Harold Stage 1 LIRR:  The Estimate at Completion remained at $21,860,000 during 
July 2013.  The MTACC’s forecast for Substantial Completion was extended 3 weeks to 
September 24, 2014.  No construction progress was made on FHL01 during July 2013 because 
all LIRR Force Account efforts were concentrated on FHL02 and FHL03 work.  As a result, the 
cumulative construction progress through July 31, 2013 was 75.2% actual versus 86.4% planned.  
Remaining FHL01 work includes installation of track turnouts, C&S equipment installation to 
prepare for Stage 2 cutovers of Harold and Point Interlockings, and traction power relocations 
and cutover of the signal power line, as well as cable installation for the re-located GO2 
Substation.  FHL01 is not currently on the critical path for the overall ESA project. 
Construction Progress:  As noted above, there was no FHL01 construction during July 2013. 
FHL02 – Harold Stage 2 LIRR:  The Estimate at Completion for FHL02 remained at 
$64,457,000 during July 2013.  The MTACC’s forecast for Substantial Completion remained at 
November 17, 2015.  Actual construction progress for July 2013 was 1.6% versus 2.2% planned.  
Cumulative construction progress through July 31, 2013, was 26.8% actual versus 30.8% 
planned.  Remaining work in FHL02 includes installation of 15 track turnouts, installation of 6 
August 2013 Monthly Report

MTACC-ESA 
 
 
Central Instrument Locations (CILs) in Harold Interlocking, installation of new third rail for 
additional tracks that will be constructed, and separation of the new LIRR signal power system 
from the existing Amtrak signal power system.   
Construction Progress:  During July 2013, LIRR C&S personnel continued to test, make circuit 
revisions, and other preparations for the cutovers of the new Point Interlocking and several new 
signal cases in Harold Interlocking which are scheduled for cutover in 4Q2013.   
FHL03 – Harold Stage 3 LIRR:  In conjunction with the concrete slab installation noted in 
FHA03, above, and in order to make maximum use of the special summer track outage, the ESA 
PMT authorized the LIRR to begin work on Stage 3 with its approval to renew approximately 
900 LF of track on Lines 2 and 4 and install 2 turnouts contiguous with the Amtrak work.  The 
ESA PMT has not established an initial Estimate at Completion for this early LIRR Stage 3 work 
yet, but it did establish the Substantial Completion date of August 20, 2013.  Monthly and 
cumulative construction progress was the same through July 31, 2013.  Actual progress was 
25.0% versus 25.0% planned.   
Construction Progress:  LIRR Track personnel removed and reconstructed approximately 900 LF 
of track and installed 1 new turnout on Line 2 during July 2013.  In August 2013, LIRR Track 
personnel removed and reconstructed approximately 900 LF of track and installed 1 new turnout 
on Line 4.   
d. Quality Assurance and Quality Control (QA/QC)  
ESA Project Quality Manual (PQM):  The ESA Quality Manager and MTACC’s Chief of 
Quality, Safety, and Site Security are still finalizing a draft of Revision 7 of the PQM and it is 
now scheduled to be sent to the PMOC for review by the middle of September 2013.  
Submission of As-Builts:  The construction Contractor for the CH053, CH054A, and CQ032 
Contracts continues to submit as-built drawings late and those that are submitted are not being 
sent as CAD files per contractual requirement, so ESA asked the GEC to convert them to the 
proper format.  The PMOC is concerned that this issue is still not resolved and that the 
Contractor is not complying with their contractual requirement.  The PMOC recommends that 
ESA management press to immediately resolve this issue. 
PMP-Related Procedures Training:  MTACC has issued 78 procedures.  Training for the ESA 
staff commenced in July 2013. On August 7, 2013, training was conducted for 45 ESA 
employees on seven MTACC Construction Procedures and on August 21, 2013, 51 ESA 
employees were trained on one Configuration Management Procedure.  Training for six more 
Construction Procedures is scheduled for September 4, 2013.  MTACC plans to conduct training 
sessions every two weeks and cover additional subjects including Safety and Administration.    
The PMOC will continue to monitor progress in this area.   
2.0 SCHEDULE DATA  
The PMT did not submit its IPS#50 this month, and stated in its monthly report that “ESA 
continues its program level review with a target for issuing a revised draft baseline for review in 
September 2013.  Until such time as that rebaseline is issued, the monthly schedule report will 
only contain narrative and simple start, finish dates for active contracts.”  ESA has stated in its 
June 2013 Quarterly Progress Report that a draft baseline will be ready for review in mid-
September 2013.   
August 2013 Monthly Report

MTACC-ESA 
 
 
The ESA PMT briefed the FTA/PMOC on the CM005/006 contracts cost and schedule status on 
August 16, 2013.  The CM005 Contract has a 29 month duration (to substantial completion).  
The CM006 Contract has a schedule duration projection of 32 months (inclusive of two months 
embedded contingency). 
ESA presented a preliminary “top down” schedule for Contract CM007 as part of a briefing to 
the FTA/PMOC on that Contract on August 28, 2013.  The overall duration of this contract is 39 
months with a projected NTP of April 7, 2016 (unlimited access) and Substantial Completion on 
July 5, 2019.  NTP for limited access is projected to occur on July 1, 2015 when/if funding 
becomes available.  Between July 1, 2015 and April 7, 2016 procurement of pre-cast concrete 
will commence, as well as other submittals and administrative requirements.  The unlimited NTP 
start date on April 7, 2016 coincides with the substantial completion of CM005 – Manhattan 
South Structures and the expiration of a two (2) month hand-off period between contracts.  This 
Contract will also have two months of embedded contingency.    
As it currently stands, the original 42 month projected duration of the CM012R Package has 
become 69-months for the re-packaged scope of work. 
Project Critical Path: ESA’s 2012 baseline schedule critical path went through Contracts 
CM012R (42 months), then a portion of Contract CS179 (only 8 months of total Contract 
duration), then IST (15 months), and finally LIRR IST (3 months),  The PMOC believes that the 
new critical path will have the same structure, with CM005, CM006, CM007 replacing 
CM012R,  however the current project critical path cannot be determined until ESA provides an 
Integrated Project Schedule which it has stated it will not do until the future contracts are 
incorporated and properly linked in the IPS. 
Schedule Contingency:  Schedule contingency must be developed as part of the Program re-
baselining effort.  At present, there is no schedule contingency for the Program given that 
CM007 is now projected to finish 3 months before the current RSD. 
3.0 COST DATA  
Funding: MTACC announced at the May 2012 Capital Program Oversight Committee (CPOC) 
meeting that an additional $720 million will need to be identified in the MTA 2015 – 2019 
Capital Plan to cover the new project baseline budget.  The funding request for the 2015 – 2019 
Capital Program will be submitted to the NYS Capital Program Review Board (CPRB) in 
September 2014.  The MTA stated in April 2013 that it would review any Program budget 
changes resulting from the new packaging plan for CM012R and compare it to funding 
availability in the current MTA Capital Plan.  Results of this comparison were to be discussed 
internally with the MTA Board in July 2013.  As of this report the PMOC has not been informed 
as to whether or not this discussion occurred.   
Budget/Cost:  The PMT has reported that as of July 31, 2013, the actual total project progress 
was 57.0% vs. 58.7% planned progress resulting from the Current Baseline Budget (CBB) and 
the actual construction progress was 52.9% vs. 55.1% planned based on invoiced amount.   
As of July 31 2013, the Current Baseline Budget (CBB) as shown in the Standard Cost 
Categories (SCCs) remains at the baseline value of $8.708 billion.  There were two (2) changes 
in SCCs this month arising from transfers of scope related to the former CM012R Package.  SCC 
#10 (Guideway and Track Elements) increased by approximately $3M and SCC #20 (Stations,

ESA conducted a Risk Workshop for CM006 in June 2013 and distributed some input data to the 
participants for comment.  The PMOC provided its comments on this data in July 2013.  
MTACC is planning to issue the final report with the results in early September 2013.  
The systems work and associated packages (CS179, CS284, and CS084) continue to be 
evaluated for interface issues.  ESA planned to re-run the risk model developed from the April 
2013 Systems Risk Workshop in August 2013 using revised data based on a more current 
definition of the interface milestones associated with the CM012R repackaged contracts CM005; 
CM006; and CM007. The model has not been re-run as of the end of August 2013. 
Minimal progress has been made on producing an Integrated Master Schedule which overlays 
the ESA Harold work schedule on an Amtrak Program of Projects that may compete for limited 
resources.  Amtrak provided a schedule for the Moynihan project for remaining work in 2013; 
however ESA has yet to develop the framework for the Integrated Master Schedule. 
ESA is currently working on schedule and cost estimate reviews for both the CM007 and 
CM014B contracts.  These reviews will include updated milestone information available from 
the CM005 bid and the CM006 risk workshops that will revise contract interfaces and milestones 
in the Program IPS.  The CM014B risk workshop is expected to begin when the schedule and 
estimate reviews are completed.  The CM007 risk workshop is forecast for some time in the 
4Q2013 and is anticipated to be done between issuance of the Request for Expressions of Interest 
and the Request for Proposals. 
The 4D model for the CM007 contract presented at the August 28, 2013 meeting did not address 
interfaces with other contracts.  In order to be a truly useful tool, the PMOC recommends that the 
model be updated to provide a capability to run “clash detection” among all interfaced contracts.  
This capability will allow for a more accurate determination of the interface risks associated with 
this contract and will make the results of a risk assessment more meaningful.  
The Contract Packaging Plan (CPP) will be updated after the re-baseline is completed.  There is 
currently no forecast date for issuing the updated CPP. 
5.0 ELPEP COMPLIANCE SUMMARY  
The current status of each of the main ELPEP components is summarized as follows:  
 Technical Capacity and Capability (TCC):  The PMOC has completed its review of 
the draft PMP Revision 9.0, and forwarded its comments to the FTA-RII Office in 
August 2013.  Regarding PMP training, the PMOC has been advised that MTACC has 
completed its audits to establish where training efforts need to be focused.  The audit 
report was forecast to be available in August 2013; however MTACC is now forecasting 
that the report will be available in September 2013.  MTACC started procedures training 
in July 2013.  The PMOC will continue to monitor progress in this area. PMOC’s review 
of the MTACC update to the March 2010 Technical Capacity and Capability Plan for 
ESA and SAS has been completed and comments were forwarded to FTA-RII Office in 
August, 2013.  
 Risk Mitigation Capacity Plan (RMCP):  FTA-RII provided its conditional acceptance 
of the RMCP in its May 24, 2012 letter to MTACC.  The PMOC has verified RMCP final 
acceptance based on its incorporation into the RMP. 
August 2013 Monthly Report 
13 
MTACC-ESA 
 
 
 Risk Management Plan (RMP):  FTA formally notified MTACC of its conditional 
acceptance of the RMP (Rev. 2) by letter dated March 4, 2013, based on MTACC 
correcting an error and expanding discussion of certain risk and mitigation topics.  
 Continuing ELPEP Compliance: The following ELPEP components continue to need 
improvement:  Management Decision; Design Development; CCC Process and Results; 
Stakeholder Management; Issues Management; Procurement; Timely Decision Making; 
Risk-Informed Decision Making. 
The next ELPEP Quarterly Review Meeting with MTACC, FTA-RII, SAS and ESA projects and 
the PMOC is scheduled for September 12, 2013. 
With MTACC’s submission of its East Side Access FTA Quarterly Report (Apr, May, June ’13) 
and the July 2013 monthly report, the PMOC notes that the ESA project is not in compliance 
with ELPEP and is not meeting some of the more important requirements of the SMP and CMP 
sub-plans to the PMP.  The PMOC’s major areas of concern include: 
 ELPEP: MTACC is not forecasting and trending either cost or schedule contingency 
accurately because it does not include the significant cost, schedule and contingency 
impacts of the CM012R bids over budget event and subsequent cancellation of the 
procurement in 4Q2012.  ESA has not accurately calculated the schedule contingency 
utilization resulting from the repackaging of CM012R and the major procurement delays.  
ESA has also not addressed the need for utilizing project cost contingency to cover the 
budget shortfall.  
 Schedule Management Plan:  The ESA project is non-compliant with requirements for 
IPS Updating, Forecasting, and Schedule Contingency Management.  Additionally, ESA 
is no longer providing any schedule information about future planned contract packages 
and has ceased providing the monthly IPS updates. 
 Cost Management Plan:  The ESA project is non-compliant with requirements for Cost 
Estimating, Contract Level EAC Forecasting, Project Level EAC Forecasting, Project 
Level EAC Forecast Validation, Monthly Update Process and MTACC Cost Contingency 
Management and Secondary Mitigation. 
Revisions to the ELPEP Document:  On March 19, 2013, MTACC provided the FTA and the 
PMOC with its proposed revisions to the ELPEP.  The FTA and MTACC have agreed to hold 
working meetings to progress development of a revised ELPEP.  These meetings had been 
expected to start during 2Q2013 but have been delayed pending agreement on how to proceed 
without the revised ESA cost and schedule baselines, which are needed to provide a 
comprehensive revision to the ELPEP document.

SAFETY AND SECURITY 
Project safety statistics for lost time accidents continue to trend above the Bureau of Labor 
Statistics (BLS) national average at 2.23 vs. 2.20 lost time accidents per 200,000 hours.  
Although there has been continuing improvement in the overall project safety statistics (2.23 vs. 
2.25 during the last reporting period), several contracts have statistics above the average for the 
project.  For the CM004 Contract, the lost time accidents are trending above the ESA Project 
average (3.07 vs. 2.23 lost time accidents per 200,000 hours).  On the CQ039 Contract, which is 
nearing completion, the lost time accident statistics continue to trend well above the ESA Project

average (5.16 vs. 2.23 lost time accidents per 200,000 hours).  ESA did not report any significant 
security issues for the August 2013 reporting period. 
7.0 
ISSUES AND RECOMMENDATIONS  
Design: The PMOC remains concerned that the GEC and PMT continue to consistently miss all 
of their target dates for remaining design activities on the project, not just catenary design.  The 
level of effort for the GEC will increase significantly given the development of the CM007 
Contract Package and the potential scopes shifts being considered for the remaining Harold 
Contract Packages.  The PMOC has recommended that the PMT develop a tracking sheet with 
firm dates for interim milestones as a tool to augment the design management process. 
Procurement:  The lack of stability in the Contract Packaging Plan remains a concern.  The 
PMT continues to shift and split scope among different packages, making it difficult to fully 
understand the impact of these changes to the overall ESA Program at this time.  The ESA PMT 
is now looking at repackaging the CH057 and CH058 Contracts.  The PMOC recommends that 
the PMT give priority to producing an updated Contract Packaging Plan and adhere to it without 
shifting scope for the remainder of the project. 
The August 1, 2013 planned advertise date for the CM006 (northern structures) package was not 
met (this is the second time advertise date has slipped, initial forecast for advertising was July 1, 
2013) and the advertisement was posted on August 15, 2013, with proposal packages available 
on August 26, 2013.  Advertise date for the CM007 (caverns) package remains TBD.  These are 
critical packages and the continuing slippage of the procurement dates for them is of concern. 
The PMOC also remains seriously concerned about delays to other significant procurements, 
namely: Systems Package 1 (CS179) (currently in negotiations since 2Q2012); CS184 (Tunnel 
Systems which has now been split into two packages); VS086 (Signal Equipment) and CM014B 
(GCT Concourse and Fit-out).  The Systems work is on the project critical path and award dates 
for the Systems packages remain TBD. 
Contract CM004: The PMOC has previously reported on the issues with 245 Park Ave. 
Entrance, particularly issues with the escalator and acceptance and opening of the entrance by 
MNR. As of the date of this report, the Project Office forecasts that it will commission the 
escalator in September 2013 as previously reported.  MTACC has revised the date for Beneficial 
Use to January 15, 2014. The previously reported issues (MNR acceptance and operations of the 
escalator and acceptance of architectural railing) are nearing resolution.  The PMOC will 
continue to monitor these issues to confirm the new forecast date is met. 
Contract CM013: Through July 31, 2013, the stop work order issued by the MTACC Code 
Compliance Unit (CCU) for the application of Pneumatically Applied Concrete (PAC) was 
partially lifted, allowing work in the shaft to resume. The PMOC remains concerned that the 
impact on the substantial completion date cannot be determined, as the entire stop-work-order 
has not been lifted. 
Contract CQ032:  The PMOC notes that the gap between the actual progress and planned 
progress for CQ032 increased from 2.7% to 28.4%.  Even though the PMT has informed the 
PMOC that the Contract will be re-baselined, which could alleviate this discrepancy, it has not 
yet been done.  As a result, the PMOC remains concerned that the Contractor will not be able to 
August 2013 Monthly Report 
15 
MTACC-ESA 
 
 
recover any of the lost time.  The PMOC recommends that PMT expedite development of the re-
baselined schedule and then follow the new schedule explicitly. 
Contract CQ039:  The CQ039 contractor completed removal of the four remaining support piles 
inside the Northern Boulevard tunnel in late July 2013.  Other than punch list repairs, the only 
remaining construction issue is final compensation grout installation, which cannot be done until 
the ground surrounding the tunnel achieves sufficient thaw.  To date, this has not occurred.  
Additionally, there are still outstanding contractual issues that must be resolved before the 
contractor can declare Final Completion.  Because the contractor is thawing the ground naturally, 
without any outside influences, it is uncertain when the ground will thaw and, consequently, 
when Final Completion can be declared.  
Contracts CH053/54A:  The PMOC remains concerned that costs continue to increase in 
response to continuing delays to the Substantial Completion date.  Although the PMT and the 
contractor had been working on a revised construction schedule that would result in an SC of 
December 31, 2013, it became evident that the date was unrealistic and the parties are no longer 
pursuing completion by then.  Furthermore, the ESA forecast SC date slipped by one month 
since the PMOC’s July 2013 Monthly Report, and is now June 11, 2014 (based on current 
monthly progress rates, the PMOC continues to estimate SC for mid-3Q2014).  In order for the 
ESA PMT to avoid further slippage, the PMOC recommends that ESA place increased priority 
on the Force Account support that it supplies for the CH053/CH054A contractor (Amtrak and 
LIRR supply fixed amounts of support for all ESA contracts.  The ESA PMT is responsible to 
decide how that support is distributed among all its contracts). 
Railroad Force Account:  During August 2013, both LIRR and Amtrak completed all the track 
construction that each had scheduled on Line 4 in Harold Interlocking.  The LIRR reconstructed 
a total of 1,800 LF of track and installed two new turnouts while Amtrak installed a total of 
2,000 LF of Track on Lines 2 and 4 during the special summer track outage.  This work was 
done in close coordination with the CQ031 contractor as it constructed concrete slabs under the 
tracks for the future Westbound Bypass Tunnel.  The work was accomplished on an aggressive 
24/7 construction schedule, it was completed on time, and potentially lays the foundation for 
similar prolonged track outages in future years.  The PMOC recommends that the PMT, the 
railroads, and the contractors continue to work closely with one another so that future project 
tasks can be accomplished in a similar fashion.  
Project Funding/Budget:  The PMOC remains concerned about the results of the CM012R bid 
cancellation and its impact on the project budget.  The PMT has not adjusted its CBB (or 
contingency drawdown) to account for the CM012R bid overrun costs.  The PMOC believes that 
the cost overrun on the cancelled CM012R solicitation will leave the ESA Project with a budget 
shortfall, which will impact the project’s ability to mitigate future cost increases, and may also 
impact the ability to make timely awards of future contract packages.  As of this report the ESA 
PMT continues its monthly financial reporting as if the bid cancellation had not occurred and 
there is no impact to the required budget values.  The President of MTACC stated at the July 
2013 FTA/MTACC Executive Meeting that the budget forecast will not be completed until later 
in 2013; MTACC is waiting for the final cost for the CS179 Contract, which MTACC had 
forecast recommendation to award by September 2013 but will not meet that date; the final 
construction cost estimate for the CM006 Contract; which was provided in August 2013 at 
$361M; and the cost estimate for CM007 (still under development) before providing a forecast.  
August 2013 Monthly Report 
16 
MTACC-ESA 
 
 
The PMOC continues to recommend that ESA include the results of the CM012R bid overrun 
and continuing delays in awarding packages in its official monthly financial forecasting and 
reporting.  The PMT is obligated under the ELPEP agreement to provide accurate budget updates 
and forecasts.  By not doing so, it remains non-compliant with the following requirements set 
forth in the CMP: 
 Cost Estimating Section 5.2 
 Contract Level EAC Forecasting Section 5.3 
 Project Level EAC Forecasting Section 5.4 
 Project Level EAC Forecast Validation Section 5.5  
 Monthly Update Process Section 5.7 
 MTACC Cost Contingency Management and Secondary Mitigation Section 6.1 
Project Schedule:  ESA stated in its June 2013 Quarterly Report that it is currently performing a 
program level re-plan, with a goal of issuing a revised baseline for review by mid-September 
2013 (as stated above).  The PMT is obligated under the ELPEP agreement to provide accurate 
schedule updates and forecasts.  By not doing so, it remains non-compliant with the following 
requirements set forth in the SMP:  
 IPS updating: Section 5.2, requirement for updating IPS on a monthly basis 
 IPS component schedules and monthly update: Section 5.3  
 IPS update process: Section 8.2 documentation 
 Forecasting Requirements: Section 5.4, requires that the PMT identify budget and cash 
flow issues that may impact the project 
 Milestones and RSD slippage recovery process: Section 5.5 
 Schedule Forecasting and Reporting Process; and Schedule Contingency Management: 
Section 6 
The PMOC does not believe that the PMT will be able to provide a viable draft baseline schedule 
in mid-September 2013 given the status of the following items:  
 CM007 “top down” schedule needs to be fleshed out and finalized. 
 Schedules for CM005; CM006; and CM007 need to be inserted into the IPS with proper 
logic ties. 
 Systems Package 1 will not go to the September Board as forecast and, based upon the 
current CM007 top down schedule, ESA may have to re-examine the Systems 
Procurement due to the interfaces with this Contract (as well as the interfaces with 
CM005 and CM006). 
 ESA has not provided procurement dates or durations for any other future packages even 
though these dates need to be integrated into the IPS. 
 ESA is currently re-thinking its packaging strategy and schedule going forward for future 
Harold Contracts that will incorporate lessons learned from previous contracts, regional 
commitments going forward, and available force account resources and outages.  Based 
August 2013 Monthly Report 
17 
MTACC-ESA 
 
 
on discussions with the ESA design group, scope shifts among remaining packages are 
being planned; however, the PMOC has not received any information about the Harold 
re-planning effort.  Consequently, the PMOC does not know where this effort stands. 
Risk Management:  The PMOC remains concerned that the complexity, risk, and coordination 
of the Contract packages associated with the CM012R repackaging will likely prove to be more 
challenging than previously accounted for in MTACC’s internal cost estimate and schedule 
allowance.  To the PMOC’s knowledge, ESA has not fully developed detailed interface 
milestone dates for Contracts CM005, CM006, CM007, CM014B, and CS179.  There are 
approximately 40 milestones among these contracts for which access restraints and interface 
milestones present a major cost and schedule risk. 
The PMOC remains concerned about the timing and results of the Systems Risk Workshop, 
which was held in April 2013.  The MTA Director of the Office of Capital Program Oversight 
stated that he believed the results of that Workshop were of limited value, since interface 
milestones for CM005, CM006 and CM007 were not accurately defined at that point.  One of the 
goals of the Workshop was to provide data that would be useful to aid in progressing 
negotiations on the CS179 Systems Package 1 Contract.  He directed that the risk model be run 
again, with more accurate data.  MTACC initially planned to rerun the model in June 2013, and 
then August 2013 when the June date was missed, however this did not occur.  Given the 
continuing delay in re-running the model, the PMOC does not believe the results will be timely 
enough to be of value in negotiating the CS179 Contract. 
The PMOC is also concerned that the process of the comprehensive internal schedule re-baseline 
and cost estimate evaluation is taking an inordinate amount of time.  As mentioned in the 
Schedule section in this report, the PMOC does not believe that ESA will have a preliminary 
program revised baseline schedule ready by mid-September, and there is no forecast date for a 
new Program Budget.  Given the amount of changes that have occurred in the ESA Program 
since the 2012 baseline cost and schedule were approved, the PMOC believes that the risk profile 
for the entire Program has changed significantly, and recommends that a program-wide Risk 
Assessment be performed right after ESA has a new cost and schedule baseline.
