MONITORING 
1. 
The presence of floating product shall be evaluated in each monitoring well quarterly. If 
detected, the thickness shall be measured to at least 0.01 foot increments. 
2. 
The depth to groundwater in all monitoring wells shall be determined to at least 0.01 foot 
increments quarterly. The results of each quarter's elevation shall be reported in tabular 
form indicating the surveyed elevations of each well reference point, depth to groundwater 
from referencipoint, and the actual groundwater elevation.   he data generated from the 
elevation readings must be referenced to mean sea level. 
3. 
Monitoring wells MW-1, MW-2, MW-3, MW-5, MW-7 MW-8, MW-10, MW-11, MW-22 
shall be sampled quarterly. The analyses shall be performed at a laboratory certified by the 
Department of Health Services. All groundwater samples shall be analyzed for: 
Total petroleum hydrocarbons as diesel 
BTEX 
Parameters measured in the field shall include temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, 
oxidatiodreduction potential and conductivity. 
4. 
All remaining wells and school water supply shall be sampled annually (Third Quarter of 
each year) as described for wells on the quarterly monitoring program. During quarterly 
monitoring, wells on annual monitoring program shall be measured for groundwater 
elevation and dissolved oxygen. 
REPORTING 
Reports shall include: 
groundwater elevation contour maps; 
direction of the groundwater gradient; 
locations of wells monitored; 
constituents and analytical results; 
chain of custody documents showing the: time and date of the sample collected, name 
of the person collecting the samples; 
signed laboratory sheets including quality control data and explanations of analytical 
anomalies, if any. These supporting documents may be included as appendices to the 
report; 
interpretations of the data; 
and a tabular summary of past analytical results.

MONITORING 
1. 
The presence of floating product shall be evaluated in each monitoring well quarterly. If 
detected, the thickness shall be measured to at least 0.01 foot increments. 
2. 
The depth to groundwater in all monitoring wells shall be determined to at least 0.01 foot 
increments quarterly. The results of each quarter's elevation shall be reported in tabular 
form indicating the surveyed elevations of each well reference point, depth to groundwater 
from reference point, and the actual groundwater elevation. The data generated from the 
elevatiori readings must be referenced to mean sea level. 
3. 
All monitoring wells shall be sampled quarterly. The analyses shall be performed at a 
certified laboratory for total petroleum hydrocarbons as diesel, benzene, toluene, 
ethylbenzene and xylene. Parameters measured in the field shall include temperature, 
dissolved oxygen, dissolved carbon dioxide, pH, oxidatiodreduction potential and 
conductivity. 
REPORTING 
Reports shall include groundwater elevation contour maps, direction of the groundwater gradient 
and locations of wells monitored, signed laboratory sheets, interpretations of the data, and a 
tabular summary of past analytical results. Quarterly monitoring reports, including quarterly 
gradient information and quarterly sampling data, shall be submitted to this office in accordance 
with the following schedule:
