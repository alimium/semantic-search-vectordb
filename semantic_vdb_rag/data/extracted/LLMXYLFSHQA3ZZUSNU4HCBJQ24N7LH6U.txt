Guardian states that this filing is

single formula based on a daily index 
price. 
Any person desiring to intervene or to 
protest this filing must file in 
accordance with Rules 211 and 214 of 
the Commission’s Rules of Practice and 
Procedure (18 CFR 385.211 and 
385.214). Protests will be considered by 
the Commission in determining the 
appropriate action to be taken, but will 
not serve to make protestants parties to 
the proceeding. Any person wishing to

appropriate. Such notices, motions, or 
protests must be filed in accordance 
with the provisions of Section 154.210

(Iroquois) filed a motion for an 
extension of time to place tariff sheets 
into effect which were conditionally 
accepted by an unpublished delegated 
letter order issued August 18, 2005. 
Iroquois requests that the tariff sheets 
become effective November 1, 2005 in 
lieu of September 1, 2005. Iroquois 
states that it requires additional time to 
make modifications to its systems that 
are necessary for the implementation of 
Order No. 587–S requirements. Iroquois 
states that because of the complexity of 
the changes, limited number of 
experienced technical personnel and 
lack of availability of key employees, 
additional time is needed. 
Any person desiring to protest the 
requested extension must file in 
accordance with Rule 211 of the 
Commission’s Rules of Practice and 
Procedure (18 CFR 385.211). Protests to 
this filing will be considered by the 
Commission in determining the 
appropriate action to be taken, but will 
not serve to make protestants parties to 
the proceeding. Such protests must be 
filed on or before the date as indicated 
below. Anyone filing a protest must 
serve a copy of that document on the 
applicant. 
The Commission encourages 
electronic submission of protests in lieu 
September 1, 2005.

requested a waiver from the

regulations regarding the adoption of 
the standard generator interconnection 
agreement and procedures promulgated 
in Order No. 2003–C 111 FERC ¶ 61,401 
(2005). 
Any person desiring to intervene or to 
protest this filing must file in 
accordance with Rules 211 and 214 of

Procedure (18 CFR 385.211, 385.214).
