SUMMARY 
H.Res. 1013 resolves that the House of Representatives: 
 
� 
Recognizes the importance of the National School Breakfast Program and its overall positive 
effect on the lives of low-income children and families, as well as its effect on helping to improve 
a child's overall classroom performance; 
 
� 
Expresses support for States that have successfully implemented school breakfast programs in 
order to improve the test scores and grades of its participating students; and 
 
� 
Encourages states to strengthen their school breakfast programs by improving access for 
students, to promote improvements in the nutritional quality of breakfasts served, and to inform 
students and parents of healthy nutritional and lifestyle choices. 
 
BACKGROUND 
The School Breakfast Program (SBP) was established in 1966 under the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 as a 
two-year pilot project designed to provide categorical grants to assist schools serving breakfasts to 
schools located in poor areas or in areas where children had to travel a great distance to school. During 
the first year of operation, the SBP served about 80,000 children at a federal cost of $573,000. 
 
In 2006, over 7.7 million students in the U.S. ate free or reduced-price school breakfasts provided under 
the National School Breakfast Program established by section 4 of the Child Nutrition Act of 1966. 
However, less than half of the low-income students who participate in the National School Lunch Program 
also participate in the school breakfast program.  
 
Studies suggest that eating breakfast closer to classroom and test-taking time improves student 
performance on standardized tests relative to students who skip breakfast or have breakfast at home.
