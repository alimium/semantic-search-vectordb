Each year TVA provides updated
projections of supply and demand to the
TVA sub-region of the Southeastern
Electric Reliability Council (SERC) for
the U.S. Department of Energy’s annual
report EIA–411. The 1999 projection
(latest available) shows expected
baseload demands growing at 2.2
percent from 1999 to 2004. The net
capacity needed to meet the growth in
demand is expected to increase by 3,400
megawatts by year 2003. (See line item
13 on Table—Item 2.1 Projected
Capacity and Demand—Summer of the
EIA–411 report.) The addition of the 100
MW Pickwick Power plant is needed by
TVA to meet this projected regional
power demand for baseload capacity.
Because Energy Vision 2020 identified
and evaluated alternative supply-side
and demand-side energy resources and
technologies for meeting peak and
baseload capacity needs, these
alternatives would not be re-evaluated
in this EIS. Market power purchases was
one supply-side option identified in the
EIS as necessary for meeting TVA’s
baseload and peaking capacity needs.

Indians, the Cherokee Nation of
Oklahoma, the Chickasaw Nation, the
Muscogee (Creek) Nation of Oklahoma,
the Poarch Band of Creek Indians, the
Kialegee Tribal Town, the Alabama-
Quassarte Tribal Town, the
Thlopthlocco Tribal Town, and the
Alabama-Coushatta Tribe. Other
agencies, as appropriate and identified,
will also be included.
After consideration of the scoping
comments, TVA will establish
alternatives and environmental issues to
be addressed in the EIS. Following
analysis of the environmental
consequences of each alternative, TVA
will prepare a draft EIS for public
review and comment. Notice of
availability of the draft EIS will be
published by the Environmental
Protection Agency in the Federal
Register. Copies will be sent to public
libraries, those requesting a copy,
governmental agencies, and Indian
Tribes, and a copy will be placed on
TVA’s Web site at http://www.tva.gov/
environment/reports. TVA will solicit
written comments on the draft EIS, and
information about public meetings to
comment on the draft EIS will be
announced. TVA expects to release a
draft EIS by October 2002 and a final
EIS by January 2003.

OFFICE OF THE UNITED STATES
TRADE REPRESENTATIVE
Determinations Under the African
Growth and Opportunity Act
Proposed Issues To Be Addressed
TVA contemplates that the EIS would
describe the existing environmental and
socioeconomic resources affected by
transportation of the barges to the site,
construction of the balance-of-plant
components on site, and operation of
the power plant. TVA’s evaluation of
environmental impacts to these
resources would include, but not
necessarily be limited to, the potential
impacts on air quality, water quality,
aquatic and terrestrial ecology,
endangered and threatened species,
wetlands, floodplains, aesthetics and
visual resources, noise, land use,
historic and archaeological resources,
and socioeconomic resources.
AGENCY: Office of the United States
Trade Representative.
ACTION: Notice.
Alternatives
At this time, the alternatives TVA has
identified for detailed evaluation
include no action and the proposed
plant at the Hardin County site. During
the scoping process, TVA will
investigate the feasibility of other
alternatives, including technologies and
sites, which meet PPLLC’s purposes and
needs and the basic requirements of
TVA’s electricity needs, are reasonably
capable of being connected to TVA’s
transmission system, and otherwise fall
within the reasonable range of
alternatives to be evaluated in an EIS.
Scoping Process
Scoping, which is integral to the
NEPA process, is a procedure that
SUMMARY: The United States Trade
Representative has determined that
Mozambique has adopted an effective
visa system and related procedures to
prevent unlawful transshipment and the
use of counterfeit documents in
connection with shipments of textile
and apparel articles and has
implemented and follows, or is making
substantial progress toward
implementing and following, the
customs procedures required by the
African Growth and Opportunity Act.
Therefore, imports of eligible products
from Mozambique qualify for the textile
and apparel benefits provided under the
AGOA.
solicits public input to the EIS process
to ensure that: (1) Issues are identified
early and properly studied; (2) issues of
little significance do not consume
substantial time and effort; (3) the draft
EIS is thorough and balanced; and (4)
delays caused by an inadequate EIS are
avoided. TVA’s NEPA procedures
require that the scoping process
commence soon after a decision has
been reached to prepare an EIS in order
to provide an early and open process for
determining the scope and for
identifying the significant issues related
to a proposed action. The scope of
alternatives and issues to be addressed
in the draft EIS will be determined, in
part, from written comments submitted
by mail or e-mail, and comments
presented orally or in writing at public
meetings. The preliminary identification
in this notice of reasonable alternatives
and environmental issues is not meant
to be exhaustive or final.
The scoping process will include both
interagency and public scoping. The
public is invited to submit written
comments or e-mail comments on the
scope of this EIS no later than the date
given under the DATES section of this
notice.
TVA will conduct a public scoping
meeting at the Pickwick Landing State
Park Inn and Conference Center on
March 5, 2002. At the meeting, TVA
management and project staff will
present overviews of the EIS process,
PPLLC staff will present an overview of
the proposed power plant project, and
TVA will answer questions and solicit
comments on the issues that the public
would like addressed in the EIS. This
meeting will be publicized through
notices in local newspapers, TVA press
releases, information on TVA’s Web site
at http://www.tva.gov/environment/
reports, and meetings between TVA
officials and local elected officials
preceding the public meeting.
The federal agencies identified at this
time for inclusion in the interagency
scoping are the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency, U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers (which has agreed to be a
Cooperating Agency in preparation of
the EIS), and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service. State agencies include the
Tennessee Department of Economic and
Community Development, Tennessee
Department of Environment and
Conservation, Tennessee Wildlife
Resources Agency, and the Tennessee
State Historic Preservation Officer.
Regional and local agencies include the
Southwest Tennessee Development
District, Hardin County government,
and the Hardin County Historian. Indian
tribes include the Eastern Band of the
Cherokee Indians, the United

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The
African Growth and Opportunity Act
(Title I of the Trade and Development
Act of 2000, Pub. L. 106–200) (AGOA)
provides preferential tariff treatment for
imports of certain textile and apparel
products of beneficiary sub-Saharan
African countries. The textile and
apparel trade benefits under the AGOA
are available to imports of eligible
products from countries that the
President designates as ‘‘beneficiary
sub-Saharan African countries,’’
provided that these countries (1) have
adopted an effective visa system and
related procedures to prevent unlawful
transshipment and the use of counterfeit
documents, and (2) have implemented
and follow, or are making substantial
progress toward implementing and
following, certain customs procedures
that assist the Customs Service in
verifying the origin of the products.
In Proclamation 7350 (Oct. 2, 2000),
the President designated Mozambique
as a ‘‘beneficiary sub-Saharan African
country.’’ Proclamation 7350 delegated
to the United States Trade
Representative (USTR) the authority to
determine whether designated countries
have met the two requirements
described above. The President directed
the USTR to announce any such
determinations in the Federal Register
and to implement them through
modifications of the Harmonized Tariff
Schedule of the United States (HTS).
Based on actions that Mozambique has
taken, I have determined that
Mozambique has satisfied these two
requirements.
Accordingly, pursuant to the
authority vested in the USTR by
Proclamation 7350, U.S. note 7(a) to
subchapter II of chapter 98 of the HTS
and U.S. note 1 to subchapter XIX of
chapter 98 of the HTS are each modified
by inserting ‘‘Mozambique’’ in
alphabetical sequence in the list of
countries. The foregoing modifications
to the HTS are effective with respect to
articles entered, or withdrawn from
warehouse, for consumption on or after
the effective date of this notice.
Importers claiming preferential tariff
treatment under the AGOA for entries of
textile and apparel articles should
ensure that those entries meet the
applicable visa requirements. See Visa
Requirements Under the African Growth
