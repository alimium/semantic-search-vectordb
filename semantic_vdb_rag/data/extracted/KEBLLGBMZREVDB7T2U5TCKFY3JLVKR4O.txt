Overview  
 
Products tested and certified in the United States to American standards are likely to have to be 
retested and re-certified to E.U. requirements as a result of the E.U.’s different approach to the 
protection of the health and safety of consumers and the environment. Where products are not 
regulated by specific E.U. technical legislation, they are always subject to the E.U.’s General 
Product Safety Directive as well as to possible additional national requirements.  
European Union standards created under the New Approach are harmonized across the 27 
E.U. Member States and European Economic Area countries to allow for the free flow of goods. 
A feature of the New Approach is CE marking. For a list of new approach legislation, go to 
http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/european-standards/documents/harmonised-standards-
legislation/list-references/index_en.htm  
 
While harmonization of E.U. legislation can facilitate access to the E.U. Single Market, 
manufacturers should be aware that regulations and technical standards might also function as 
barriers to trade if U.S. standards are different from those of the European Union.  
Agricultural Standards  
 
The establishment of harmonized E.U. rules and standards in the food sector has been ongoing 
for several decades, but it took until January 2002 for the publication of a general food law 
establishing the general principles of E.U. food law. This Regulation introduced mandatory 
traceability throughout the feed and food chain as of Jan 1, 2005. For specific information on 
agricultural standards, please refer to the Foreign Agricultural Service’s website at: 
http://www.fas.usda.gov/posthome/useu/  
 
There are also export guides to import regulations and standards available on the Foreign 
Agricultural Service’s website: http://www.fas.usda.gov/posthome/useu/  
 
Standards Organizations  
 
The Hellenic Organization for Standardization is ELOT, which elaborates the Hellenic National 
Standards, maintains a central point for testing of materials assesses management systems and 
certifies products and services. Offices and laboratories of ELOT are located in Athens and 
Thessaloniki.  
 
The majority of imported products require the approval of ELOT, thus major end users request 
all certificates, such as UCL, and TUV, in addition to those for fire, environmental and health 
protection, from ELOT. ELOT also accepts appraisal certificates issued by one of the E.U. 
recognized agencies.

STANDARDS AND CONFORMITY ASSESSMENT 
Excerpt from 2010 Country Commercial Guide 
 
E.U. standards setting is a process based on consensus initiated by industry or mandated by 
the European Commission and carried out by independent standards bodies, acting at the 
national, European or international level. There is strong encouragement for non-governmental 
organizations, such as environmental and consumer groups, to actively participate in European 
standardization.  
 
Many standards in the E.U. are adopted from international standards bodies such as the 
International Standards Organization (ISO). The drafting of specific E.U. standards is handled 
by three European standards organizations:  
 
• 
CENELEC, European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization  
(http://www.cenelec.eu/Cenelec/Homepage.htm)  
• 
TSI, European Telecommunications Standards Institute (http://www.etsi.org/)  
• 
CEN, European Committee for Standardization, handling all other standards  
(http://www.cen.eu/cenorm/homepage.htm)  
R
 
Standards are created or modified by experts in Technical Committees or Working Groups. The 
members of CEN and CENELEC are the national standards bodies of the Member States, 
which have "mirror committees" that monitor and participate in ongoing European 
standardization. CEN and CENELEC standards are sold by the individual Member States 
standards bodies. ETSI is different in that it allows direct participation in its technical committees 
from non-E.U. companies that have interests in Europe and gives away its individual standards 
at no charge on its website. In addition to the three standards developing organizations, the 
European Commission plays an important role in standardization through its funding of the 
participation in the standardization process of small- and medium-sized companies and non-
governmental organizations, such as environmental and consumer groups. The Commission 
also provides money to the standards bodies when it mandates standards development to the 
European Standards Organization for harmonized standards that will be linked to E.U. technical 
legislation. Mandates can be checked on line at 
http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/european-standards/standardisation-
requests/index_en.htm  
 
Due to the E.U.’s vigorous promotion of its regulatory and standards system as well as its 
generous funding for its development, the E.U.’s standards regime is wide and deep - extending 
well beyond the E.U.’s political borders to include affiliate members (countries which are hopeful 
of becoming full members in the future) such as Albania, Croatia, FYR of Macedonia, and 
Turkey among others. Another category, called "partner standardization body" includes the 
standards organization of Australia, which is not likely to become a CEN member or affiliate for 
political or geographical reasons. Many other countries are targets of the E.U.’s extensive 
technical assistance program, which is aimed at exporting E.U. standards and technical 
Regulations to developing countries, especially in the Mediterranean and Balkan countries, 
Africa, as well as programs for China and Latin America.

STANDARDS AND CONFORMITY ASSESSMENT

To know what CEN and CENELEC have in the pipeline for future standardization, it is best to 
visit their websites. CEN’s "sectors" page provides an overview by sector and/or technical 
committee whereas CENELEC offers the possibility to search its database. ETSI’s portal 
(http://portal.etsi.org/Portal_Common/home.asp) leads to ongoing activities.  
 
With the need to adapt more quickly to market needs, European standards organizations have 
been looking for "new deliverables" which are standard-like products delivered in a shorter 
timeframe. While few of these "new deliverables" have been linked to E.U. Regulations, 
expectations are that they will eventually serve as the basis for E.U.-wide standards.

Conformity Assessment  
 
Conformity Assessment is a mandatory step for the manufacturer in the process of complying 
with specific E.U. legislation. The purpose of conformity assessment is to ensure consistency of 
compliance during all stages of the production process to facilitate acceptance of the final 
product. E.U. product legislation gives manufacturers some choice with regard to conformity 
assessment, depending on the level of risk involved in the use of their product. These range 
from self-certification, type examination and production quality control system, to full quality 
assurance system. You can find conformity assessment bodies in individual Member State 
country in this list by the European Commission.  
 
Key Link: http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/newapproach/nando/  
 
To promote market acceptance of the final product, there are a number of voluntary conformity 
assessment programs. CEN’s certification systems are the Keymark, the CENCER mark, and 
CEN workshop agreements (CWA) Certification Rules. CENELEC has its own initiative. ETSI 
does not offer conformity assessment services.  
 
Product Certification  
 
To sell products on the E.U. market of 27 Member States as well as Norway, Liechtenstein and 
Iceland, U.S. exporters are required to apply CE marking whenever their product is covered by 
specific product legislation. CE marking product legislation offers manufacturers a number of 
choices and requires decisions to determine which safety/health concerns need to be 
addressed, which conformity assessment module is best suited to the manufacturing process, 
and whether or not to use E.U.-wide harmonized standards. There is no easy way for U.S. 
exporters to understand and go through the process of CE marking, but hopefully this section 
provides some background and clarification.

STANDARDS AND CONFORMITY ASSESSMENT 
Excerpt from 2010 Country Commercial Guide 
 
R
Products manufactured to standards adopted by CEN, CENELEC and ETSI, and published in 
the Official Journal as harmonized standards, are presumed to conform to the requirements of 
E.U. Directives. The manufacturer then applies the CE marking and issues a declaration of 
conformity. With these, the product will be allowed to circulate freely within the E.U. A 
manufacturer can choose not to use the harmonized E.U. standards, but then must demonstrate 
that the product meets the essential safety and performance requirements. Trade barriers occur 
when design, rather than performance, standards are developed by the relevant European 
standardization organization, and when U.S. companies do not have access to the 
standardization process through a European presence.  
 
The CE marking addresses itself primarily to the national control authorities of the Member 
States, and its use simplifies the task of essential market surveillance of regulated products. 
Although CE marking is intended primarily for inspection purposes by Member State inspectors, 
the consumer may well perceive it as a quality mark.  
 
The CE marking is not intended to include detailed technical information on the product, but 
there must be enough information to enable the inspector to trace the product back to the 
manufacturer or the authorized representative established in the E.U. This detailed information 
should not appear next to the CE marking, but rather on the declaration of conformity (which the 
manufacturer or authorized agent must be able to provide at any time, together with the 
product's technical file), or the documents accompanying the product.  
 
Accreditation  
 
Independent certification bodies, known as notified bodies, have been officially accredited by 
competent national authorities to test and certify to E.U. requirements. However, under U.S.-
E.U. Mutual Recognition Agreements (MRAs), notified bodies based in the United States and 
referred to as conformity assessment bodies, are allowed to test in the United States to E.U. 
specifications, and vice versa. The costs are significantly lower which results in U.S. products 
becoming more competitive. At this time, the U.S.-E.U. MRAs cover the following sectors: EMC 
(in force), RTTE (in force), medical devices (in transition), pharmaceutical (on hold), recreational 
craft (in force) and marine equipment (in force). The U.S. Department of Commerce, National 
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), has a link on its website to American and 
European Conformity Assessment bodies operating under a mutual recognition agreement.  
 
Key Link: http://ts.nist.gov/Standards/Global/mra.cfm  
Accreditation is handled at Member State level. "European Accreditation" (http://www.european-
accreditation.org/content/home/home.htm) is an organization representing nationally recognized 
accreditation bodies. Membership is open to nationally recognized accreditation bodies in 
countries in the European geographical area that can demonstrate that they operate an 
accreditation system compatible with EN45003 or ISO/IEC Guide 58.

Publication of Technical Regulations  
 
The Official Journal is the official gazette of the European Union. It is published daily on the 
internet and consists of two series covering draft and adopted legislation as well as case law, 
studies by committees, and more (http://eur-lex.europa.eu/JOIndex.do). It lists the standards 
reference numbers linked to legislation (http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/european-
standards/documents/harmonised-standards-legislation/list-references/index_en.htm). National 
technical Regulations are published on the Commission’s website 
http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/tris/index_en.htm to allow other countries and interested parties to 
comment.  
 
Member countries of the World Trade Organization (WTO) are required under the Agreement on 
Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) Agreement to report to the WTO all proposed technical 
regulations that could affect trade with other member countries. Notify U.S. is a free, web-based 
e-mail subscription service that offers an opportunity to review and comment on proposed 
foreign technical regulations that can affect access to international markets. Register online at

Labeling and Marking  
 
Manufacturers should be mindful that, in addition to the E.U.’s mandatory and voluntary 
schemes, national voluntary labeling schemes might still apply. These schemes may be highly 
appreciated by consumers, and thus, become unavoidable for marketing purposes.  
Manufacturers are advised to take note that all labels require metric units although dual labeling 
is also acceptable. The use of language on labels has been the subject of a Commission 
Communication, which encourages multilingual information, while preserving the right of 
Member States to require the use of language of the country of consumption.  
The E.U. has mandated that certain products be sold in standardized quantities. Council 
Directive 2007/45/EC, harmonizes packaging of wine and spirits throughout the E.U. Existing 
national sizes will be abolished with a few exceptions for domestic producers.

The Eco-label  
 
The E.U. eco-label is a voluntary label which US exporters can display on products that meet 
high standards of environmental awareness. The eco-label is intended to be a marketing tool to 
encourage consumers to purchase environmentally-friendly products. The criteria for displaying 
the eco-label are strict, covering the entire lifespan of the product from manufacture, to use, to 
disposal. These criteria are reviewed every three to five years to take into account advances in 
manufacturing procedures. There are currently twenty-three different product groups, and 
approximately 250 licenses have been awarded for several hundred products.

Applications to display the eco-label should be directed to the competency body of the member 
state in which the product is sold. The application fee will be somewhere between €300 and 
€1300 depending on the tests required to verify if the product is eligible. The eco-label also 
carries an annual fee equal to 0.15 percent of the annual volume of sales of the product range 
within the European community. However, the minimum annual fee is currently set at €500 and 
maximum €25,000.  
 
There are plans to significantly reform the eco-label in the near future, reducing the application 
and annual fees and expanding the product ranges significantly. It is also possible that future 
eligibility criteria may take into account carbon emissions.
