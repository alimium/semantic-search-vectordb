EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This report details the 2002 results from an ongoing project to monitor the
migration behavior of wild spring/summer chinook salmon smolts in the Snake River
Basin.  The report also discusses trends in the cumulative data collected for this project
from Oregon and Idaho streams since 1989.
The project was initiated after detection data from passive-integrated-transponder
tags (PIT tags) had shown distinct differences in migration patterns between wild and
hatchery fish for three consecutive years.  National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS)
investigators first observed these differences in 1989.  The data originated from tagging
and interrogation operations begun in 1988 to evaluate smolt transportation for the U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers.  
In 1991, the Bonneville Power Administration began a cooperative effort with
NMFS to expand tagging and interrogation of wild fish.  Project goals were to
characterize the outmigration timing of these fish, to determine whether consistent
migration patterns would emerge, and to investigate the influence of environmental
factors on the timing and distribution of these migrations.
In 1992, the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) began an
independent program of PIT tagging wild chinook salmon parr in the Grande Ronde and
Imnaha River Basins in northeast Oregon.  Since then, ODFW has reported all tagging,
detection, and timing information on fish from these streams.  However, with ODFW
concurrence, NMFS will continue to report arrival timing of these fish at Lower Granite
Dam.
We continued to tag fish from Idaho after 1992.  Principal results from our
tagging and interrogation during 2001-2002 are listed below:
1)
In July and August 2001, we PIT tagged and released 10,242 wild chinook
salmon parr in 11 Idaho streams.
2)
Average overall observed mortality from collection, handling, tagging, and after a
24-hour holding period was 1.6%.  
3)
Using the detection probability expansion method, estimated parr-to-smolt
survival to Lower Granite Dam for Idaho and Oregon streams averaged 14.3%
(range 6.6-38.1% depending on stream of origin). 
4)
Length and weights were taken on 483 recaptured fish from 11 Idaho streams at
Little Goose Dam in 2002.  Fish had grown an average of 39.7 mm in length and
9.0 g in weight over an average of 275 days.  Their mean condition factor
declined from 1.28 at release (parr) to 1.00 at recapture (smolt).
5)
Larger fish at release were detected at a significantly higher rate the following
spring and summer than their smaller cohorts (P <0.001).
6)
Fish that migrated through Lower Granite Dam in April and May were
significantly larger at release than fish that migrated after May (P = 0.0007).  
7)
In 2002, the peak detections at Lower Granite Dam of parr tagged during the late
summer in 2001 (from the 11 streams in Idaho and 4 streams in Oregon) occurred
during moderate flows of 86.7 kcfs on 4 May.  The 50th and 90th percentile
passage occurred on 3 and 29 May, respectively.  
The estimated parr-to-smolt survivals (revised) from streams of origin from Idaho
and Oregon combined to Lower Granite Dam from 1993 to 2002 are:

Over these years, the parr-to-smolt survival estimates for individual populations
have  varied widely, ranging from 6.0% for South Fork Salmon River in 1996 to 47.6%
for Elk Creek in 1998.  Annual arrival timing of individual stocks at Lower Granite Dam
provides the basis to determine similarities or differences in migration patterns between
years or between stocks.  This report details our findings on the arrival timing
distributions for individual stocks in 2002, as well as arrival timing patterns for several
stocks over the years.
We have observed a 2- to 3-week shift in timing of combined wild stocks passing
Lower Granite Dam between relatively warm and relatively cold years.  In the warm
years of 1990, 1992, 1994, 1998, and 2001 the median passage date at the dam was
between 29 April and 9 May, and the 90th percentile of all wild fish passed by the end of
May.  In the cold years of 1989, 1991, and 1993, median passage did not occur until
mid-May, and the 90th percentile had not passed until mid-June (except during high
flows in 1993, when the 90th percentile passed by the end of May).  In both 1992 and
2001, we experienced near record low flows in the Snake River.  The overall migration
timing patterns of wild fish at the dam were similar in these two years; however, the
timing in 1992 was earlier than 2001 due to the very warm spring in 1992. 
 
iv
In 1995, weather conditions in late winter and early spring were moderate
compared to those of the previous six years, and we observed intermediate passage
timing at the dam relative to previous study years, with the median and 90th percentile
passage occurring on 9 May and 5 June, respectively.  In 1996 and 1997, too few Idaho
fish were detected to make meaningful comparisons of timing with other years.  
In 1999, we experienced different climatic conditions than in all previous
migration years.  In late winter, a near-record snow pack in the Snake River Basin
resulted in high flows during the early spring period (late March); however, the ensuing
flows were moderated by very dry and cold conditions during mid-to-late spring and
early summer.  The fluctuating medium-to-high flows throughout the spring moved wild
fish through Lower Granite Dam as observed in warmer years, with the 50th percentile
passing by 3 May and the 90th by 28 May.  
In 2000, we had more typical temperatures and climatic conditions throughout the
spring, along with slightly below-normal flows, with the highest flows occurring in April. 
Consequently, we observed a wild fish migration pattern similar to those seen in warm
years, with the 50th and 90th percentiles passing in early and late May, respectively.  In
2002, the 50th and 90th percentile also passed Lower Granite Dam in early and late May,
respectively.  However, in 2002, we had slightly lower than normal temperatures and
cooler than normal climatic conditions throughout the spring, along with close to normal
flows, with the highest flows occurring in mid-April and late-May.  Therefore, although
our previous observations support the importance of annual climatic conditions
influencing overall migration timing of the stocks at Lower Granite Dam; clearly,
complex interrelationships of several factors drives the annual migrational timing of the
stocks.

INTRODUCTION
Background
In 1988, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) began a cooperative
study with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to mark wild Snake River spring and
summer chinook salmon parr with passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags for
transportation research.  This project continued through mid-1991, with migrating smolts
monitored as they passed Lower Granite, Little Goose, and McNary Dams during spring
and summer 1989-1991 (Matthews et al. 1990, 1992; Achord et al. 1992, 1996b).  
Information from these three years of study demonstrated that the migration
timing of wild stocks through Lower Granite Dam differs among stream of origin and
also differs from the migration timing of hatchery-reared fish.  Migrations of wild spring
chinook salmon were consistently later and more protracted than those of their
hatchery-reared counterparts, and exhibited more variable timing patterns over the three
years.  In contrast, the migrations of wild summer chinook salmon during these same
years were earlier, though also more protracted, than those of their hatchery counterparts.
The present study began in mid-1991, when NMFS and the Bonneville Power
Administration began a cooperative ongoing project to monitor the migrations of wild
chinook salmon smolts (Achord et al.1994; 1995a,b; 1996a; 1997; 1998; 2000; 2001a,b;
2002).
Project Goals
Prior to 1992, decisions on dam operations and use of stored water relied on
recoveries of branded hatchery fish, index counts at traps and dams, and flow patterns at
the dams.  The advent of PIT-tag technology provided the opportunity to precisely track
the smolt migrations of many wild stocks as they pass through the hydroelectric complex
and other monitoring sites on their way to the ocean.  With the availability of the PIT tag,
a more complete approach to these decisions was undertaken starting in 1992 with the
addition of  PIT-tag detections of several wild spring and summer chinook salmon stocks
at Lower Granite Dam.  
Using data from these detections, we initiated development of a database on wild
fish, addressing several goals of the Columbia River Basin Fish and Wildlife Program of
the Pacific Northwest Electric Power Planning Council and Conservation Act
(NWPPC 1980).  Section 304(d) of the program states,  "The monitoring program will
provide information on the migrational characteristics of the various stocks of salmon
and steelhead within the Columbia Basin."  Further, Section 201(b) urges conservation of
genetic diversity, which will be possible only if wild stocks are preserved.  More
recently, Section 5.9A.1 of  the 1994 Fish and Wildlife Program states that field
monitoring of smolt movement will be used to determine the best timing for water
storage releases and Section 5.8A.8 states that continued research is needed on survival
of juvenile wild fish before they reach the first dam with special attention to water
quantity, quality, and several other factors.  
In addition to addressing several sections of these Fish and Wildlife Programs,
our research also addresses some of the “Reasonable and Prudent Alternatives (RPAs)”
in the 2000 NMFS Biological Opinion (NMFS 2001).  Section 9.6.5.2, Action 180
advocates a regional monitoring effort on the population status of wild fish stocks and the
environmental status of their natal streams and tributaries.  Section 9.6.5.5, Action 199
further states that “the required research/monitoring activities will provide data and
information necessary to develop annual management strategies to help mitigate
hydropower system impacts and to answer important questions related to system
operations.”  Appendix H Research Action 1193 calls for “...research to produce
information on the migrational characteristics of Columbia and Snake River basin salmon
and steelhead.”  The smolt monitoring program produces information on the migrational
characteristics of various salmon and steelhead stocks...and provides management
information for implementing flow and spill measures designed to improve passage
conditions in the mainstem lower Snake and Columbia Rivers.”  
In 2001-2002, we also continued to collect environmental data for the Baseline
Environmental Monitoring Program, which was developed from 1993 to 1997.  The
project collects data to be used in conjunction with the data on parr and smolt movements
to discern patterns or characteristic relationships between these movements and the
environmental factors.
The goals of this ongoing study are 1) to characterize the migration timing and
estimate parr-to-smolt survival of different stocks of wild Snake River spring/summer
chinook salmon smolts at Lower Granite Dam, 2) to determine whether consistent
migration patterns are apparent, and  3) to determine what environmental factors
influence these patterns.
This report provides information on PIT tagging of wild chinook salmon parr in
2001 and the subsequent monitoring of these fish.  Fish were monitored as they migrated
through juvenile migrant traps in 2001 and 2002 as well as through interrogation systems
at Lower Granite, Little Goose, Lower Monumental, McNary, John Day, and Bonneville
Dams during 2002.
In addition, data from environmental monitoring in 2001-2002 are reported here.
These data consist of water temperature, dissolved oxygen, specific conductance,
turbidity, water depth, and pH measured at five monitoring stations in the Salmon River
Basin, Idaho.

METHODS
Fish Collection and Tagging
In 1992, Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) began PIT tagging
wild chinook salmon parr in the Grande Ronde and Imnaha River drainages in northeast
Oregon.  All tagging, detection, and timing information for fish from these streams in
2001-2002 will be reported by ODFW.  However, with ODFW's concurrence, NMFS will
continue to report the timing at Lower Granite Dam of summer-tagged fish from these
Oregon streams.  
Collection and PIT-tagging procedures described by Matthews et al. (1990) and
Achord et al. (1994; 1995a,b) were used for our field work in 2001.  To further alleviate
stress associated with the collection and PIT-tagging operations, we used medical grade
oxygen in temporary holding containers during seining and electrofishing operations and
in the carboys during transport of fish to the tagging site.  We also supplied oxygen to all
containers at the tagging site during tagging operations.
Recaptures at Dams
While collecting and PIT tagging fish at the dams for various studies, NMFS and
other personnel occasionally encounter wild fish that are already PIT tagged.  In such
cases, biological data from these fish are collected, although very few such fish are
handled in this manner at the dams.  However, in 2001, NMFS began a concerted effort
to gather parr-to-smolt growth information on these previously PIT-tagged wild fish from
the various streams.  In 2002, we continued this work.
We utilized the PIT-tag separation-by-code system (Downing et al. 2001) at Little
Goose Dam to collect this information.  A maximum of 100 wild fish from each stream
was programmed for separation at this dam for length and weight measurements.  All fish
that were separated at the dam were handled using water-to-water transfers and other best
handling practices.  After handling, all tagged and untagged fish were returned to the
bypass system for release below the dam.
In addition to length and weight measurements on these wild smolts at Little
Goose Dam, a Fulton-type condition factor (CF) was calculated as  
weight (g)
CF = 
× 105
length (mm)3
Condition factors were calculated for these fish both at release and recapture.  
3
Juvenile Migrant Traps
During fall 2001 and spring 2002,  juvenile migrant fish traps were operated at
Knox Bridge on the South Fork of the Salmon River, on the South Fork of the Salmon
River below its confluence with the Secesh River, on Lake Creek, near Chinook
Campground on the Secesh River, on Marsh Creek, and near the Sawtooth Hatchery on
the upper Salmon River (Figure 1).  Also during spring 2002, juvenile migrant fish traps
were operated on the lower Salmon River near Whitebird, Idaho, and on the Snake River
at Lewiston, Idaho (Figure 1).  Traps were operated by the Nez Perce Tribe and the Idaho
Department of Fish and Game. 
Generally, handling procedures for fish at these traps involve anesthetizing the
fish and scanning for PIT tags followed by length and weight measurements.  Upon
recovery, all fish are released back to the streams or rivers.
Interrogation at Dams
During spring and summer 2002, surviving chinook salmon PIT tagged for this
study migrated volitionally downstream through hydroelectric dams on the Snake and
Columbia Rivers.  Of the eight dams the smolts passed, the following six were equipped
with smolt collection and/or PIT-tag interrogation systems:  Lower Granite (Figure 1),
Little Goose, and Lower Monumental Dams on the Snake River, and McNary, John Day,
and Bonneville Dams on the Columbia River.  
At these six dams, all smolts guided from turbine intakes into juvenile bypass
systems were electronically monitored for PIT tags.  The PIT-tag interrogation systems
were the same as those described by Prentice et al. (1990).  Dates and times to the nearest
second were automatically recorded on a computer as PIT-tagged fish passed each
detector.  Detection data were transferred once daily to the mainframe computer operated
by the Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission in Portland, Oregon.
Migration Timing
During the years from 1993 to 1997, migration timing at each interrogation dam
was analyzed based on first-time detection numbers expanded relative to the proportion
of daily spill (Achord et al. 1995a,b; 1996b; 1997; 1998).  This produced a spill-adjusted
or indexed number of PIT-tagged fish passing each dam daily for individual or combined
populations.  Since 1998, within-season migration timing at Lower Granite Dam has been
based on daily detection numbers (of all wild PIT-tagged chinook salmon smolts)
expanded relative to estimated daily detection probabilities.

Figure 1.  Wild spring/summer chinook salmon parr were PIT tagged during 2001 in the
following streams:  1−Bear Valley Creek, 2−Elk Creek, 3−Marsh Creek,       
4−Valley Creek, 5−Herd Creek, 6−South Fork Salmon River, 7−Big Creek
(lower), 8−Rush Creek, 9−West Fork Chamberlain Creek, 10−Secesh River,
and 11−Lake Creek.  Juvenile migrant fish traps shown above are as follows: 
A−Lake Creek, B−Secesh River, C−South Fork Salmon River, D−Lower South
Fork Salmon River, E−Marsh Creek, F−Sawtooth, G−East Fork Salmon River,
H−Salmon River, and I−Snake River.  
5
Detection probabilities were calculated using the methods of Sandford and Smith
(2002) to provide an estimate of the number of PIT-tagged wild spring/summer chinook
salmon smolts that passed the dam each day.  At interrogation dams below Lower
Granite Dam, first-time detections were not expanded per above procedures.  
Migration timing at Lower Granite Dam was calculated by totaling the
(expanded) number of detections in 3-day intervals and dividing by total detections
during the season.  This method was applied to detection data for fish from individual
and combined streams. 
There was no straightforward way to compare within-season passage timing dates
among stocks from different streams to discern statistically significant differences in
arrival timing at Lower Granite Dam.  Therefore, we used an approach analogous to
analysis of variance with multiple comparisons between the 10th, 50th (median), and
90th percentile passage dates at the dam.  Bootstrap methods were used to calculate
estimates of the standard error for each statistic (Efron and Tibshirani 1993).  A
“representative” estimate of variance for each statistic was then calculated as the median
of the standard errors for all 13 streams.  The Student-Newmann-Keuls (SNK) multiple
comparison method (α = 0.05) was used to make comparisons between streams for each
statistic (Petersen 1985).
We also examined the migration timing at Lower Granite Dam of individual
stocks over a period of years to determine similarities or differences between years and
between stocks.  We chose stocks with nine or more years of timing data for these
analyses.  Comparisons of the 10th, 50th, and 90th percentile passage dates were made
among 10 streams using a two-factor analysis of variance (ANOVA). Year was
considered a random factor and stream a fixed factor.  Residuals were visually examined
to assess normality.  Treatment means were compared using Fisher’s least significant
difference procedure (Petersen 1985).  
Environmental Information
Environmental data were collected from monitoring systems at the following
locations:  1) in Marsh Creek, 2) in Valley Creek, 3) near Sawtooth Hatchery in the upper
Salmon River, 4) in the South Fork of the Salmon River by Knox Bridge, and 5) near the
Chinook Campground in the Secesh River.  All monitoring systems except the system at
Valley Creek were close to juvenile migrant fish traps.

RESULTS
Fish Collection and Tagging
From 25 July to 27 August 2001, we collected 11,180 wild chinook salmon parr
in 11 Idaho streams (Figure 1) over a distance of about 33 stream kilometers and
approximately 298,923 m2 (Table 1; Appendix Table 1).  Of these fish, 10,242 were PIT
tagged and released back into the streams; the remainder were not tagged because of size,
injury, or precocious maturation or because they were collected for genetic studies or
were extra collected fish.  Numbers released per stream ranged from 14 in Rush Creek to
1,534 in the South Fork of the Salmon River (Table 1 and Appendix Tables 1 and 2). 
Fork lengths of all collected chinook salmon parr ranged from 43 to 176 mm (mean
66.5 mm) and weights ranged from 1.0 to 45.4 g (mean 4.0 g).  Fork lengths of tagged
and released chinook salmon parr ranged from 51 to 176 mm (mean 67.1 mm) and
weights ranged from 1.3 to 12.7 g (mean 4.0 g) (Appendix Table 1). 
Other than chinook salmon parr, sculpin were the most abundant species observed
during collection operations (Table 2).  However, the records of these observations do
not represent total abundances of fish in the areas of collection, as we targeted collecting
chinook salmon not coincident species.  
Mortality associated with collection and tagging procedures was low, and 24-hour
tag loss was zero (Table 3; Appendix Table 3).  Average collection mortality was 1.5%,
and average tagging and 24-hour delayed mortality was 0.1%.  The average overall
observed mortality was 1.6%.
Recaptures at Dams
From 20 April to 28 June 2002, 484 PIT-tagged wild fish from Idaho streams
were recaptured in the separation-by-code system at the Little Goose Dam juvenile fish
facility  (Table 4).  We gathered parr-to-smolt growth information on 483 of these fish. 
Between tagging in 2001 and recapture in 2002, overall mean length increased by
39.7 mm (range 13-106 mm) and overall mean weight increased by 9.0 g (range
1.3-18.5 g), over a mean recapture interval of 275 days (range 238-335 days).  Average
growth rates in length between tagging and recapture ranged from 0.13 to 0.16 mm/day
and weight gain averaged from 0.030 to 0.034 g/day for fish from these 11 streams.  The
mean condition factor decreased from 1.28 at release (parr) to 1.00 at recapture (smolt)
for these wild fish. 
Of the 10 other PIT-tagged wild fish recaptured and handled at the dams, only 4
were measured and 1 was weighed (Table 4).

Recaptures at Traps
A total of 522 wild fish PIT-tagged in summer 2001 were recaptured above
Lower Granite Dam from summer-fall 2001 to summer 2002 (Table 4).  Of these, 510
were recaptured in summer-fall 2001 and 12 were recaptured in spring-summer 2002. 
For the 79 fish recaptured at the South Fork Salmon River trap at Knox Bridge in
summer-fall 2001, the fish had grown an average of 0.05 mm/day in length and lost
0.02 g/day in weight between release in natal rearing areas and recapture at the trap
(Table 4).  In spring 2002, the five fish recaptured at this trap had grown an average of
0.05 mm/day in length and gained 0.003 g/day in weight between release in summer
2001 and recapture in spring 2002.
The trap on lower South Fork of the Salmon River recaptured 18 of the
summer-tagged upstream released fish in summer-fall 2001 and 1 was recaptured at this
trap in spring 2002 (Table 4).  The 18 recaptured fish in the fall had grown an average of
0.07 mm/day in length and lost an average of 0.002 g/day in weight between release and
recapture.  The spring recaptured fish had grown 0.05 mm/day in length and 0.007 g/day
in weight over a 244-day period (over-winter).
The trap on the Secesh River recaptured 103 of the summer-tagged fish in
summer-fall 2001 and 1 was recaptured at this trap in spring 2002 (Table 4).  The
103 recaptured fish in the fall had grown an average of 0.13 mm/day in length and lost an
average of 0.01 g/day in weight between release and recapture.  Fish recaptured in the
spring had grown 0.10 mm/day in length over a 349-day period.
The trap on Lake Creek recaptured 198 of the summer-tagged fish in summer-fall
2001 and none were recaptured at this trap in spring 2002 (Table 4).  The 198 recaptured
fish had grown an average of 0.13 mm/day in length and lost an average of 0.02 g/day in
weight between release and recapture.
The Marsh Creek trap recaptured 112 summer-tagged fish in summer-fall 2001
and 5 summer-tagged fish were recaptured at this trap during spring 2002 (Table 4).  The
112 recaptured fish in summer-fall had grown an average of 0.11 mm/day in length and
lost an average of 0.002 g/day in weight between release and recapture.  The five
recaptured fish in spring-summer 2002, had grown an average of 0.11 mm/day in length. 
Only one of these five fish was weighed, and it had gained 0.014 g/day over 250 days. 
Detections at Dams
Based on expanded detections (1,382 fish) at Lower Granite Dam from 11 April
to 5 July 2002, estimated survival from parr to smolt for Idaho fish averaged 13.5%
(range 8.5-38.1%; Table 5; Appendix Tables 4-14; Herd Creek omitted from analysis). 
An additional 750 first-time detections (unadjusted) were recorded at Little Goose,

salmon smolts from Idaho at six dams from April to August 2002.  Expanded
detections at Lower Granite Dam provide estimates of parr to smolt survival.

Lower Monumental, McNary, John Day, and Bonneville Dams (Table 5; Appendix
Tables 4-13 and 15-19).  By comparing all first-time detections at interrogation dams
(1,055) to the expanded number of detections at Lower Granite Dam (1,382), we
estimated that 23.7% of the wild fish from Idaho passed through the hydropower system
undetected.  
For parr tagged in Idaho, average fork length at release was 67.1 mm (Appendix
Table 1).  However, of fish from this group that were detected the following spring at the
dams, average fork length at release was 70.2 mm.  These length differences were
significant (P <0.01).  The release-length distribution of detected fish was also
significantly different from that of released fish in all length categories except 65-69 mm
(P <0.023; Figure 2).  
We also found a significant difference in fork lengths at time of release for fish
that migrated through Lower Granite Dam in April and May compared to fish that
migrated after May (P <0.01).  Fish migrating through the dam in April and May were on
average 4.3 mm larger when released than fish migrating after May.  These data suggest
that fish size may influence migration timing or overwintering location with respect to
detection at the first dam. 
Migration Timing
Lower Granite Dam
Migration timing at Lower Granite Dam varied for fish from the 13 Idaho and
Oregon streams (Figure 3).  In comparisons among these streams (Herd Creek was
omitted and lower Big Creek was combined with Rush Creek; Tables 6a-6b), fish from
the Lostine River had a significantly earlier timing for 10th percentile passage than fish
from all the other streams except the Secesh River (P <0.05).  The overall 10th percentile
passage distributions for fish from all 13 streams ranged from 11 April to 26 April
(Tables 6a-6b).
Fish from the Secesh River had a significantly earlier 50th percentile passage date
at the dam than all other Idaho and Oregon streams except the Lostine River (P <0.05). 
The overall 50th percentile passage distributions for fish from all 13 streams ranged from
21 April to 20 May (Tables 6a-6b).  Fish from Big Creek (lower)/Rush Creek had
significantly earlier 90th percentile passage date at the dam than fish from all other
streams except the Lostine River, Secesh River, and the Imnaha River (P <0.05).  The
overall 90th percentile passage distributions for fish from all 13 streams ranged from
7 May to 18 June (Tables 6a-6b).

Figure 2.  Percent by fork length increments, of PIT-tagged wild spring/summer chinook 
salmon parr released in Idaho streams in 2001 (n = 10,226) and percent of fish 
detected for these length increments at dams in spring and summer 2002         
(n = 1,000).

Passage distributions of the middle 80% were of significantly shorter duration
(22 days) for fish from Big Creek (lower)/Rush Creek than for fish from the Secesh
River, Marsh Creek, South Fork Salmon River, Valley Creek, Bear Valley Creek, Elk
Creek, Lake Creek, and Catherine Creek (34-55 days; P <0.05) (Tables 6a-6b).  The
middle 80% passage distributions for fish from the other four streams ranged from 24 to
33 days.  
Comparison with Flows
We combined all first-time detections (expanded) at Lower Granite Dam of wild
fish from Idaho streams and compared the timing with river flows and spill during the
same periods (Figure 4 and Appendix Table 14).  Overall, passage occurred between
early April and early July, with the middle 80% of wild fish passing from mid-April to
late May (Table 7).  The peak passage dates were 25 April and 4 May which coincided
with low to moderate flows of 62.4 and 86.7 kcfs, respectively (Appendix Table 14). 
However, when we combined the first-time detections (expanded) from all Idaho and
Oregon streams, peak detections coincided with moderate-to-high flows of 112.2 kcfs on
16 April and 4 May under moderate flows of 86.7 kcfs (Figure 5). 
Environmental Information
In 2001-2002, we collected hourly measurements of temperature, dissolved
oxygen, specific conductance, turbidity, water depth, and pH from five environmental
monitoring stations in the Salmon River Basin.  We recorded these data, as well as data
from previous years, in the Baseline Environmental Monitoring Program database
(Perkins 1998).  
Environmental data collected during 2001-2002 are presented in Appendix
Figures 1-6, which compare various water quality parameters to chinook salmon fry,
parr, and smolt movements through adjacent traps (Figure 1) in 2001-2002.  Appendix
Tables 20-24 provide a summary of environmental information collected from the five
environmental monitoring sites (Marsh Creek, Valley Creek, Sawtooth Hatchery, Knox
Bridge, and Secesh River) from August 2001 to July 2002.

DISCUSSION
Mortality rates associated with collection and tagging in 2001 were comparable to
those in earlier years (Achord et al. 1992; 1994; 1995a,b; 1996a,b; 1997; 1998; 2000;
2001a,b; 2002).
Overall mean length and weight gains from parr-to-smolt for wild fish from Idaho
streams as measured at Little Goose Dam in 2002 were 39.7 mm in length and 9.0 g in
weight over an average recapture interval of 275 days.  Thus the mean growth rate was
0.14 mm/day and 0.033 g/day.  This growth rate was less than that observed at Little
Goose Dam in 2001, when mean growth rates were 0.16 mm/day and 0.042 g/day for
wild fish from many of the same streams (Achord et al. 2002).  The higher densities of
parr in the streams in summer 2001 compared to summer 2000, and a much cooler spring
in 2002 than 2001, may have contributed to the reduced growth of wild fish observed in
2002 compared to 2001.
The average time between tagging and recapture for fish captured at the South
Fork Salmon River Knox Bridge trap in summer-fall 1998, 1999, 2000, and 2001 was 19,
22, 32, and 27 days, respectively.  The average length gain over these time frames was
2.9, 2.0, 3.8, and 1.4 mm, respectively.  Thus, growth rates averaged from 0.05 to
0.15 mm/day for these fish over the four years.  This information shows that growth rates
of wild fish from the South Fork Salmon River in late summer and fall were quite
variable over these four years.  However, these growth rates follow a parr
density-dependent trend, with lower growth rates of parr in higher-density years.  Similar
analyses for wild fish recaptured at the other traps will be performed as more data are
collected and analyzed.  
Yearly, overall parr-to-smolt survival estimates (revised) for the wild stocks from
Idaho and Oregon streams to Lower Granite Dam were as follows:

Parr-to-smolt survival estimates for the individual populations have been quite
variable over these years ranging from 6.0% for South Fork of the Salmon River fish in
1996 to 47.6% for Elk Creek fish in 1998.  The higher parr densities observed in natal
rearing areas in summer 2001 may have contributed to the lower parr-to-smolt survival
estimates to Lower Granite Dam in 2002 than in the last several years (Achord et al.
2003).  Another high parr density year, 1994, also produced an overall low parr-to-smolt
survival estimate in 1995 (13.5%).
Length-distribution curves for data collected over the last 14 years have generally
shown that wild fish released and subsequently detected at dams are slightly larger at
release than fish released but not detected.  The reason for this difference in detection
rates is unknown, but we speculated that larger fish survived better than smaller fish.  
However, Zabel and Achord (in review) compared length, weight, and condition index
for these stocks to parr-to-smolt survival over a 5-year period and found that mean
population length and weight were not related to survival.  However, year and site effects
were detected.  Consistent patterns across years of selection for length and weight were
found, but condition factor was selectively neutral.  These results imply that the relative
size of individuals within populations was important, but the average size of a population
was not, at least in terms of performance during the juvenile life stage.
Another consistent trend that has emerged over the years is the difference in
arrival timing at Lower Granite Dam with respect to size at release.  In 2002, we again
observed that wild fish detected at the dam in April and May had been significantly
larger at release than fish migrating after May.  This suggests that size is an important
factor related to either the initiation of smoltification or to other life-history dynamics
that affect the migration timing of wild fish.
Relationships with Flow
In 2002, peak detections of wild fish at Lower Granite Dam from 13 Idaho and
Oregon streams coincided with moderate-to-high flows of 112.2 kcfs on 16 April (Figure
5).  Detections peaked again on 4 May under moderate flows of 86.7 kcfs.  As observed
at Lower Granite Dam from 1989 through 2001, peak detections of wild spring/summer
chinook salmon smolts from Idaho and Oregon were highly variable and generally
independent of river flows before about 9 May.  However, in every year except 2000 and
2002, peak detections of wild fish from 9 to 31 May coincided with periods of peak flow. 
Raymond (1979) showed that peaks in migration for the composite population of spring
and summer chinook salmon smolts (mostly wild) passing Ice Harbor Dam from 1964 to
1969 preceded periods of maximum river discharge in most years.  During these years,
fish passage peaked between 26 April and 13 May.  With respect to river flows, our
observations matched those of Raymond for wild fish migrating before mid-May.  
34
Climatic Influence
Annual overall climatic variation was thought to be an important factor
controlling the overall migrational timing and passage dynamics of wild spring/summer
chinook salmon smolts at Lower Granite Dam.  In the warm years of 1990, 1992, 1994,
1998, and 2001, the median passage date at the dam was between 29 April and 9 May,
and the 90th percentile of all wild fish passed by the end of May.  In the cold years of
1989, 1991, and 1993, median passage did not occur until mid-May, and the 90th
percentile had not passed until mid-June (except during high flows in 1993, when the
90th percentile passed by the end of May).
Within these 8 years, we saw a consistent 2- to 3-week shift in timing of wild fish
at the dam between relatively warm and relatively cold years.  In 1995, intermediate
weather conditions prevailed in late winter and early spring (compared to the previous
six years), and we observed intermediate passage times of 9 May and 5 June for the 50th
and 90th percentile passage dates, respectively, for these combined wild populations.  
In 1999, we experienced different climatic conditions than in all previous
migration years.  In late winter, a near-record snow pack in the Snake River Basin
resulted in high flows early in the migration period (during late March); however, the
ensuing flows were moderated by very dry and cold conditions during the remaining
spring and early summer.  Fluctuating, medium-to-high flows throughout the spring
moved the wild fish through Lower Granite Dam as observed in warmer years, with the
50th percentile passing by 3 May and the 90th by 28 May (Achord et al. 2001a).  Flows
during 2000 were slightly below normal, with highest flows occurring in April, along
with more seasonal temperatures and climatic conditions throughout the spring.  
Consequently, we observed a wild fish migration pattern similar to a warm year, with
50th percentile passing by 6 May and the 90th by 29 May.
In 2002, the 50th and 90th percentiles of wild fish also passed Lower Granite
Dam in early and late May, respectively.  However, in 2002, we had slightly lower than
normal temperatures and cooler than normal conditions throughout the spring, along with
close to normal flows, with the highest flows occurring in mid-April and late-May. 
Therefore, although our previous observations support the importance of annual climatic
conditions influencing overall migration timing of the stocks at Lower Granite Dam,
clearly, complex interrelationships of several factors drives the annual migrational timing
of the stocks.  
The migration timing of individual wild stocks has been highly variable and
usually protracted at Lower Granite Dam.  However, migration-timing patterns emerging
for some stocks range from early to late spring.  Shifts in timing of passage distribution
for these stocks have been less than 1 to 5 weeks over all years, and these shifts appear
related to annual climatic conditions and probably several other factors. 
35
Cumulative Data:  1989-2002
An important objective of this study is to examine the migration timing at Lower
Granite Dam of individual stocks over a period of years to determine similarities or
differences between years and between stocks.  We now have at least nine years of
migration-timing data for fish from 10 of the study streams, and this allowed us to
construct 95% confidence intervals for the 10th, 50th, and 90th percentile passage dates
at Lower Granite Dam for fish from these streams (Table 8). 
Results showed that Secesh River fish had significantly earlier timing of the 10th
percentile passage than fish from Elk Creek, Bear Valley Creek, Marsh Creek, Valley
Creek, or Catherine Creek (P <0.05).  The 10th percentile passage of fish from the Secesh
River was also earlier than those of fish from the Lostine, South Fork of the Salmon, or
Imnaha Rivers or from Lake Creek though the differences were not significant (P >0.05). 
Secesh River fish also had significantly earlier arrival timing at the dam for the 50th
percentile passage than fish from all the other streams except Lake Creek (P <0.05). 
However, for the 90th percentile passage, the Lostine River fish had significantly earlier
timing at the dam than fish from the other streams, except the Imnaha River and Marsh
Creek (P <0.05).  
We also examined the length of time that encompassed passage of the middle
80% as a measure of protracted or compressed timing characteristics for stocks from
individual streams and from wild fish from all these streams combined.  The middle 80%
passage at Lower Granite Dam averaged 42 days (range 29 to 51 days) for fish from
these 10 streams over the years.  The Lostine River, Marsh Creek, Imnaha River, and
Catherine Creek fish had a significantly shorter passage duration (middle 80%) at the
dam (34-38 days) than fish from the Secesh River, South Fork Salmon River, and Lake
Creek (48-50 days; P <0.05).

The Lostine River, Marsh Creek, Imnaha River, and Catherine Creek fish also
had shorter passage durations at the dam than fish from Bear Valley Creek, Elk Creek,
and Valley Creek but the differences were not significant (40-42 days; P >0.05).  
In examining wild chinook salmon smolt passage timing at the dams over the last
14 years, it has become clear that several factors influence passage timing.  Complex
yearly interrelationships between flow and annual climatic conditions are primary factors
contributing to passage timing.  However, water temperature, turbidity, physiological
development, variability in stock behavior, fish size, and other yet unknown factors may
all contribute substantially to wild smolt passage timing at dams.  
As additional environmental monitors and traps are installed in study streams, we
can more accurately monitor fry, parr, and smolt movements out of rearing areas and
examine the relationships between these movements and environmental conditions within
the streams.  Mapped over time, this information, along with weather and climate data,
will provide tools for the accurate prediction of movement in different wild stocks.  Such
tools are vital to recovery planning for threatened or endangered species of Pacific
salmon.  
Action 152 of the RPAs in the 2000 NMFS Biological Opinion encourages
cooperation between government agencies by sharing water quality and biological
monitoring information, project reports, and data from existing programs and from
subbasin or watershed assessment products (NMFS 2001).  During 2002, we encouraged
a cooperative spirit in all future data exchanges with agencies and tribes during ongoing
studies in spawning and rearing areas.  Such cooperation will serve to facilitate planning
for recovery of the wild fish stocks.
