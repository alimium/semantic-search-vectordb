Keep It Clean.
2
Wear clean clothes, scrub your shoes
with disinfectant, and wash your hands
thoroughly before entering your bird
area.  Clean cages and change food and
water daily.  Clean and disinfect equip-
ment that comes in contact with your
birds or their droppings, including cages
and tools.  Remove manure before dis-
infecting.  Properly dispose of dead
birds.
