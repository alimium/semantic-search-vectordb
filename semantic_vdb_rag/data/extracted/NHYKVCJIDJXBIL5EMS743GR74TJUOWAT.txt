 Executive Summary 
Niño 3.4 
Current state of El 
Niño/Southern 
Oscillation (ENSO) 
phenomenon (bottom), 
compared to three 
months ago (top): La 
Niña has made a 
modest comeback last 
month. This includes 
enhanced trade winds 
near the dateline, and 
below-normal SST in 
central tropical 
Pacific, especially just 
west of 120W. 
Here we go again, La 
Niña is coming back for 
an encore performance, 
just like in 2008, 1999, 
1974, 1971, 1955, 1950,… 
ECMWF forecast from May 2011(left):     
Correct anticipation of warm-up through 
June, but missed the reappearance of La 
Niña conditions after that; 
 
A not-yet published paper that has evaluated 
every model over the last decade has 
confirmed that ECMWF is the ‘gold 
standard’ in this business. 
The most recent forecast (right) shows 
moderate La Niña conditions this 
winter, with no chance of El Niño or 
even ENSO-neutral before February 
2012. 
ENSO forecasts from 15 dynamical & 
8 statistical forecast models in June 
2011 (left):     Transition to ENSO-
neutral by early summer (√), then 
 wide open outcome  for rest of 2011; 
On average, dynamical models a bit 
warmer than statistical models, 
insignificant differences overall. 
The most recent forecast collection 
(right) shows a shift towards La Niña, 
although only half of the models reach 
the ‘magic’ -0.5C threshold; meanwhile, 
the latest available PDO-value (July) 
remains negative, having proven itself 
yet again to be consistent with the return 
of La Niña... 
1st vs 2nd Yr La Niña composites for October-December 
Compared to the typical outcome of La Niña fall seasons 
(top left), Oct-Dec 2010 (bottom left) ended up with the 
same preference for wet conditions in western CO, while 
drought conditions were more severe in SE CO than is 
typical for La Niña.   
Autumn 2011 may end up drier than in 2010 for much of 
our state (top right).  This is based on the same set of 
double-dip Las Niñas as presented last October. 
1st vs 2nd Yr La Niña composites for January-March 
Compared to the typical outcome of La Niña winter seasons 
(top left), Jan-Mar ‘11 (bottom left) ended up close to (dry) 
expectations (this does not monitor mountains snowpack), 
especially in SE CO.   
The upcoming winter season shows no signal (top right), 
which may be our ‘opening’ for a possible rebound after a 
dry fall. This is based on same set of double-dip Las Niñas as 
before. 
What can we expect in the next five days? 
Expected precipitation amounts for the next five days, according to Hydrological Prediction 
Center (NOAA-HPC) –sure looks dry for the weekend… 
What can we expect next week and beyond? 
European model shows mid-continent ridging 8-10 days out from last night – keeping us dry 
and mild, while the American model is further along in replacing the ridge with westerly flow. 
What can we expect in the next two weeks? 
Precipitation chances for 4-6, 6-10, and 8-14 
days from today show poor chances for 
precipitation early next week (top); close to 
‘normal’ for next weekend (top right), and back 
to drier than ‘normal’ by “Week 2” (right). 
 
Temperatures are expected to rise above 
normal over the weekend and staying mild 
beyond that, delaying the onset of winter 
snowpack conditions. 
Climate Prediction Center ‘Analog’ Forecasts 
According to yesterday’s soil-moisture analog forecast, wet anomalies are favored in 
northernmost CO along with cooler-than-average temperatures, while drought conditions 
remain anchored towards the Four Corners and northern TX.  Typical skill at this lead-
time (right) is quite high over northeast CO where there is a tilt towards wet conditions.

Climate Prediction Center ‘Analog’ Forecasts 
According to yesterday’s soil-moisture analog forecast, dry conditions threaten eastern CO 
in late winter, while our mountains may look forward to a near-normal winter.  Typical 
skill at this long lead-time (right) is high to our south, maintaining drought conditions from 
eastern NM and most of TX up into SE CO.

Climate Prediction Center Forecasts 
CPC’s Oct-Dec (left) temperature forecast expects a warm fall 
(La Niña+trend), especially in already dry eastern CO. Their 
precipitation forecast (right) keeps it dry for all of us, again, 
consistent with La Niña-based expectations, and some composites 
that I made for 2nd year La Niña conditions.

Climate Prediction Center Forecasts 
CPC’s Jan-Mar ‘12 (left) temperature forecast expects 
Colorado to straddle warm anomalies to the south and cold 
anomalies to the north. A similar picture transpires for 
precipitation (wet to the north, dry to the south), again, 
consistent with La Niña-based expectations (and my composite).

Statistical Forecast for April-June 2011 
February’s (top left), March’s (top middle), and 
April’s (top right) forecasts for April-June 2011 
were fairly confident that southern CO would see 
below-normal moisture.  The northwestern third of 
our state had slightly increased chances of being 
wetter-than-average. 
 
Most of southern CO ended up dry, and northwest 
CO wet (right).  On the other hand, the northeast 
corner of our state was wetter than expected, ditto 
for the Four Corners region.  IOW, the February 
forecast panned out better than later updates (also 
for New Mexico)! 
Statistical Forecast for July-September 2011 
The April forecast for July-September 2011 (left) was 
optimistic for northwestern CO, and undecided for the 
rest of the state.  The June forecast (top right) was 
significantly drier, including my 1st dry summer forecast 
 for the eastern plains in more than one decade.  
As of yesterday (right), dry conditions have indeed 
prevailed in much of eastern CO, especially in the 
Arkansas Valley which was already under drought 
conditions. Early July wetness (plus a couple of storms this 
month) have kept us (FR) wetter than expected.  
Statistical Forecast for Oct-Dec 2011 
My new forecast for October-December 2011 (left) is leaning towards dry conditions over 
southern and eastern CO, leaving the West slope and mountains under climatological odds. 
Verification statistics over the last decade (right) show skill over the dry northeastern plains 
of CO, but not to the west.   
 
Statistical Forecast for January-March 2012 
My new forecast for January-March 2012 (left) is leaning towards dry conditions over 
southeastern CO, again leaving the mountains under climatological odds, and the far 
western valleys and Four-Corners’ region with a slight tilt towards a dry late winter. 
Verification statistics over the last decade (right) show skill for much of the domain, except 
the higher elevations of CO. 
 
Last year (no forecast issued), my forecast for JFM’11 would have been dry for eastern CO, 
and at least near-normal for the mountains. 
Executive Summary (22 September 2011) – klaus.wolter@noaa.gov 
1. 
La Niña appears to be making a come-back, confirming my long-lead statements from 
last October.  It probably will end up weaker than last winter, but that is less 
important for impacts than in the El Niño case. 
 
2.    The last three months did not see much of a flooding season (√), a late run-off season (no 
excessive dust √), and a less severe fire season than feared.  All in all, Colorado did very 
well last Water Year, with (near-)record snowpack conditions coming off in the most 
benign manner possible. 
 
3. 
Along the Front Range, the monsoon season was wetter-than-expected, with a 
particularly wet start in July, but severe dryness in August.  Those rains of early July 
may have involved recycled moisture from our record-snowpack, IMHO.  The next two 
weeks will see a return of dry/mild conditions, with no prospects for snow (or rain) 
before September is over.   
4. 
My forecast for the next six months is not optimistic, especially for southeastern 
Colorado.  Thanks to La Niña, the mountains have a good chance of getting close to 
normal snowfall in mid-winter (to be firmed up in next two months).  A repeat of last 
year’s record-breaking snows is unlikely. 
 
5. 
Bottomline (Double-Dip La Niña): In our state, 2nd year La Niña winter half-years are 
often drier than in the previous year.  There is little evidence that would support a 
contrary (wet) viewpoint.  This statement does not factor in ‘rogue atmospheric river 
events’ (like last December) that are currently not predictable at the seasonal time-scale.
