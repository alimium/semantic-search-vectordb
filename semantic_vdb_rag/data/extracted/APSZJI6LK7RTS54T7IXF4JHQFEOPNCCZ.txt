gang prevention and Community Prosecution/Gun Control efforts. The Anti-Gang Initiative 
funds will enhance PSN task force efforts to combat gangs by building on the effective 
strategies and partnerships developed under PSN.  The Community Prosecution/Gun Control 
projects must target gun crime and violent offenders.  PSN's five essential elements:  
1) partnerships, 2) strategic planning, 3) training, 4) outreach, and 5) accountability. For 
more on these elements, visit www.ncjrs.org/html/bja/205263/ . Additional guidance may be 
found at http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/BJA/psngrants/

Reporting Requirements for Successful Applicants 
 
Fiscal Reports:  A Fiscal Report of grant expenditures is required monthly whether or not 
there were expenditures for the grant.  The report is due by the 15th of each month.  
Failure to submit monthly fiscal reports will prevent reimbursement of grant expenses and 
may jeopardize grant continuation.  This form is available on the OCJA web page at 
http://www.ocj.nv.gov . 
 
Progress Reports:  Quarterly progress reports are required of subgrantees.  Failure to submit 
progress reports will jeopardize grant continuation.  Quarterly reports are due 30 days after 
the close of each quarter (Due Dates: January 30th, April 30th,  July 30th and October 30th).  
The final report is due by October 30th.  Forms are available on the OCJA web page at 
http://www.ocj.nv.gov . 
 
Project Evaluation:  Forty-five days (November 15th ) after the close of the grant, 
subgrantees are required to supply OCJA with an evaluation of the program for which grant 
funds were awarded.  This evaluation will be an important part of determining future 
funding. 
 
Supplanting 
 
Grant funds may not be used to replace state or local funds that would, in the absence of federal 
assistance, be available or forthcoming.  Instead, grant funds must be used to increase the total amount 
of other funds available for the grantee agency’s use. 
 
A grant recipient may not use federal grant funds to defray any costs that the recipient is already 
obligated to pay.  For example, if a grantee, prior to applying to participate in the grant program, had 
committed to purchase 10 new computers for crime analysis, then the grantee must purchase those 10 
computers in addition to any computers approved in the grant budget.

• 
a description of the geographic areas (s) affected; 
• 
a description of the problem and contributing factors; 
• 
documentation of the problem (statistical data);

Part 4.   
GOALS AND OBJECTIVES – (15 points) 
 
Project Goals:  This section should contain a separate discussion of each of the program goals and its 
accompanying objectives.  The goals are general statements of the desired results or anticipated 
outcome of the program.  They should address the problem identified in the problem statement.  The 
goals should be generic enough to encompass more than one project and be both realistic and 
achievable.  Goals should NOT be stated in measurable terms. 
 
• What do you want to achieve?  
• Explain the goal(s) of the project in simple, straightforward terms.  One or two overall goals 
are sufficient. 
• The goal(s) should identify intended impacts or outcomes and the results the program has 
been established to achieve. 
• Each goal should have one or more measurable objective describing how you intend to 
reach that goal. 
• Be realistic.   
• State your goals in such a way a determination of whether or not they are being achieved is 
possible. 
• Your goals MUST tie into your problem statement and outcome evaluation. 
 
 
Answer these questions in each objective: 
C 
WHAT you will do? 
C 
WHO will do the tasks? 
C 
WHEN will the activity be implemented? 
C 
HOW will they do it and HOW will they measure it? 
C 
INCLUDE a timetable; it demonstrates you have thought your program through. 
C 
AVOID the words might, if, could, should, would. 
C 
AVOID the words “To Provide”.  This is always a method to achieve the objective. 
 Project Objectives:  Each goal should have no more than four objectives.  The objectives are the 
specific approaches to achieving each of the goals.  Objectives focus on the methods/activities to be used 
to address the problem; they MUST be clearly stated, realistic, and measurable.   Use the statistics from 
the Problem Statement.  The measurements will be used in the evaluation of the project. The 
accomplishment of objectives should result in the achievement of the goals they support. OBJECTIVES 
THAT ARE NOT MEASUREABLE WILL BE CAUSE FOR REJECTION OF YOUR APPLICATION. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
PSN Program Application 
Page 7 
 
Objectives describe: 
• How you will achieve your goal(s)? 
• The activities necessary to accomplish your goals. 
• The objective in terms that can be measured, qualified, quantified and evaluated. 
• A timetable, where applicable, of when each objective will be met. 
 
To see an example of a measurable objective,   click here 
 
 
Tip:   Your goals and objectives MUST tie into the evaluation process.  Both of these sections will 
connect with your quarterly progress reports. Don’t have too many objectives, i.e. more than 
four is too many. Remember you must report on the progress of every objective quarterly.

Part 5.   
METHODS OF ACCOMPLISHMENT – (15 points) 
 
 
 
You MUST reference your goals and objectives and statistics from the Problem 
Statement.  This section should describe the activities you will use to accomplish the 
objectives.  Include the performance measures required by BJA.  Use the following 
guidelines: 
 
 
• Read your Problem Statement  
• Read the required Performance Measures. 
• How do you intend to solve the problem or improve the situation?

activity is being pursued. 
• Provide a narrative showing how PSN funding will impact or solve the stated 
problem. 
• A specific need for training must be identified.

Part 6.   
PROJECT EVALUATION/INTERNAL ASSESSMENT – (15 points) 
 
The evaluation must tie to the objectives and the BJA established performance measures. 
 If you have difficulty in determining what criteria to use in evaluating your program, 
better take another look at your objectives and how you plan to measure them. 
 
• How will you know the project is working?  
• How will you determine if you are meeting your objectives?  
 
Every project design must include an evaluation plan to determine whether the project is 
accomplishing its objectives.  The evaluation should be designed to provide an objective 
and independent assessment of the effectiveness or usefulness of the program.   
 
Provide a plan to determine whether the project accomplished the goals and objectives it 
was designed to meet.  The plan should present the qualifications of the evaluator.  
Describe the criteria used to evaluate the project’s effectiveness. Consider using an 
outside evaluator if at all possible.  This will make your results more credible. 
 
When submitting a final report, you must also submit your evaluation of the 
project.  Both are due 45 days after the end of the project period.

Part 8.   
STATEMENT OF COORDINATION – (4 points) 
 
Will other agencies be involved or have an interest in your program?   Who are they and what 
are their roles? 
 
Multi-jurisdictional task forces must provide a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU).  MOU  
must contain details as to the disposition of equipment purchased with grant funds if the task 
force is dissolved.  MOU must be updated and signed annually.  If a State of Nevada agency, 
an Inter-local Agreement must be submitted in lieu of an MOU. 
 
Many programs succeed due to the collaborated efforts of federal, state and/or local criminal 
justice, education, prevention, treatment and law enforcement agencies.  Describe your efforts to 
coordinate, cooperate, or work with other entities to ensure the success of the project activities. 
This will reflect favorably on your application.

BUDGET INFORMATION – (15 points) 
 
 
BUDGET COVER PAGE - All project costs MUST relate directly to and be necessary 
for the tasks described in the Methods.  The Budget Cover Page will be a simple line 
item budget identifying the following categories as they apply to your program:   
 
1. Personnel costs (all costs related to salary, benefits, etc.) 
2. Consultant/Contractual Services (costs must not exceed the federal limitation of  
$450 for an 8-hour day or $56.25 per hour) 
 
PSN Program Application 
Page 10 
 
3. Travel AND Training Costs (travel, transportation, room costs, meals, parking, etc.) 
Note:  State per diem rates will prevail unless local rates are less. 
4. Supplies/Operating Expenses 
5. Equipment  
 
Miscellaneous and Other are not considered costs.  If these terms are used in any category, the 
corresponding cost will be deducted. 
 
Round off budget figures - do not use cents.   (Example:  $170.57 will be $171.00)  All budgets 
are subject to OCJA modifications and approval.  Fill out ALL pages completely.  Estimate ALL 
costs to the nearest dollar.   
MAKE SURE THE NUMBERS ADD UP CORRECTLY AND MATCH THE TITLE PAGE. 
 
The budget form contains space for the budget justification (use additional sheet if necessary).  
This justification should include the details of how the amounts presented in the budget were 
determined.  Specific instructions for completing each section of the budget are included on the 
budget pages.  If you have questions or concerns related to how to complete the budget pages, 
please call (775) 687-3700 or an OCJA Program Manager for assistance (contacts). 
 
When reviewing your budget, ask “Is this budget reasonable?  Are these items necessary to the 
success of our program?” If you previously had a PSN grant, look at the budget for the last 2 
years versus this requested budget.  Are you duplicating purchases from previous years? 
Each Budget Category must be addressed separately as follows: 
 
Category A - PERSONNEL COSTS 
 
This category refers to wages and fringe benefits for regular or part-time salaried project 
employees.  Other persons working on the project who are not on the regular payroll must be

program activities. 
AVOID SUPPLANTING -- Do not request federal funding for an employee already on the 
payroll unless he/she will be replaced  by another person who is hired to augment regular agency 
staff during the time the existing employee spends working on project activities.  A regular 
employee, however, may be paid overtime for time worked on the project.  Salaries may not 
exceed those normally paid for comparable positions in the community and/or the unit of 
government associated with the project.

Example One 
 
Goal:  To maximize Court resources and reduce recidivism in each Court jurisdiction. 
 
Problem Statement:  The applicant should document the number of recidivists in each Court, then 
compare that number to existing and meaningful data, i.e., historical recidivism rates for that Court 
or, to statewide and national averages or, averages for similarly sized jurisdictions.  If your 
jurisdiction’s numbers are right-on with others (not notably higher), then you don’t have a problem 
and the use of grant funds here is not advised, since recidivism will always exist and yours is “as 
good as it gets.” 
 
Your goal actually contains two problems:  the first is recidivism and the second, Court resources.  
We cannot assume that recidivism by itself is the source of the Court’s overwhelm. 
 
So, you’ll also need to measure the impact that recidivists have on the Court. Your problem 
statement for this element should demonstrate that, of the total man-hours (account for Judges, 
prosecutors and support staff) per week/month/year the Court expends, xx% is spent dealing with 
recidivists.  Compare that to other Courts’ data as suggested above. 
 
Objective 1:  Now that you’ve measured the number of recidivists, you can measure the impact the 
proposed program will have on that statistical problem. Your measurable objective should answer 
these five important questions: 
 
1. 
Who 
2. 
Will do what 
3. 
When 
4. 
How much 
5. 
As measured by . . . 
 
So, an objective for this program might look like this: 
 
The number of recidivists appearing before the Court [who] will be reduced [will do what] by 8% 
[how much] in fiscal year 2003 [when], as measured by an ongoing analysis of Court records [as 
measured by]. 
 
In order for this objective to have merit: 
 
• The applicant must have measured the number of recidivists historically. 
• The applicant must forecast impact (a reduction of recidivism) based on real-world research 
of similar programs’ impacts, (not to be confused with fantasy and “I think I can” assertions.) 
• The applicant must track, on an ongoing basis, incidents of recidivism during the period of 
grant funding. 
 
The end result is an objective proposal in which the definition of success is agreed to in advance.  
Oversimplified, it reads like this:  “The Court sees 1,800 cases per year of which 400 are recidivists.  
The proposed program will reduce this number to 300 for a total annual recidivist case load of 1,400, 
and we’re going to prove it by counting the number of recidivists seen by the Courts next year.” 
 
 
It is important you distinguish between “process objectives” and “outcome objectives.”  We MUST 
have measurable “outcome objectives” to see what progress is being made in your program. 
 
Process objectives may be very useful but should only appear in the Methods section of your 
proposal so they are not confused with the results of your proposed. 
 
Example of a Process Objective (not acceptable in your application) 
 
Ten Narcotic officers will complete a 5 week training program by the end of the 2006 academic 
year, measured by program attendance records. 
 
Example of an Outcome Objective (acceptable in your application) 
 
Ten Narcotic officers [who] will increase their grant writing skills [what] by 20% [how much] by the 
end of the 2006 fiscal year [when] as measured by pre and post program test scores [as measured 
by]. 
 
If you can’t answers all of the five questions, then you have a Process Objective which will cause 
your application to be rejected.
