   CASE NO. 10-51913-NPO
DEBTOR.
CHAPTER 13
MEMORANDUM OPINION 
OVERRULING OBJECTION TO PROOF OF CLAIM
On January 10, 2011, this Court conducted a hearing (the “Hearing”) on the Objection to
Proof of Claim (the “Objection”) (Dkt. No. 23) filed by Douglas Wade Edwards (the “Debtor”), and
the Response to Objection to Secured Claim (the “Response”) (Dkt. No. 26) filed by Clay Young
(“Clay Young”) in the above-referenced chapter 13 proceeding.  At the Hearing, J. Thomas Ash
represented the Debtor, and J. Tyler McCaughn represented Clay Young.  For the following reasons,
the Court finds that the Objection should be overruled and the secured claim allowed.1

Clay Young satisfied the debt in full by paying Pikco $4,400;
4.
Clay Young filed his Proof of Claim on September 10, 2010, claiming to be a secured
creditor in the amount of $4,400; and
5.

Issue
The issue, which appears to be an issue of first impression before this Court, is whether Clay
Young’s Proof of Claim should be allowed as a secured claim.
Discussion
Miss. Code Ann. § 75-3-419 (Rev. 2010) governs instruments signed for accommodation in
Mississippi.  Pertinent subsections of § 75-3-419 provide as follows:
(a) If an instrument is issued for value given for the benefit of a party to the
instrument (“accommodated party”) and another party to the instrument
(“accommodation party”) signs the instrument for the purpose of incurring liability
on the instrument without being a direct beneficiary of the value given for the
instrument, the instrument is signed by the accommodation party “for
accommodation.”
. . . 
(f) An accommodation party who pays the instrument is entitled to reimbursement
from the accommodated party and is entitled to enforce the instrument against the
accommodated party.  In proper circumstances, an accommodation party may obtain
relief that requires the accommodated party to perform its obligations on the
instrument. An accommodated party who pays the instrument has no right of
recourse against, and is not entitled to contribution from, an accommodation party.
The Mississippi Supreme Court dealt with an accommodation party’s right of subrogation
in Murray v. Payne, 437 So. 2d 47 (Miss. 1983).  In Murray, the appellees were sureties on a note,
and as such, were accommodation parties.  Id. at 52.  The Mississippi Supreme Court held that, “[an

accommodation party’s] right of subrogation, recognized by the above statute,2 is his equitable right
to assert the rights of the creditor against the debtor.  Upon payment, the [accommodation party] is
said to “stand in the shoes” of the creditor.”  Id.  The Murray court further held that, “[n]ot only is
the accommodation party entitled to sue the maker of a note to recover the amount that the
accommodation party ends up paying, but he is also entitled to any collateral securing the note.” 
Id.  Hence, if the original creditor is a secured creditor, upon payment of the obligation, the
accommodation party steps into the position of the original creditor as a secured creditor.
In this case, the Debtor signed a note with Pikco to finance a vehicle.  Clay Young signed
the note as an accommodation party.  When the Debtor defaulted on payments to Pikco, Clay Young 
paid Pikco $4,400 to satisfy the debt.  Under Miss. Code Ann. § 75-3-419 (Rev. 2010) and the
reasoning in Murray, Clay Young “stands in the shoes” of Pikco as a secured creditor.3
Conclusion     
For the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that Clay Young, as an accommodation party to
the note and having satisfied the debt, is a secured creditor.  Accordingly, the Objection should be
overruled.  A separate order consistent with this Memorandum Opinion will be entered by the Court
in accordance with Fed.  R.  Bankr.  P.  7054, 9014, and 9021.
Dated this the 18th day of January, 2011.

2 At the time the Murray opinion was written in 1983, the applicable statute was Miss.
Code Ann. § 75-3-415 (Supp. 1982).  The applicable statute is now Miss. Code Ann. § 75-3-419
(Rev. 2010) (giving the accommodation party additional rights).
3 Since no other issue was raised as to Clay Young’s secured claim, and since this chapter
13 plan proposes to pay all creditors 100%, the Court declines to opine as to the extent to which
Clay Young’s claim is secured.
