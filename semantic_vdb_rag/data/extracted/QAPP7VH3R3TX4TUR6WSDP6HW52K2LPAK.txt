Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) [70 FR

to (1) Clarify the definition of ‘‘fifth 
freedom charter’’ by adding definitions 
of ‘‘sixth- and seventh-freedom 
charters’’ in § 212.2; (2) modify OST 
Form 4540 (Foreign Air Carrier 
Application for Statement of 
Authorization) by requiring updated 
reciprocity statements by foreign air 
carriers seeking a statement of

the best means to minimize confusion. 
Taking into account all the comments 
filed in response to our NPRM, we are 
persuaded to finalize our definitions as 
proposed. We are confident that the 
definitional changes that we are making 
should be adequate to address our 
public interest objectives in this 
rulemaking proceeding. 
Proposed Modifications to OST Form 
4540 
Evidence of Reciprocity 
two comments to the NPRM explicitly 
opposed the changes. The supporters 
said that the new definitions would 
serve to better delineate between 
different types of services, fifth-, sixth- 
and seventh-freedom, in both the 
scheduled and charter areas. NACA and 
AFL–CIO Transportation Trades 
Department (AFL–CIO TTD), although 
supporting the proposed new 
definitions for sixth- and seventh- 
freedom charters, would have us go 
further by having us define fifth- 
freedom charter so that it no longer 
encompasses flights that do not have 
any stops in the foreign air carrier’s 
homeland. The opponents, First Choice 
Airways and GWV Travel (GWV), assert 
that the new definitions go beyond the 
officially recognized ICAO ‘‘freedoms of 
the air,’’ are not required, and could 
cause confusion, including in the case 
of bilateral agreements that rely on the 
existing meaning of fifth-freedom. 
authorization under Part 212; and (3) 
require foreign air carrier applicants for 
a statement of authorization under Part 
212 to include historical data relative to 
the applicant’s U.S.-home country 
operations. 
The proposed definitional 
amendments to Part 212 would clarify 
that sixth-freedom charter means a 
charter flight carrying traffic that 
originates and terminates in a country 
other than the country of the foreign air 
carrier’s home country, provided the 
flight operates via the home country of 
the foreign air carrier; and that seventh- 
freedom charter means a charter flight 
carrying traffic that originates and 
terminates in a country other than the 
foreign air carrier’s home country, 
where the flight does not have a prior, 
intermediate, or subsequent stop in the 
foreign air carrier’s home country. 
The proposed revision of OST Form 
4540 would require that at the time of 
application for fifth-freedom charter 
authorization, the applicant foreign air 
carrier must present certification from 
its homeland government (or cite 
certification previously submitted to the 
Department that is dated within the 
previous 90-day period), that indicates 
that the carrier’s homeland grants to 
U.S. carriers a privilege similar to that 
requested by the applicant. The revision 
would also require applicant carriers to 
indicate on the application the number 
of third- and fourth-freedom flights the 
carrier has operated in the previous 
twelve-month period. 
Our issuance of the NPRM was taken 
in response to a petition for rulemaking 
filed by the National Air Carrier 
Association (NACA) on behalf of its 
member carriers. In the NPRM, after 
considering comments filed by 
interested parties in response to NACA’s 
petition, the Department proposed to 
make some, but not all, of the changes 
sought by NACA. In its comments 
concerning the NPRM, NACA stated 
that ‘‘We are grateful to the Department 
for the grant of NACA’s petition. While 
the Department clarifies that it is not 
granting all of the changes requested in 
NACA’s petition, the changes satisfy 
several of the more important concerns 
that NACA expressed in its petition.’’ 1 
We address each of our proposed 
regulatory changes, in turn, below. 
Proposed Modification to the 
Definitions in 14 CFR 212.2 
Summary of Comments 
Most of the commenters supported, 
did not object to, or were silent on our 
proposed definitional changes. Only 
1 NACA comments of March 22, 2005, at 1. 
Summary of Comments 
NACA, Airports Council 
International—North America (ACI– 
NA), AFL–CIO TTD, one U.S. indirect 
carrier (Apple Companies), and one U.S. 
direct air carrier (Amerijet) filed 
comments generally supporting our 
proposed change on evidence of 
reciprocity. They believe that the 
Department’s existing practice requires 
a finding of reciprocity and that the 
proposed revision only serves to 
formalize that existing practice. AFL– 
CIO TTD states that the requirement 
will provide a key decisional element to 
the record at the time of application. 
ACI–NA specifies that it does not 
object to the Department’s requirement 
of a reciprocity statement so long as it 
is not burdensome to carriers. First 
Choice Airways, for its part, states that 
while it is not opposed to an initial 
reciprocity certification, once a 
determination of reciprocity is made it 
should remain valid until challenged. 
While NACA supports our proposed 
change, it nevertheless suggests that our 
proposed 90-day recertification 
requirement be extended to require 
recertification every six months. 
Air Transportation Association of 
America (ATA), one U.S. carrier (Atlas), 
three U.S. indirect carriers (GWV, 
Vacation Express, and TNT Vacations), 
and seven foreign direct carriers 
(Antonov Design Bureau (Antonov), Air 
Atlanta Icelandic, Condor Flugdienst 
(Condor), Grupo TACA, Skyservice 
Airlines, and Thomas Cook UK) filed 
comments in opposition. ATA suggests 
that no reciprocity statement be 
required unless a U.S. carrier lodges a 
challenge. 
ATA, Atlas, and some foreign direct 
air carriers expressed their preference 
for maintaining the current system in 
which reciprocity is determined by the 
Department and aided by U.S. carrier 
objections on the record (when they feel 
that reciprocity is lacking) because they 
are aware of no problems that have 
arisen in relation to fifth-freedom 
charter operations. Some U.S. indirect 
carriers comment that instituting an 
official reciprocity requirement might 
DOT Decision on 14 CFR 212.2 
We will finalize the changes to 14 
CFR 212.2, as proposed. We find that 
the new definitions are an accurate 
reflection of the meaning of the terms 
presented, and should serve to better 
delineate the different forms of service 
involved without causing confusion. We 
further find that this action is consistent 
with Section 820 of the Vision 100— 
Century of Aviation Reauthorization 
Act, which conveyed the sense of 
Congress that the Department should 
formally define fifth-, sixth-, and 
seventh-freedom consistently for both 
scheduled and charter passenger traffic. 
We do not find that the commenters 
have presented persuasive arguments 
that our new definitions will generate 
confusion. In this regard, we find the 
general lack of opposition on the part of 
most commenters—many of whom will 
be using or be affected by the new 
definitions—to be significant. We will 
not, however, further amend this section 
to make changes to the definition of 
fifth-freedom charters as NACA and 
AFL–CIO TTD have suggested. While 
both commenters noted a degree of 
overlap in the definitions, we saw 
nothing in the comments received from 
other interested parties to indicate that 
they anticipated problems in applying 
or complying with the new definitions 
as proposed. In our NPRM we stated 
that we were proposing to amend our 
charter definitions because ‘‘even a 
limited degree of confusion is best 
avoided.’’ 70 FR 3158, 3163. We 
believed that specifically delineating the 
meaning of sixth- and seventh-freedom 
charters while not altering the long- 
established and widely-recognized 
definition of fifth-freedom charters was

cprice-sewell on PROD1PC71 with RULES
5782 
Federal Register / Vol. 71, No. 23 / Friday, February 3, 2006 / Rules and Regulations 
lead foreign governments to impose like 
requirements on U.S. carriers, thus 
redounding to the detriment of 
liberalized U.S. aviation policies. Some 
U.S. indirect carriers and foreign direct 
carriers state that a reciprocity 
certification requirement could become 
burdensome and in some cases even be 
unobtainable, especially given the short- 
notice nature of many fifth-freedom 
charter applications, thus chilling 
business, preventing market entry, and 
limiting competitive choices. 
Many foreign direct carriers believe 
that the reciprocity verification 
requirement does not serve any useful 
purpose and is inconsistent with the 
Department’s open-skies policy. Grupo 
TACA asserts that obtaining such 
certification is unnecessary given the 
small numbers of charters conducted by 
foreign carriers relative to the volume of 
charters provided by U.S. carriers in 
foreign markets. Yet others suggest that 
it will be difficult to obtain such a 
statement from foreign officials, 
especially in markets where the U.S. 
presence is minimal. Another feels that 
the Department has provided 
insufficient guidance as to what type of 
certification is necessary. One foreign 
direct carrier suggested that it be 
permitted to cite the certification 
provided by a foreign government to 
another carrier for these purposes. 
seventh-freedom charter operations and 
can speed the approval process. 
ACI–NA specifies that it has no 
problem with the proposed reporting 
requirement so long as it does not prove 
burdensome to carriers. Antonov states 
that it ‘‘does not object in principle to 
providing this information.’’ It is 
concerned, however, that considering 
the unique nature of outsized cargo 
services, information regarding third- 
and fourth-freedom charter flight 
information may provide an inadequate 
record for the Department to make a 
public interest determination regarding 
a carrier’s ‘‘undue reliance’’ on fifth-, 
sixth-, or seventh-freedom operations. 
ATA, three U.S. indirect carriers 
(GWV, Vacation Express, and TNT 
Vacations), and three foreign direct 
carriers (Air Atlanta Icelandic, Grupo 
TACA and Skyservice Airlines) 
submitted comments in opposition. 
They believe that the data we are 
requesting are already collected by the 
Department in the form of T–100 data, 
and thus our amendment to Form 4540 
is unnecessary and redundant. They 
comment that the reporting requirement 
imposes expense and delay on carriers 
without providing any added benefit. 
Vacation Express and TNT Vacations 
also suggest that the reporting 
requirement could have a chilling effect, 
discouraging carriers from applying and 
then likely limiting the services 
available to the public. Grupo TACA 
asserts that the additional reporting 
required by this revision to Form 4540 
is unnecessary, considering the relative 
dominance of U.S. charters operating in 
the U.S.-Central American market, and 
given that nearly all its members are 
domiciled in open-skies countries. 
While we have every confidence that 
the applicants provide information on 
Form 4540 to the best of their ability 
and knowledge and in good faith, the 
fact remains that the presence or lack of 
reciprocity is a matter resting within the 
control not of the applicant itself, but of 
its government. The applicant is at best 
a ‘‘second-hand’’ provider of such 
information. Our proposed rule 
provides a means for ensuring that the 
first-hand source for information on this 
essential element of our decisional 
process exist in the record to speak for 
itself. 
We are confident that in situations 
where reciprocity truly is not an issue, 
concerned governments will be able to 
work with their carriers to ensure that 
a streamlined process exists for getting 
the necessary statements to us in a way 
that should cause little if any additional 
burden or delay. Indeed, the nature of 
the exercise, by introducing into the 
record more probative evidence on this 
central issue, could serve to expedite 
the decisional process. 
Saying this, we have reflected on 
whether we need to see the reciprocity 
affirmations ‘‘refreshed’’ every 90 days. 
We believe that the commenters 
provided adequate evidence to persuade 
us to extend the length of validity of a 
reciprocity certification from 90 days to 
six months. We have concluded that 
changing to a six-month period should 
still provide sufficiently current 
information for the purposes presented, 
while addressing the concerns of some 
of the commenters who asserted that our 
90-day requirement was exceedingly 
burdensome. Of course, as we stated in 
the NPRM, if intervening events give 
reason to doubt the continuing validity 
of a particular verification, we will 
expect applicants to seek a new 
verification, even if their subsequent 
request is submitted within six months 
of a previous verification. 
Reporting of Third- and Fourth-Freedom 
Statistics 
DOT Decision on Reporting of Third- 
and Fourth-Freedom Operations 
In our NPRM, we specifically said 
that, in addition to reciprocity, the 
Department ‘‘also examines other factors 
that may be relevant in specific cases 
(for example, the extent of the 
applicant’s reliance on fifth-freedom 
operations in relation to its third- and 
fourth-freedom services).’’ 70 FR 3158, 
3162. In this regard, we proposed to 
amend OST Form 4540 so that 
applicants would specify the number of 
third- and fourth-freedom flights they 
have provided over the preceding 
calendar year. We expressly called upon 
applicants to present the information 
with sufficient clarity ‘‘for any 
commenting parties and the Department 
to readily evaluate the proposed 
services against the historical data.’’ Id., 
at 3163. 
As our NPRM indicated, the issue of 
excessive reliance on fifth-, sixth- and 
Summary of Comments 
NACA, ACI–NA, one U.S. direct 
carrier (Amerijet), and one U.S. indirect 
carrier (Apple Companies) submitted 
comments generally supporting our 
proposed change. These commenters 
acknowledge that carriers currently 
provide information to the Department 
regarding third- and fourth-freedom 
operations in the form of T–100 data, 
but note that the data are not readily 
accessible due to the delay in T–100 
data availability. NACA asserts that 
access to timely data can help carriers 
and the Department in evaluating 
applications for fifth-, sixth-, and 
DOT Decision on Evidence of 
Reciprocity 
We will finalize our requirement that 
applicants provide certification of 
reciprocity. Our NPRM states 
unequivocally that ‘‘reciprocity on the 
part of the applicant’s home country is 
the primary criterion for approval of the 
type of charter requests involved here.’’ 
70 FR 3158, 3162. In this, the NPRM 
was simply repeating longstanding 
Department policy and practice. Clearly, 
in evaluating the primary criterion for 
reaching a decision, the public interest 
calls for our having access to 
meaningful, reliable evidence. 
Given the short-notice nature of many 
of the requests for these types of 
services, we have found that we simply 
could not be assured that potentially 
interested parties, or we ourselves, 
might have the wherewithal in the 
limited time available to verify that an 
applicant’s assertion of reciprocity was 
justified in the specific circumstances 
presented. While input from aggrieved 
U.S. carriers or our own knowledge of 
a particular bilateral relationship can, of 
course, be informative—indeed in some 
instances fully dispositive, cases may 
well arise where the best available 
source of information on reciprocity 
will be the applicant itself.

5783 
Federal Register / Vol. 71, No. 23 / Friday, February 3, 2006 / Rules and Regulations 
seventh-freedom operations vis-a`-vis 
third- and fourth-freedom operations 
remains an element of our public 
interest analysis for applications of this 
type. As such, interested parties are 
entitled to have information that would 
enable them to offer meaningful 
comments on the record in this issue, 
and we ourselves would want to have 
data that permit us to give this issue 
appropriate consideration in our 
decisional process. 
We find that the reporting 
requirement we proposed should 
achieve those objectives. While we 
recognize, as some of the commenters 
point out, that T–100 data might cover 
some of the same terrain, they are no 
substitute. The T–100 program was 
never designed to provide a readily 
accessible data base for undue reliance 
evaluations in the context of the often 
short-notice, quick turnaround filings 
that characterize our charter approval 
process. It is entirely reasonable to 
expect that the data we are requesting 
should be in the applicant’s possession 
and that the applicant should be in a 
position readily to provide it. Given the 
role that such data might play in our 
public interest determination, and the 
absence of equivalent alternatives in the 
circumstances presented, on balance, 
we conclude that whatever burden may 
be entailed by this new requirement is 
clearly outweighed by the public 
benefits produced. We are not 
persuaded that this result will engender 
any form of chilling effect. The data at 
issue are data that carriers are already 
required to collect and transmit to us. 
Furthermore, our standards (including 
our standards as to undue reliance) are 
not changing; nor is the way in which 
we intend to apply these standards. Our 
amendment is essentially an 
administrative measure designed to 
promote an enhanced record and more 
efficient decision-making. 
unconvinced that the proposed NACA 
and Atlas change could be achieved 
without introducing the type of 
regulatory burden and delay we would 
wish to avoid. 
We reach a similar result with regard 
to the comments of Amerijet. Amerijet 
raises a procedural due process issue 
over the awarding of seventh-freedom 
cargo rights through bilateral 
negotiations and also raises policy 
questions relating to our approach on 
awarding fifth-, sixth-, and seventh- 
freedom charters. We regard these issues 
as well beyond the scope of the 
specifically focused regulatory 
procedural measures we announced in 
our NPRM—which Amerijet expressly 
‘‘welcomes and supports.’’ 3 
Consequently, we will not pursue them 
here. 
An additional comment beyond the 
scope of our contemplated changes is 
the ACI–NA recommendation that we 
consider amending our rules to cite the 
value of a proposed international 
charter to U.S. airports and their local 
economies as one of the public interest 
factors to be considered when we 
receive foreign carrier charter 
applications. We note this as essentially 
a suggestion offered for our future 
consideration. 
Finally, we note that commenters, 
such as TACA, wondered whether some 
of our proposed changes should even 
apply to them given prevailing open- 
skies regimes, and perhaps, also, 
bilateral seventh-freedom charter rights. 
We are certainly not seeking by this rule 
to impose filing requirements when 
none would be necessary from a public 
interest standpoint. Parties who believe 
there are clearly delineated bilateral 
rights, and that, therefore, they should 
not need to seek prior approval at all for 
certain charter operations are free to 
make appropriate requests for waivers 
or for adjustments to their underlying 
operating authority. 
Regulatory Analyses and Notices 
Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory 
Planning and Review) and DOT 
Regulatory Policies and Procedures 
Executive Order 12866, Regulatory 
Planning and Review, directs the 
Department to assess both the costs and 
the benefits of a regulatory change. We 
are not allowed to propose or adopt a 
regulation unless we make a reasoned 
determination that the benefits of the 
intended regulation justify the costs.

We have decided not to create a 
different Form 4540 regime for cargo 
charters. As we said above, the materials 
we are seeking are either within the 
possession of the applicant foreign 
carrier or are materials that they should 
be able to arrange readily for the 
homeland governments to provide. 
Therefore, we are unpersuaded that our 
changes will create an unworkable or 
unfair burden. We emphasize that we 
are not changing our applicable 
decisional standards or the nature of the 
findings we would need to make to 
support those decisions. Our changes go 
entirely to ensuring that those findings 
rest on a firmer evidentiary foundation. 
We regard this as entirely consistent 
with the public interest. 
NACA and Atlas would have us 
modify the rule to require significantly 
more detailed evidence from the foreign 
carrier applicant describing the cargo to 
be carried, bulk versus outsized. They 
are concerned that we are approving 
flights because of their asserted outsized 
cargo, when in fact the outsized cargo 
may actually represent only a portion of 
the actual cargo carried. Furthermore, 
Atlas states that given the typical short- 
notice nature of many fifth-freedom 
cargo charter requests, interested parties 
cannot file meaningful, timely responses 
unless that application includes more 
detailed information about the cargo to 
be carried. 
Antonov opposes this proposed 
change. It states that such a change 
would mean that applications could 
only be filed at the very last minute 
when packing lists were finalized and 
that even then numerous changes could 
still occur because shippers and 
charterers generally operate on the 
understanding that they are contracting 
for the entire aircraft and use this 
flexibility to make packing list changes 
right up to the time of departure. 
Antonov states that a cargo-specific 
approval requirement accordingly 
would be burdensome: Cumbersome for 
applicants, U.S. cargo carriers (who 
would need to be polled regarding the 
changes), and the Department. Antonov 
also comments that it would greatly 
impede the flow of commerce and cause 
costly delays to time-sensitive 
shipments. 
We will not adopt the modification 
proposed by NACA and Atlas. Unlike 
our other proposed changes, which we 
see as involving materials readily 
available or obtainable in ways that we 
are not persuaded would interfere with 
our existing regulatory approach, we are

Other Issues 
In addition to commenting on the 
specific aspects of our proposed rule, 
several commenters also offered other 
comments, either questioning aspects of 
our overall approach or requesting that 
we go even further in our proposed 
remedies. 
For example, Antonov objected to the 
Form 4540 changes applying to cargo 
charters as well as passenger charters. 
Antonov asserts that there are 
significant commercial and aeropolitical 
differences between cargo and passenger 
flights and that ‘‘it would harm U.S. and 
foreign carrier interests alike if the 
freely functioning global cargo charter 
market were suddenly subject to more 
burdensome and more restrictive new

carriers, that may or may not maintain 
offices in the U.S., because they must 
report data regarding the number of 
third- and fourth-freedom flights 
provided in the most recent twelve- 
month period. Although the affected 
carriers must record this information for 
other reporting requirements on a 
monthly basis, the significant time delay 
in collecting, analyzing, and publicly 
issuing these data significantly reduces 
the value of the data for purposes of 
evaluating fifth-freedom charter 
applications. With minimal burden, the 
affected carriers can provide a record of 
the number of flights provided within 
the last twelve-month period by adding 
the numbers reported to the Department 
for each of the previous twelve months, 
and recording the sum on application 
OST Form 4540, thus providing all 
interested parties with current, detailed 
information vital to proper evaluation of 
applications. Furthermore, this 
reporting requirement will have no net 
effect on the way in which foreign air 
carriers conduct business or on the 
manner in which the Department 
evaluates the merits of fifth-freedom 
charter applications. 
because of public interest. The NPRM 
was reviewed by the Office of 
Management and Budget under 
Executive Order 12866. Our assessment 
of this rulemaking indicates that its 
economic impact is minimal because 
the rule will impose only minimal 
incremental new costs on applicant 
carriers, and codifies, in part, existing 
practice. The rule clarifies, by 
definition, the types of charters being 
conducted; requires that applicant 
foreign carriers cite certification from 
the carrier’s homeland government 
stating that it affords reciprocity to U.S. 
fifth-freedom charters; and, requires that 
foreign air carriers accurately represent 
the number of third- and fourth-freedom 
flights conducted in the previous 
twelve-month period. 
The definitional changes will not 
affect the manner in which foreign air 
carriers conduct business; nor will it 
affect our decision-making process. 
Reciprocity is a public interest criterion 
already considered in evaluating fifth-, 
sixth- and seventh-freedom charter 
applications. The required certification 
will be required only once every six 
months. The data regarding third- and 
fourth-freedom flights we now require 
should be in the applicant’s possession 
and the applicant should be in a 
position readily to provide it at the time 
of application.

A regulation identifier (RIN) is

in the Unified Agenda of Federal

engaging in certain charter operations to 
and from the United States. The 
Department grants or denies the 
authorization to the foreign air carrier. 
Foreign air carriers file this form as 
often as necessary whenever they wish 
to perform charter flights for which 
prior Department approval is required 
by Part 212. This form is required for all 
foreign air carriers seeking Department 
authority to conduct certain types of 
charter flights, and does not require a 
significant amount of time to complete, 
and is not burdensome to complete. 
OMB Number: 2106–0035. 
Title: 14 CFR Part 212—Charter Rules 
for U.S. and Foreign Direct Air Carriers. 
Burden hours: 1000. 
Affected public: Business or other for- 
profit. 
Cost: $400,000.00. 
Description of Paperwork: The 
proposed changes to the rulemaking and 
the form are intended to improve the 
Department’s ability to assess the merits 
of applications filed under Part 212, and 
will ensure that the Department has the 
most current information on the state of 
reciprocity for each foreign carrier 
applicant for charter authority filed 
under Part 212. These proposed changes 
will also enhance the Department’s 
decision-making process without 
imposing an undue burden on 
applicants or affecting the public 
benefits that the Department’s rules now 
provide. The collection of historical 
data relative to the applicant’s U.S.- 
home country operations will allow the 
Department to satisfy any concerns it 
might have as to the applicant’s reliance 
on fifth-, sixth- and seventh-freedom 
operations. 
List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 212 
Air carriers, air transportation, charter 
flights, reporting and recordkeeping 
requirements. 
Unfunded Mandates Reform Act 
The changes proposed would not 
impose any unfunded mandates for the 
purpose of the Unfunded Mandates 
Reform Act of 1995. 
Executive Order 13132 (Federalism 
Assessment) 
The Department has analyzed this 
rulemaking action in accordance with 
the principles and criteria set forth in 
Executive Order 13132 and has 
determined that it does not have 
sufficient federalism implications to 
warrant consultation with State and 
local officials. The Department 
anticipates that any action taken will 
not preempt a State law or State 
regulation or affect the States’ ability to 
discharge traditional State government 
functions. 
I For the reasons set forth in the 
preamble, the Department amends Part 
212 as follows: 
PART 212—CHARTER RULES FOR 
U.S. AND FOREIGN DIRECT AIR 
CARRIERS 
I 1. The authority citation for 14 CFR 
part 212 continues to read as follows: 
Authority: 49 U.S.C. 40101, 40102, 40109, 
40113, 41101, 41103, 41504, 41702, 41708, 
41712, 46101. 
I 2. Amend § 212.2 by adding, in 
alphabetical order among the existing 
definitions, a definition of ‘‘Seventh 
freedom charter’’ and a definition of 
‘‘Sixth freedom charter.’’ 
Paperwork Reduction Act 
Under the Paperwork Reduction Act 
of 1995, 44 U.S.C. 3501–3520, Federal 
agencies must obtain approval from the 
Office of Management and Budget 
(OMB) for each collection of 
information they conduct, sponsor, or 
require through regulations. This rule 
contains information collection 
requirements. As required by the 
Paperwork Reduction Act, the 
Department will submit this 
requirement to the Office of Information 
and Regulatory Affairs of the OMB for 
review, and reinstatement, with change, 
of a previously approved collection. 
OST Form 4540 is a required 
Application for Statement of 
Authorization for foreign air carriers to 
file with the Department prior to 
Regulatory Flexibility Act 
The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 
U.S.C. 601, et seq.) requires an agency 
to review regulations to assess their 
impact on small entities unless the 
agency determines that a rule is not 
expected to have a significant impact on 
a substantial number of small entities. 
Because this rule does not subject U.S. 
carriers to new procedures or reporting 
requirements, the Department certifies 
that this rule will not have a significant 
economic impact on a substantial 
number of U.S. small businesses. 
The Department notes, however, that 
this rule imposes a minimal additional 
paperwork burden on foreign air
