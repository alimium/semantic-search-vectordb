Budget Amount:  
$180,468.00
Project Narrative:  Cedarville School District will give an incentive of $600.00 to all employees.  The purpose of this 
incentive is to retain highly qualified employees.  The cost will be $84,659.00 for the staff 
excluding district personnel.  The remaining $95,809.00 will be used to hire two teachers for the 
2011-2012 school year for the purpose of double blocking Math and Literacy at the Middle School.
Goals:  
College and Career Ready Preparation
Teachers Effectiveness and Equitable Distribution
Goal Justification:  Cedarville is a small rural school located 9 miles north of a large school district that offers higher 
pay schedule.  The jobs fund money incentive of $600.00 will give the district a chance to 
compensate the staff for their dedication and to retain a highly qualified staff.  Cedarville Middle 
School has just added 6 classrooms and a new P.E. facility.  The addition of classrooms will 
provide the needed classrooms to double block Math and Literacy.  The progress monitoring of 
the Middle School students indicates the need for additional instruction time in Math and Literacy.  
The students will be tested 3 times a year using the MAP test to monitor the effectiveness of the 
double blocking.  The results will be used to monitor the continuation of double blocking.  The 
information obtained from the monitoring of the double block data will be used to guide the High 
School schedule needs.  This will help the district offer classes to better prepare our students for 
college and careers.
