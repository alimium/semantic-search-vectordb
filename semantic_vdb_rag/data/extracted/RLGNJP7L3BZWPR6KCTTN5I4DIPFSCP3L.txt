because of the efficacy of iron alone.
'Results of adequate therapy
are highly predictable, and effectiveness is usually determined 'most
efficiently from the rise in hemoglobin (5).
Although blood ualues
return rapidly to normal, iron therapy must be continued for
extended periods of time in order to reconstitute the iron stores
,
in,the tissues.
As. early as'1893 Blankenstein (19) suggested that the signifi-
cance of iron-deficiency anemia may be important in the diagnosis. of
c
lesions of the oral cavity.
Suzman,(32) in 1933, reported an inves-
,
tigation.of the etiology of Plummer-Vinson Syndrome
and its relation
ship.to "idiopathic .hypochromic anemia".
He acknowledged that
the relaiioniip between anemia and 'the syndrome "had alwayS been p
subject'of contention ".
In 1938 Waldenstrom (34),expressed concern
o
thae'the study of.so-called hypochromic anemia and syuptpms

Ling epithelial tissues had not-aroused much
interest.
Darby (7) reflected in 1946 that recent interest in
viCamin M
complex deficienRies.ascauses of lesions of the budtal eissfies had
led to the unjustified claim by many investigators
that all such
lesions were manifestations of vitamin deficiencies.
It was claimed
,
that 'changes in the lingual papillae were specifically due to niacin
deficiency, and that glossitis was probably due to chronic
niacin
deficiency.
It was airther implied that fissuies at the angles of
tlse mouth (ckleilosis) were due to rihoflavindeficency, although it
''had been shown that these. lesions may heal.after administration
of

Suzman (32) studied eight cases of Plummer- Vinson Syndrome a
the'Massachusetts General,Hospital over a period of two years.
The'',
patients were all women between, the ages of 27 and 61.
Clinical yl
features mahifested by these pati9ts-were:
burning, red tongue
r.t
which appeared atrophic, smooth and shiny, with fissures present.at-
.
the anglIs of the mouth; and dysphagia (tightness in thd esophagus).
Six of the patients were
found to have hemoglobin concentrations
which ranged from 35 to 60' ,Pr cent at the initial examination.
These six patients were given a prescribed daily treatment'of
iron
r.
with ammonium citrate in concentrations ranging, from
3.8 grams to
11.6 grams.
Treatments were continued for 'Periods' of time ranging
from one to two months. ,'Final data were available \for four of these
six patients whose hemoglobin concentrations were found to have
increased fromp to 30 per Cent.
Their overall physical conditions
were improved, and there was marke improvement in the conditiong of
1.
the mouth and tongue.
Suzman (32) reported a seventh patieit who w s found
to-have

This patient was given intramuscular administr

PRESENTATION OF FINDINGS
-
Data which support this experimental ifivebtigation are reported
and presented in tIL present chapter.
Findings' include the manifes-
tations of aphthous ulcers, glossitis, and cheilosis in the oral
cavities of '25 subjects, the effects of ferrous Aluconate therapy 'on
the control of these lesions in selected subjects, and the initial
and final readings of htmoglobin levels of all subjects possible.

that she did 'indeed

Further, when these

find that the initial hemoglobin 14vel was considered high at

Case 11.
The subject was a 46-year-old female who was referred
to the clinic by her dentist on April-23, 1970.
She reported a
four -month history of glossitis and cheilosis.
At this first exaMina-
tion,she complained that she was very tired and sleepy much of the
'time,_that her tongue was sore, and the corners of her lips were
.
cracked.' Her hemoglobin level was 15.1 g/100 ml at this initial
visit.. Ferrous gluconate (320 mg.) therapy was recommended, one

tablet three times each dax for 30 day's.
The subject tailed to.re,

he to do so.
A telephone call to her was made in March 191,% and
she indicated thar.she was feeling fine.
She was convinced that her
'oral problems had been caused by rough treatment given her by an oral-
hygienist.
The investigator was unable to procure a second hemoglobin
level.

In case 11, the subject may'have bee'n accurate in her selfdiag-
nosis, for her hemoglobin level of 15.1 g/100 ml was' of high normal
range at the first visit to the clinic.
Case 11 was one of the three
subjects (cases 3, 11, 20) of this investigation whose hemoglobin
level was 15.0 g/100 ml orhigher at the first visit to the clinic.

Case 12.
The subject was a 53-yaar-old- female volun eer Who
,'
came to die clinic on June 8, 1972 reporting a one-month history of
,---
glossitisand swollen lips..
The initial oral examination revealed
a fiery -red tongue.
The hemoglobin level.was 12.7 g/100.m1, and the,
4
hematocrit was 38'.0 per cent.
yarrous gluconate (320 mg.) was
recommended, one tablet each day for t'io weeks.
The subject returned
to ?the clinic on July 13, 1972.
Her tongue appeared normal but her
lips were still swollen.
The hemoglobin at this second visit was

13.4 g/100 ml, and her hematocrit was 40.0 pel cent.
She returned to

third visit.had dropped'to 12.0 g/I00 ml, and the hematocrit reading
droppecrto 37.0 per cent.
She was advised to resume the ferrous

gluconate therapy.
In case 12 it is believed that

Lt may Be seen in Table 2 that observations of

Although subjects were requested to

Continued ehcouragement was required

Subjects indicated that they

wanted healthy mouths
free of disease,, pain, and high cost of correc=

When they were enduring intense pain, nd real
effort was necessary
.
to encourage subjects to make the initial visit
to the clinic.
However, once free of immediate pain,'Lhe need for a

Inspection of Table'2 reveals that, atypical,' conditions exhibited

complete hemoglobin determinations were made showed at least some increase
.
in the level following ferrous gfuconate treatment.
Hemoglobin level. readings were incomplete for cases numbered six,
.
eight, and,eleven.
The investigator was unable to procure any hemoglobin
determinations for, case numbelr six.
Casesnumber eight and number '11
reported oral conditions by way of telephonefot the second visit, and did,
not report to the clinic for a second hemoglobin reading.
It may be seen in Table 2 that the final assessment of the oral con-
dition, which was made by the dental consultant at the final visit, is
given in simple terms of improvement.
Further eAaminacion of Tslble 2
,
discloses that nine of the 12 subjects for whom data "ere available (75
(
per cent) showed marked improvement in the oral conditions following treat-
ment with ferrous gluconte.
The thirteenth subject, case number 11, did
k
not return to the clinic for final evaluation but reported by telephone
that she "felt fine".

( Two subjects, case number two and cage number eight, were the only
two cases who showed no improvement in the oral conditions following the
ferrous g:luconate treatment.

Table 2 that,the level,of hemoglobin for thi§ case could be con-
sidered at a hf;',44 lev, at the initial vistt, (15 g), and after

therapy wasincreased to 15.5 g.
Cause far his failure to.improve
remains in doubt.
Effects of Treatment ReAdered to 12 Subjects
without Use of Ferrous Gluconate
'
.Subjects numbered 14 through 25 were treated without the use.of
A
ferrous glpconate.
It is pointed out, that the therapeutic Management
of oral lesions manifested in most of these subjects was attempted
through use of Tetracycline mouthwash, Kenalog in Drabas.g, and in
.
one case, Zinc oxide. .Systemic steroids were used in three cases
A
where lesionS were "too extensive, too deep, and too numerous, oin
areas to which topical steroid ointment cannot be easily applied"
(31).
It Is emphasized that these drugs were given only as temporary
medications, since they do not prevent oral lesions from recurring.
The drugs do, however, reduce the pain and curtail the length of time
during which lesions,will persist.

14.07 g.
The <change in hemoglobin levels from the initial visit to
the second visit of subjects ranged from -1.2 g to +1.8 g, showing'
an average increase of 0.77 g.
It may be observed in Table 3 that
cases numbered 17, 20, 31, and 25 show an increase in hemoglobin
levels of 1.4 to 1.8 g.
These four subjects reported that they had
taken oral, iron supplements of their own accord,
or that they had
received a prescription from their physiCians.
These supplements
may account for the fact that their hemoglobin levels were increased
more than those of the other three subjects for whom readings were
taken.
Hemoglobin level readings were incomplete for cases numbered
'14,
18, 19, 23, and 24 since the investigator was unable to secure
a second hemoglobin reading.

the dental consultant at the 'subject's final visit

It may be observed that only

two additional subjects, cases 21 and 25 showed only moderate
.improvement.

evalua ion of his condition.
.flypotheses
It was hypothe4zed first that the hemoglobin level in the blood
is related to the recurrence of such oral lesioqsas glossitis,
aphthous ulcers and,angular cheilosis.
Those subjects. in wiom
the
hemoglobin was increased to a level of 13.4 g or higher, whether or
not they received therapy with ferrous' gluconate, all showed at
least some improvgment in oral conditions,
Those patients whose
hemoglobin levels at the last cl;ar visit were recorded at 12.9 g
or lower showed no improvement in oral conditions.
It has been stated previously that assessment of normal values
for hemoglobin has been asignated at levels ranging upwtrd from 13.5
g/100 ml.
It seems reasonable to conclude that the findings of this
investigation support the hypothesis that l!emoglobin lqvc1I-nt
lower margin or,below the recognized minimum normal range may accom-
N4.44/
pany or promote the occurrence of oral lesions such as glossitis,
aphthous ulcers and angular cheilOsis.
It may be concluded furthers
that as hemoglobin levels are increased, these oral conditions are
, improved.'
.
The second hypothesis was that therapy with iron supplements
will reduce or control tfe occurrence of glossitis, aphthous ulcers
and angular cheilosis.
Data availablefor 12 of the 13*subjects

who were selected to receive

therA was doubt that one Subject followed instructiods for the
ferrous glv.anate therapy; one subject failed .to return to the clinic
for reevaldion;
and the third subjeCtdemonstTated only slight
improvement.
These findings seem to,be consistent with those of
Suzman (32),Waldenstrom (34) and Darby (7)..
On the basis of these
findings, the hypothesis is accepted.

SUMMARY, CONCLUSiONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Summary
The purpose bf the present study was
to present an experimental
investigation of the manifestations of aphthous ulcers,
glossitis,
and cheilo8is in the oral cavities of 25 subjects, the use of ferrous
gluconate supplements on the control of
these lesiods in 13 selected
subjects, and the hemoglobin levels at initial.and final clinic visits
ofall subjects for time periods which varied Irom one month to four
yearS.
The investigation was delimited to a study of subjects who
were solicited in the
Gainesville, Florida area, or who were referred
--,
to the dental clinic of the'aCollege of Dentistry at phe University of
Florida. -Selection of subjects was ?invited to the judgment of 'the
dental consultant who was preseht in the clinic at the time of the
o
initial visit.
His assessment of oral conditions.
and selection of
therapy preScribed were the final judgmentf..
Petermiw.tion of the
hemoglobin level was made by the'inveStigator, a registered technolo-
gist, and was limited to the use of the'cyanmethemoglobin.procedure.
;.
'In order to accomplish the purposes of the study, th% following
hypotheses were postulated:
li' The hemoglobin level in the blood.is related to the occurrence:
of such oral lesions as glossitis, aphthous ulcers, and angular cheilp-
sis:

2.
Therapy with iron supplements
will reduce or control the ti'. ,
occurrence of glossitis, aphthous ulcers, and angular cheilosis
Terms were defined as
their meanings were interpreted for use
in the pr sent
investigation.
A thorough study and review of related
.
literature was made, and it was revealed that few studies have at
t._
tempted the investigation 6flthe occurrence of these oral lesions with
the possible relatedness of hemoglobin levels, and the effects
of
therapy with only iron supplements..
Data which support this experimental investigation"Were provided
by theeparticipation of 13 subjects who-were selected by
the dental
consultant to receive ferrous gluconate suplements during the experi
mental period, and by 12 subjects who received no ferrous,ilconate
treatment.
Clinical, laboratory, and deriptiv
datg were obtained
at the sublet's initialiand final visits.
All data were:tabulated
and summarized for purposes
of comparison and interpretation of
the
findings.
Interpretations were made with
particular reference to
apparent relationships between the hemoglobin level and
periodic
occurrence and reduction
of oral manifestations of aphthous- ulcers,
. glossitis and angular theilosis.
°*1
Conclusions
On the basis, of the findings, and.within the limitations
posed in the present Avest
tion, the following conclusions .;1;;.4c-41ade:
1.
Presence of the drat
sions of aphthous ulcers,
glossitis
and cheilosis does not appear
to be significantly related to hemoglobi
levels which fall well within the generally accepted normal limits.
1
V
2.
Although hemoglobin levels may fall within the generally.

accepted normal 1. its, ferrous gluconate supplements have a profound
effect, upon reversal of
established oral lesions and the prevention
of recurrences.
3.
Hemoglobin levels which are at the lower
limits, or below
1/4,Alk
the recognized minimum normal range seem to accompany or promote the
occurrence of oral lesions
such as glossitis, aphthous ulcers and
%
angular cheilosis, and as hemoglobin leVels are increased, the oral
conditions are improved/
t.
4.
Eemales appear to have a tendency toward occurrence of iron
deficiency more often than males,
especially during the Childbearingt.,
years, and therefore show more ,frequent Manifestatiens of pral
lesions apparently related. to the hemoglobin level in-the blood.
1
5.
When ferrous gluconate supplements are prescribed for the
Management of oral lesions such as aphthous ulcers, glossixis and
cheilosis, subjects show' inareaS4 in hemoglobin determinations, and
the majority show marked improvement in the oral conditions following
treatment.
6.
When ferrous gluconate supplements are not prescribed for
the management of, Oral'lesions such as aphthous ulcers, :glossitis and
,cheilosis, subjects show no improvement in the oral conditions.
4
7.
Although the regular intake
iron supplements is not recom,
mended, it appears that some subjects
require daily supplements until
theltsions
resolve, and,some subjects require,daily
supplements,
indefinitely.
