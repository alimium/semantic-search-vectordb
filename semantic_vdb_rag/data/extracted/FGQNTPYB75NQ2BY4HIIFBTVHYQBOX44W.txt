FIXED ASSET MANUAL 
TRANSFERRING AN ASSET TO 
ANOTHER AGENCY 
INTRODUCTION 
Transferring an asset between agencies simply means that one agency sends an asset to another 
agency. The agency transferring the asset out is referred to as the "transfer out" agency and the 
agency receiving the asset is referred to as the "receiving agency". 
 
The book value of the asset is an important factor in determining how to record the transaction. 
If the book value of the asset is less than $5,000, the agency transferring will treat the transaction 
as a disposition, e.g., a donation or scrap, using transaction codes DD1 through DD4, depending 
on the class of asset. The receiving agency can enter the acquisition by whatever method seems 
appropriate. 
If the book value of the asset is $5,000 or more, both agencies should contact the DSAHelpline 
for assistance. 
TO TRANSFER AN ASSET WITH A BOOK VALUE OF LESS 
THAN $5,000 
The transfer out agency should dispose of the asset using the following steps: 
1. Type 35 at the FAS Main Menu and press ENTER. 
2. Enter an A in the FUNCTION field, and enter the property number and component 
number in the PROP NO and COMP NO fields. Confirm that the property and 
component number exactly match the record in the FAS Property File (i.e., screen S040). 
3. Enter the sequence number (usually 0001) in the SEQ NO field. 
4. Enter the transaction code (FAS TC) for the class code of the property number being 
disposed. The FAS TC will be DD1, DD2, DD3, or DD4. (Refer to FAS Descriptor 
Table 15.) 
5. Enter the status code in the STATUS field. 
For a full disposition, enter the following: 
• D (disposed) 
6. Enter a disposition code (e.g., S (if Sold), D (donated or scrapped), etc.) in the DSP 
MTH field. (Refer to FAS Descriptor Table 22 for more disposition codes.) 
7. Enter the amount of cash actually received in the ADT AMT field. 
8. Enter the three-digit number representing the percentage of the asset being disposed in 
the DISP % field. For a full disposition, enter 100. 
9. Enter the disposition date in the ADT DATE field.

10. Enter the quantity in the QTY field. For a full disposition, the quantity should equal that 
of the asset in the FAS Property File. 
11. Press F1 or ENTER to post the record to the FAS Property File. 
• If you do not have disposition-release authority (i.e., approval level 3 or lower), 
'INVALID APPROVAL LEVEL' will appear in the message section of the screen, 
and the status in the FAS Hold File record will be 'H'. 
• If you have disposition-release authority (i.e., approval level 4 or greater), 'RECORD 
ADDED' will appear in the message section of the screen and there will be a 'P' in the 
FAS Hold File record. 
 
The receiving agency should enter the acquisition using standard acquisition steps. Click here for 
steps to enter acquisitions.
