What are Nautical Charts? 
 
Nautical charts are a fundamental tool of marine navigation.  They show 
water depths, obstructions, buoys, other aids to navigation, and much 
more.  The information is shown in a way that promotes safe and 
efficient navigation.  Chart carriage is mandatory on the commercial 
ships that carry America’s commerce.  They are also used on every Navy 
and Coast Guard ship, fishing and passenger vessels, and are widely 
carried by recreational boaters. 
 
What is a BookletChart? 
 
This BookletChart is made to help recreational boaters locate 
themselves on the water.  It has been reduced in scale for convenience, 
but otherwise contains all the information of the full-scale nautical 
chart.  The bar scales have also been reduced, and are accurate when 
used to measure distances in this BookletChart.  See the Note at the 
bottom of page 5 for the reduction in scale applied to this chart. 
 
Whenever possible, use the official, full scale NOAA nautical chart for 
navigation.  Nautical chart sales agents are listed on the Internet at  
http://www.NauticalCharts.NOAA.gov.   
 
This BookletChart does NOT fulfill chart carriage requirements for 
regulated commercial vessels under Titles 33 and 44 of the Code of 
Federal Regulations. 
 
Notice to Mariners Correction Status 
 
This BookletChart has been updated for chart corrections published in 
the U.S. Coast Guard Local Notice to Mariners, the National Geospatial 
Intelligence Agency Weekly Notice to Mariners, and, where applicable, 
the Canadian Coast Guard Notice to Mariners.  Additional chart 
corrections have been made by NOAA in advance of their publication in 
a Notice to Mariners.  The last Notices to Mariners applied to this chart 
are listed in the Note at the bottom of page 7.  Coast Pilot excerpts are 
not being corrected.

the entrance and 10 to 12 feet in the bay proper. The entrance should 
be approached from the W, but care must be taken to stay off the 
sandbar that makes out from the NW side. The bay has good holding 
bottom and good protection from ice and winds. 
Tundra-covered Humphrey Point (69°58.3'N., 142°30.9'W.), on the SE 
side of Pokok Bay, has a low bluff and a narrow sand beach. SE of Siku 
Point are low barrier islands that cover in many places at high water. The 
seaward sides of the islands are irregular, and small boats must stay well 
offshore. 
Angun Lagoon, behind the barrier reef between Humphrey Point 
and Angun Point, 4 miles to the SE has depths of 10 to 11 feet. There is a 
10-foot bluff at Angun Point. The lagoon entrance, 1 mile NW of Angun 
Point, is 75 to 100 yards wide and has a controlling depth of 8 feet. The 
barrier islands are subject to change; entrance must be made with 
caution. 
Beaufort Lagoon, with depths of 5 to 12 feet in the middle, extends 
about 14 miles SE behind the barrier reef from Angun Point to Siku 
Point. The SE part of the lagoon from the delta of Aichilik River to Siku 
Point has not been surveyed but the entrances are known to be very 
shallow and subject to change. The principal entrance to the lagoon is a 
narrow channel with a depth of 2 to 5 feet about 1.8 miles SE of Angun 
Point; caution is advised. 
Nuvagapak Lagoon, with depths of 8 to 10 feet in the middle, is S of 
Beaufort Lagoon and extends SE to the delta of Aichilik River from 
Nuvagapak Point, a high tundra 1 mile back of the reef and 3.5 miles SE 
of Angun Point. Egaksrak Lagoon, S of Beaufort Lagoon between the 
delta of Aichilik River and Siku Point, has not been surveyed.

(Selected Excerpts from Coast Pilot) 
Griffin Point (70°03.6'N., 142°52.4'W.) is a 
low sandspit that projects out from the 
mainland. A mile WNW of the point 
is Oruktalik Entrance, a narrow barrier 
passage through which a depth of about 5 
feet can be taken into Oruktalik Lagoon. 
The barrier islands off Griffin Point continue 
SE for 3 miles; thence to Pokok Bay are 25-
to 30-foot bluffs fronted by narrow, steep 
sand beach except for the last 1.5 miles. 
Small boats can navigate very close to the 
beach between Griffin Point and Pokok Bay. 
Pokok Bay, 17 miles SE of Martin Point, is about 1 mile across. Bars 
extend out from both sides of the entrance. Depths are about 7 feet in
