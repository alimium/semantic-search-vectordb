Effect of election. 
§ 1.9004–1
Election relating to the de-
termination of gross income from 
the property for taxable years be-
ginning prior to 1961 in the case of 
certain clays and shale. 
(a) In general. The Act of September 
26, 1961 (Pub. L. 87–312, 75 Stat. 674), 
provides that certain taxpayers may 
elect to apply the provisions thereof to 
all taxable years beginning before Jan-
uary 1, 1961, with respect to which the 
election is effective. The Act prescribes 
special rules for the application of sec-
tion 613 (a) and (c) of the Internal Rev-
enue Code of 1954 (and corresponding 
provisions of the Internal Revenue 
Code of 1939) in the case of shale and 
certain clays used by the mine owner 
or operator in the manufacture of cer-
tain clay and shale products. 
(b) Election. The election to apply the 
provisions of the Act may be made only 
by a mine owner or operator with re-
spect to brick and tile clay, fire clay, 
or shale which he mined and used in 
the manufacture of building or paving 
brick, drainage and roofing tile, sewer 
pipe, flower pots, and kindred products. 
The election must be made in accord-
ance with § 1.9004–4 on or before Decem-
ber 11, 1961, and the election shall be-
come irrevocable on December 11, 1961. 
(c) Years to which the election is appli-
cable. If the election described in para-
graph (b) of this section is made by the 
taxpayer, the provisions of the Act 
shall be effective for all taxable years 
beginning before January 1, 1961, in re-
spect of which the: 
(1) Assessment of a deficiency, 
(a) In general. If a taxpayer makes 
the election described in paragraph (b) 
of § 1.9004–1, he shall be deemed to have 
consented to the application of the Act 
with respect to all the clay and shale 
described in that paragraph for all tax-
able years for which the election is ef-
fective whether or not the taxpayer is 
litigating the issue for any of such 
years. Thus, in applying section 613 of 
the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (and 
corresponding provisions of the Inter-
nal Revenue Code of 1939) to those 
years: 
(1) The ‘‘gross income from the prop-
erty’’ for purposes of section 613(c) of 
the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (and 
corresponding provisions of the Inter-
nal Revenue Code of 1939) shall be 50 
percent of the amount for which the 
mineowner or operator sold, during the 
taxable year, the building or paving 
brick, drainage and roofing tile, sewer 
pipe, flower pots, and kindred products 
manufactured from the clay and shale 
described in paragraph (b) of § 1.9004–1, 
but shall not exceed an amount equal 
to $12.50 multiplied by the number of 
short tons of all such clay or shale 
mined and used by the mineowner or 
operator in the manufacture of the 
products sold during the taxable year; 
and 
(2) The ‘‘taxable income from the 
property’’ (computed without allow-
ance for depletion) for purposes of sec-
tion 613(a) of the Internal Revenue 
Code of 1954 (and corresponding provi-
sions of the Internal Revenue Code of 
1939) shall be 50 percent of the taxable
