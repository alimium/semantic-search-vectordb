EMERGENCY FIREFIGHTER HIRING 
 
Emergency Firefighters (EFF) must be 18 years of age to be eligible for employment.   
Individuals can receive crew training at age 16 or older. 
 
The Division of Forestry (DOF) employs three categories of Emergency Firefighters (EFF) 
in its wildland fire program:  
 
• Type II EFF crews  
• Non-crew EFF   
 
Type II EFF crews are hired, managed, and paid by the State of Alaska or BLM under the 
guidelines set forth in the Alaska Interagency Emergency Firefighter Type II Crew 
Management Guide.  The list of Designated Crews is found on page 22 & 23 and the key to 
acronyms for this list are on page 24. 
 
Access to Firearms 
 
• All non-crew EFF being considered for work need to submit an EFF Application 
annually so hiring personnel can tell if further action is warranted based on answers 
provided.  
• All incumbents of positions in the warehouse or as drivers need to annually submit the 
Qualification Inquiry – Firearm Possession form. See pages 28 & 29. 
 
Note:  Firearms Inquiry Forms should be accompanied by the definition of “misdemeanor crime of 
domestic violence”, Select Portions of Title 18 United States Code – page 30. 
 
Hours of Work 
 
EFF are hired as temporary emergency workers in response to hazardous wildfire situations.  
The State does not guarantee the length of employment, working schedules, or number of 
hours per day.  EFF crews will be paid for no less than eight hours of work per day except 
for the first and last day of an assignment, mandatory day off, or when being terminated.  
Non-crew EFF have no similar guarantee.  
 
Timesheets and Pay - See Incident Payroll, Chapter 2. 
 
EFF Employment Information  
 
General information about the EFF program,  as well as an information packet and 
application for non-crew positions, can be found at http://forestry.alaska.gov/employ.htm.

Alaska Job Center 
 
Different Alaska Job Center Offices throughout the state offer varying levels of assistance.  
DOF is responsible for coordinating with local Job Center offices to develop procedures for 
referring and recruiting applicants during fire season for their Area. 
 
Non-crew EFF hires must be made through Alaska Job Center whenever possible.  Area or 
Regional offices can hire from applications previously collected by Job Center and 
forwarded to Forestry in lieu of contacting Job Center first each time.  All DOF offices will 
use a standardized employment application (BLM or DNR Emergency Firefighter or 
Incident Support Worker form, see page 8). 
 
Previously employed EFF recommended for rehire with acceptable performance ratings may 
either be name requested from Alaska Job Center or contacted directly because of fire 
operational needs.  Some Alaska Job Center offices only accept applications for a specific 
time period.  Others do so constantly.  Employment-related telephone inquiries from 
perspective non-crew EFF should be referred to the nearest Alaska Job Center Office 
provided the Job Center is accepting applications.  If not, an application can be filled out 
and kept on file in case hiring needs occur.  
 
If completed Job Center applications aren’t at hand, regular job orders can be placed by 
phone for EFF, but minimum job qualifications and titles must be given to Alaska Job 
Center in order for them to provide qualified applicants. 
 
The hiring supervisor will notify Alaska Job Center when a referral is hired from their list of 
applicants. 
 
Alternate Hiring Procedures 
 
Applications will be available at each DOF office and Alaska Job Center.  Nothing in this 
procedure prohibits hiring of additional workers when Alaska Job Center is unavailable such 
as weekends, holidays, or after hours.   
 
To support equitable hiring practices, documentation of all attempts, both successful and 
unsuccessful, to contact applicants by phone are recorded on their application or on a 
contact log, noting date, time of call, and the name of the person making the call.  Logs and 
applications will be kept on file for 2 years by the Area or Regional Admin. 
 
Requesting a Non-crew EFF 
 
All EFF hires will be initiated and documented on a Resource Order. 
 
Requests for non-crew EFF will be made from the appropriate choice from the List of 
Approved EFF Classifications (page 7) on a General Message Form to the State Logistics 
Center or respective Area Dispatch Office for processing with the following information: 
 
 
2009 
Chapter 1 – Emergency Firefighter Hiring 
2 
ALASKA DEPARTMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES 
DIVISION OF FORESTRY 
ALASKA INCIDENT BUSINESS MANAGEMENT HANDBOOK 
 
• Non-crew EFF position requested  
• Requirements for job (e.g., Driver must have a current driver’s license) 
• Name if a rehire  
• Expected start date and beginning time 
• Whether they need to be fully qualified or if a trainee is acceptable 
• Reporting location 
• Any other special instructions  
 
State Logistics or the Area Dispatch will generate a resource order and fill the request. 
 
Felony and Misdemeanor Convictions for Non-crew EFF 
 
When applications reveal a misdemeanor conviction within the preceding five years, or a 
felony conviction regardless of the date it occurred (2 AAC 07.091), a hiring supervisor or 
manager may not make a job offer without DOA Human Resources’ review of the 
conviction information and duties of the position.  A hiring supervisor or manager who has 
knowledge of a conviction will report the information to Human Resources at the time of 
EFF hiring need.   
 
Classification of EFF 
 
Anyone not fully qualified is considered a trainee, and will be paid one level lower than a 
fully ICS-qualified individual. 
 
Applicants will be hired and paid at the appropriate EFF classification according to 
the current EFF List of Approved Classifications (page 7).  Hiring offices will work with 
their Regional Admin Officers to determine appropriate pay rate of EFF positions not shown 
on the List of Approved EFF Classifications.  If the work assignment changes, the worker’s 
classification and pay will be appropriately changed to reflect the new duties.  Any 
incidental changes in assignment that cause a rate change must be documented on the crew 
time report.  Permanent or long term changes require a new resource order. 
 
At no time will an EFF, regardless of length of service or qualifications, be paid at a 
higher rate than the assigned work requires.

point regardless of when transportation actually arrives to pick them up.  The Crew Boss, or

extra duties associated with crew management.

is responsible for the hiring forms reaching the administrative unit in the hiring Area.  The 
Crew Boss or Crew Representative is responsible for getting the time reports, CTR book, 
and Passenger and Cargo Manifest to the incident Finance Section, or when applicable, to 
the Area Office.
