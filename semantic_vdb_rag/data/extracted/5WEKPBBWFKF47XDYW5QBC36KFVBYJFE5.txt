posed to be obligated are to be derived and
the amount of the proposed obligation; and
(B) the activities and forms of assistance
for which the Secretary of Defense plans to
obligate such funds.
(2) Not later than 30 days after the end of
each quarter of fiscal years 1993 and 1994, the
Secretary of Defense, in coordination with
the Secretary of Energy, shall transmit to
the committees of Congress named in sub-

SEC. 1206. SOVIET WEAPONS DESTRUCTION.
(a) FINDINGS.—The Congress finds—
(1) that programs established under the So-
viet Nuclear Threat Reduction Act of 1991
(title II of Public Law 102–228) will contrib-
ute significantly to the destruction of weap-
ons of mass destruction of the states of the
former Soviet Union and the reduction of the
threat from such weapons and the potential
for their proliferation;
(2) that it is in the national security inter-
ests of the United States to continue to re-
duce the threats from the huge weapons ar-
senals of the former Soviet Union and to pro-
tect against the potential proliferation of
these weapons and the materials removed
from them, as well as the potential hazards
resulting from the faulty storage of those
weapons or materials; and
(3) that the threats to nuclear safety and
security described in section 211 of the So-
viet Nuclear Threat Reduction Act of 1991
(title II of Public Law 102–228; 105 Stat. 1693)
remain of urgent concern and that additional
resources 
are 
necessary 
to 
meet 
these
threats, particularly in areas such as safe
and secure storage of fissile material, dis-
mantlement of missiles and launchers, and
the destruction of chemical weapons.
(b) ADDITIONAL FUNDING.—(1) Section 221(a)
of the Soviet Nuclear Threat Reduction Act
of 1991 (title II of Public Law 102–228; 105
Stat. 1695) is amended by striking out
‘‘$400,000,000’’ and inserting in lieu thereof
‘‘$650,000,000’’.
(2) Section 221(e) of such Act is amended—
(A) by inserting ‘‘for fiscal year 1992 or fis-
cal year 1993’’ after ‘‘under part B’’;
(B) by inserting ‘‘for that fiscal year’’ after
‘‘for that program’’; and
