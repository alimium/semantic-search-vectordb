A As part of its responsibilities to optimize the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of its provision 
of the Services, the Vendor shall commit to and actively support the Benefits Realization (BR) 
Program to identify, measure, and increase the benefits accruing to the Commonwealth and the 
Vendor, associated with the Services, without adversely affecting the Service Levels and 
without increase in overall cost to the Commonwealth.  As a result of the Agreement, benefits 
such as service enhancement, cost reduction, and improved staff opportunities and service 
delivery are expected. In addition, the Agreement will also contribute to the economic 
development of the Commonwealth of Virginia.  These benefits will not only be achieved 
through the implementation of the Agreement, but also through the identification and 
implementation of new initiatives. 
The BR team is a joint team composed of dedicated VITA and Vendor Staff.  The BR team has 
responsibility for establishing the processes to quantify, measure, track, and document all such 
benefits realized through the Agreement. In addition, the team has responsibility for enhancing 
and increasing the benefits associated with the Agreement through the identification of cost 
improvement opportunities, value enhancement, and innovation.   
 
Staff dedicated to this program will include subject matter experts and senior level personnel 
with decision making authority sufficient to participate in collaborative programs and identify 
mutual business enhancement opportunities.  To help ensure effective development and 
creation of the necessary team skills and knowledge, the Vendor acknowledges that this BR 
Program will require a significant commitment to joint training of the Vendor and VITA team 
members in a collaborative work team.
