Updated January 24, 2007 – Next Update, January 31, 2007 
 
The PUCO produces the Apples to Apples charts to provide consumers with a snapshot comparison of current 
natural gas supplier price options and contract terms. The PUCO updates the charts on a regular basis and 
verifies each supplier offer to ensure accuracy. The chart below lists only the certified suppliers that are 
actively enrolling new customers. As with all contracts, consumers should carefully read and understand all 
terms and conditions before signing any forms or agreeing to enroll with a supplier for natural gas service. 
 
The PUCO provides the tools you need to calculate your estimated cost. The self-calculation worksheet 
following the chart below walks you through the steps needed to manually calculate your own estimated cost. 
You can also visit www.PUCO.ohio.gov and click on the Apples to Apples link to access our interactive 
calculator and automatically calculate your estimated costs. 
 
Vectren Energy Delivery of Ohio’s Rate  
Vectren Energy Delivery’s (Vectren) current total rate is $1.09647 per hundred cubic feet (Ccf), effective from 
January 1, 2007 to January 31, 2007. This includes a Gas Cost Recovery (GCR) rate of $0.88321 per Ccf, a 
gross receipts tax of $0.04307 per Ccf, and transportation costs of $0.17019 per Ccf. Vectren’s GCR rate 
varies each month and provides a dollar-for-dollar recovery of costs incurred by the local utility to purchase 
natural gas. The GCR rate allows the local utility to correct any over or under collections of natural gas costs 
from previous periods if the actual cost is different than the estimate. Contact information for Vectren Energy

Chart Definitions 
 
Ccf: One hundred cubic feet; a unit used to measure natural 
gas usage.  
 
Contract Term: The length or duration of the contract (i.e. 
monthly, yearly, multiple-year).  
 
County Sales Tax: When natural gas is purchased from a 
supplier, the natural gas is subject to Ohio sales or use tax. 
Because county sales tax rates vary throughout Ohio, the 
county sales tax is not included in the supplier’s total rate. 
Use the attached map to determine your county’s sales tax 
rate. 
 
Current Offer: Comprised of suppliers’ current commodity 
options and base rates, exclusive of sales tax, the local utility 
transportation charge, and customer service charges. 
Commodity options may be a fixed, variable, or stable rate 
plan.  
 
Expected Gas Cost (EGC): A component of the GCR, the EGC is the price the local utility expects to pay for natural gas 
in the upcoming GCR rate period. For example, if the GCR rate is filed on a monthly basis, the local utility will calculate 
the EGC for the following month. Gas costs recoverable through the EGC include the cost of purchasing the gas itself as 
well as the cost of transporting the gas from the producing region to the local utility’s service territory through the interstate 
pipeline system. 
 
Fixed Rate Plan: A constant rate for the contracted period. 
 
Gas Cost Recovery (GCR) Rate: A mechanism that provides a dollar-for-dollar recovery of costs incurred by a local 
utility to purchase natural gas to its system. The GCR mechanism enables the local utility to correct any over or under 
collections of natural gas costs in previous periods. 
 
GCR Transition (GCRT) Rider: An adjustment used to reimburse or charge customers for any under or over recovery of 
previous year’s gas cost charges. Although all customers are assessed a transportation rate charge, following 12 month’s 
participation as a CHOICE customer, the GCR transition rider is eliminated from the customer’s bill. Because the GCR 
transition rider only impacts the transportation charges of CHOICE customers of less than 12 month's participation, the 
total rate is calculated with these customers in mind.  
 
Gross Receipts Tax: When natural gas is purchased from a local utility, it is not subject to Ohio sales or use tax. The 
local utility must pay a gross receipts excise tax which is included in the GCR rate charged for the natural gas based on 
the volume of gas consumed (per Ccf). 
 
Stable Rate Plan: A variable rate for a fixed period of time. 
 
Supplier Name: PUCO-certified suppliers that are actively enrolling new customers.  
 
Total Rate: Comprised of the supplier’s natural gas commodity prices, plus the transportation rate charge.  
 
Transportation Rate Charge: The transportation rate charge, which can fluctuate quarterly, is comprised of a base rate, 
transportation program cost, migration rider, Percentage of Income Payment Plan rider, excise tax rider, uncollectible 
expense rider, GCR transition rider, and gross receipts excise tax. 
 
Variable Rate Plan: A fluctuating rate within the contracted period.

Self-Calculation Worksheet 
This self-calculation worksheet will provide you with an estimate of your monthly natural gas costs, based on your average 
monthly gas usage, current supplier price, transportation and service charges, and local sales tax. You may also wish to 
visit www.PUCO.ohio.gov to access our interactive Apples to Apples calculator.
