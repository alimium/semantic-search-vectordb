1.1 ­
NASA requirements for protecting the security of NASA information and information systems are derived from 
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) guidance. Information System Owners (ISOs) and other 
personnel responsible for the protection of NASA information or information systems shall follow NIST guidance in 
the proper security categorization (Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) 199, Standards for Security 
Categorization for Federal Information and Information Systems), and in the selection and implementation of 
information security controls (FIPS 200, Minimum Security Requirements for Federal Information and Information 
Systems and NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-53, Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems 
and Organizations), in a manner consistent with the Risk Management Framework (NIST SP 800-37, Guide for 
Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems). 
1.2 ­
This handbook augments NIST guidance by providing NASA-specific requirements, procedures and 
recommendations, where applicable. NASA-specific guidance does not negate NIST guidance, unless explicitly 
stated. 
1.3 ­
NASA Policy Directive (NPD) 2810.1, NASA Information Security Policy, NASA Procedural Requirements (NPR) 
2810.1, Security of Information Technology, and the collection of 2810 Information Technology Handbooks (ITS-
HBK) satisfy the policy and procedure controls of NIST SP 800-53, Recommended Security Controls for Federal 
Information Systems and Organizations. 
1.4 ­
NPR 2810.1, Security of Information Technology, designates this handbook as a guide of NASA’s Security 
Assessment and Authorization (CA) information security controls. 
1.5 ­
The terms “shall” and “may” within this handbook are used as defined in ITS-HBK-0001, Format and Procedures for 
IT Security Policies and Handbooks. 
1.6 ­
The Security Assessment and Authorization control family relates to the activities and requirements surrounding 
the routine testing of security controls, the continuous monitoring of system security posture, and the ongoing 
risk-based decisions to approve or deny the use of a system. Officials within the NASA community are responsible 
for continuously ensuring the effectiveness of security control implementations throughout the life cycle of a 
system. Moreover, in light of an ever-changing security landscape, designated NASA officials should always be 
prepared to determine the impact of a system’s operation on the success of the NASA mission.

Section: Values in this column indicate whether an organizationally defined value is in the main body of the control (Main), or part of one of the control’s enhancements 
(E1, E2, etc). 
•  
Parameter: Sometimes, a specific Section may have multiple organizationally defined values. In those instances, the bracketed number Parameters indicate which 
organizationally defined value (numbered sequentially) is being referenced. In the case of nested organizationally defined values, a series of bracketed numbers is 
used.
