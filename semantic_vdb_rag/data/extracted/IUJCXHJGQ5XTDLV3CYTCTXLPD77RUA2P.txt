Parking near the Court of Appeals
        There are practically no public meters on the four streets bordering the federal buildings: Poydras,
Camp, Magazine and Capdeville. There are public meters near the area, but they are hard to find and
expensive for long term - you’ll need lots of change! 
        The city quickly tows illegally parked cars;  you may not get a warning ticket. Impound-towing fees
are very expensive and it can take hours to retrieve your car. W e don’t want that to happen to you, so we
made this list!
