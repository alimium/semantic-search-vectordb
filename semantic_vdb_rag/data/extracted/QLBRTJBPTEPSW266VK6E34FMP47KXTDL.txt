Medicare-Approved Drug Discount Card Tip Sheet
Are you helping someone with Medicare compare 
drug discount cards? Start Here.
STEP 1: Know the Basics
•
What? Two new options for people with Medicare: (1) Medicare-approved drug discount cards 
and (2) a $600 credit to pay for prescriptions.
•
Who? Cards are for anyone with Medicare, except people who already have drug coverage from 
Medicaid. The $600 credit is for people with a card who have lower incomes.
•
When? Enrollment starts May 2004. Cards can be used as early as June 2004. Program lasts until 
December 31, 2005.
•
Why? To save money on prescription drugs.
•
How? People with Medicare compare discount cards with a Medicare-approved seal on them, 
which are offered by private companies. They can choose a card that offers the best discounts on 
the drugs they need. Cost for enrolling varies by card, but is no more than $30 per year. If eligible
for the $600 credit, enrolling is free.
STEP 2: Get Personal
Fill out the information on the back of this sheet, paying special attention to the tips. If the person isn’t able
to answer some of the questions, give him or her time to gather the information before moving on to Step 3.
STEP 3: Find Card Options
If you have access to a computer, go to www.medicare.gov and click on “Prescription Drug and Other
Assistance Programs.” Use the information you collected on the back of this sheet to answer the 
questions and learn about the drug discount cards (and other options) that are available to the person you
are helping. If you don’t have a computer, call 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227) instead. The opera-
tor will walk you through these questions and mail you a list of options.
STEP 4: Compare Cards
Compare what each card offers to find the one that best meets this person’s needs. Some things to consider:
•
Look for the Medicare-approved seal. Keep in mind that a person can have only one Medicare-
approved discount card. The $600 credit (if the person is eligible) can only be applied to a 
Medicare-approved discount card.
•
If the person needs multiple drugs, check total savings and savings by drug. Sometimes the best 
card won’t discount every drug the person needs, but could provide bigger discounts on his or her 
most expensive drugs. Generic alternatives for brand-name drugs might also provide the best savings.
•
If the person is loyal to a particular pharmacy, look for a card that includes that pharmacy.
•
If the person has addresses in more than one state or near a state border, look for a card with a 
national service area.
STEP 5: Enroll in a Card
Once the person determines the best card, he or she will need to fill out an enrollment form. Enrollment
forms for Medicare-approved drug discount cards are available from the private company that offers the
card. If the person applies for the card and the $600 credit, he or she will need to mail or 
fax a copy of the enrollment form with a signature. Some plans are able to enroll people over 
the telephone.
