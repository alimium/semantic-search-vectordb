the Regional Director;

opinion of counsel in support of its representations 
that the state law requirements 
referred to in 12 U.S.C. 5 1464(r)(2)(C) are satisfied with respect to each of the four 
states in which it is acquiring branches. To be acceptable, the opinion must, at a

is being rendered and who has substantial experience 
and background 
in the 
interpretation 
and application 
of state banking law;
