Meeting with Agriculture Secretary to Discuss Continued Farm Bill Delays�
�
�
 �
�
�
On Wednesday, I met with Secretary of Agriculture Ed Shafer. This was my first time visiting with Secretary Shafer, who
took over as head of USDA in January. I took the opportunity to discuss the lack of progress on the farm bill and ideas
that would speed up passage of a bill. The Secretary and I agree that as spring planting begins and summer harvest
approaches, farmers need to know what type of farm policy they will be operating under in the current crop year.�
�
�
 �
�
�
Late this week, a preliminary framework was agreed to by the Chairmen and Ranking Members of the House and Senate
Agriculture Committee. We will know more about the framework as it is discussed in conference meetings over the course
of the next several days, but from what I can tell, the priorities in this farm bill certainly do not reflect those of farmers and
ranchers. Funding is being redirected out of programs that support producers and into non-agricultural programs. This is
further evidence of movement in a direction that is less friendly to farmers in Kansas and the small towns they live in. As
a member of the conference committee, I will be working to protect direct payments and the viability of crop insurance.
Because a bill was not passed this week, the farm bill was extended an additional week.�

Voting to Delay Medicaid Regulations�
�
�
 �
�
�
The House approved legislation this week to delay the implementation of seven Medicaid regulations for one year.
Medicaid is a joint federal-state health insurance program for the poor. I am concerned these seven regulations would
push more Medicaid costs on the states, narrow certain services provided by Medicaid and limit some state services
eligible for federal reimbursements. Without congressional action to delay these new administrative rules, Kansas and
other states would be forced to pay for more of the health care costs associated with Medicaid. This legislation now goes
to the Senate for consideration.�

Veterans' Benefits Bills Approved�
�
�
 �
�
�
I participated in a Veterans' Affairs Subcommittee on Economic Opportunity hearing this week that approved several
veterans' measures regarding housing, education and other benefits. The Subcommittee agreed to the Veterans
Education Improvement Act, a bill to improve veterans' educational benefits and modernize the Montgomery G.I. Bill.
This bill is the product of a series of Subcommittee hearings conducted since the beginning of last year to evaluate the
G.I. Bill and explore improvements. The G.I. Bill should be updated, both to recognize the increased role of our Guard
and Reserve members and to ensure that all veterans have the resources to attend school when they return from
service. I am hopeful Congress will act soon to modernize the G.I. Bill.�

Discussing our Nation's Rail Infrastructure �
�
�
 �
�
�
On Wednesday, I attended a Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee on Railroads hearing to discuss rail
capacity for our nation's railroads. Freight railroads currently move more than 40 percent of our nation's freight. The
increase in demand for freight services is threatening to overload the current capacity of America's rail infrastructure.
Much of the investment in rail infrastructure is made by the railroads themselves. During the hearing, we listened to
various ideas on improving the amount of railroad track available throughout the country. �

Testing New Vehicle Technology on Earth Day�
�
�
 �
�
�
Around the world on Tuesday, people marked Earth Day by taking time to consider ways to improve and protect our
environment. I had the opportunity to test drive a plug-in hybrid electric car. With new advances in technology, these cars
offer hope for reducing our dependence on foreign oil, cleaning up the environment and lowering fuel costs for American
consumers. Plug-in hybrids can be recharged in standard electrical outlets and driven up to 60 miles without the use of
gasoline. Statistics show the average American commutes 40 miles round trip each day. This technology would allow
such a person to drive all day without using any gas.�
�
�
 �
�
�
Our foreign policy is distorted because of our reliance on oil from other countries. Switching to new forms of
transportation that run on electricity or renewable fuels will make our country more secure and should help Kansans
struggling to afford gas for their vehicles.�

Senate Reaches Deal on FAA Bill�
�
�
 �
�
�
As more Americans travel by air, our nation's aging aviation infrastructure system becomes even more strained. We
need a modern air traffic control system that can handle the increase in passengers in a safe and efficient manner. In
September, I supported House passage of legislation to modernize the air traffic control system and fund the Federal
Aviation Administration (FAA) through 2011. While this bill passed the House, it had been stalled in the Senate. This
week, an agreement was reached that will bring this bill to a vote in the next few days. Importantly, the Senate
agreement does not include user-fees on general aviation. I worked successfully in the House to defeat a similar
proposal that would have increased general aviation user fees. Many of the general aviation aircraft and parts are made
in Kansas and this user fee proposal would have harmed the local and state economy, as well as individual pilots across
the state. �

Attending the Kansas State Society Cherry Blossom Banquet�
�
�
 �
�
�
On Tuesday, I joined Kansans for the annual Kansas Society of Washington, D.C., Cherry Blossom Banquet. The event
in D.C. was a great opportunity to meet many Kansans who work in our nation's capital to preserve our way of life back
home. I was honored to introduce the 2008 Kansan of the Year, Kroger Chairman and CEO Dave Dillon. Dillon was
recognized for his leadership in working to rebuild the Dillons/KWIK Shop convenience and grocery store in Greensburg
following the deadly tornado last year. Dillon's great-grandfather, J.S. Dillon, opened the first Dillon's grocery store in
Hutchinson nearly a century ago. Congratulations also to the 2008 Kansas Cherry Blossom Princess Justine Sterling,
originally of Kiowa. �

I visited the Lewis and Clark Center at Fort Leavenworth this week. This was my first visit to the Lewis and Clark Center
since its opening in August 2007. The Lewis and Clark Center is the new home for the Command and General Staff
College, which serves as a graduate school for approximately 1,200 Army majors and international military leaders.
Following a tour of the facility, I met with Lieutenant General William Caldwell and State Representative Kenny Wilk.

Visiting Children's Mercy Hospital in Kansas City �
�
�
 �
�
�
En route back to Washington, D.C., this week, I visited Children's Mercy Hospital in Kansas City for a tour of the hospital
and to meet with members of the staff and Board of Directors. Children's Mercy Hospital is a comprehensive pediatric
medical center and is ranked as one of the leading children's hospitals in the nation. It is the only Level I Pediatric
Trauma Center located between St. Louis and Denver. Medical professionals provide care for children from birth to age
18. �
�
�
 �
�
�
I was impressed with the family-centered environment and the care they not only provide to the child, but also the
support available for the families. The hospital staff shared with me several interesting statistics, including the fact that
nearly one-fourth of all Kansas children admitted to any hospital are admitted to Children's Mercy. In 2007, Children's
Mercy provided care for children from 101 of the 105 Kansas counties. Children's Mercy also operates a primary care
clinic in Wyandotte County, a full service general pediatrics hospital in Overland Park and has outreach clinics in Hays,
Manhattan, Pittsburg, Salina, Wichita and Junction City. Click here to view photos from my visit. �

fixture in the community for years and was scheduled to close until Gary decided to keep the store open.�
