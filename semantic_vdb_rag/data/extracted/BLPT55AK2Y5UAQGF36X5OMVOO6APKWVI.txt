SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
regulations. Command-and-control
requirements specify, often in great
detail, how a plant is to achieve
particular food safety or other regulatory
objectives, while performance standards
state the objectives or levels of
performance to be achieved and give a
plant the ability to describe how it will
achieve them. Included in the Agency’s
review are regulations on sanitation,
meat and poultry products with visible
defects affecting safety or quality, and
economic adulteration of meat and
poultry products.
FSIS announced its regulatory review
in a December 29, 1995, advance notice
of proposed rulemaking (ANPR) ‘‘FSIS
Agenda for Change’’ (60 FR 67469). The
Agency said that, by eliminating
unnecessary regulations and replacing
command-and-control prescriptions
with performance standards, inspected
establishments would have greater
flexibility to adopt innovations that can
yield food-safety benefits. Among the
regulations FSIS has identified as
candidates for modification or
elimination are those that delimit
processing and treatment methods
intended to eliminate specific food
safety hazards and requirements
concerning quality control programs.
FSIS has already reduced its role of
approving and specifying in detail the
design and operation of establishment-
operated partial quality control (PQC)
programs. In 1997, the Agency
published a final rule that, among other
things, removes the requirement for
FSIS prior approval of most PQC
programs (62 FR 45016, August 25,
1997). Recognizing that the
establishment bears primary
responsibility for the control of its own
manufacturing processes, FSIS now
thinks it appropriate to take the further
step of eliminating PQC requirements
other than for irradiation of poultry (9
CFR 381.149(b)), so that establishments
will have the flexibility they need to be
innovative, and consistent with HACCP
and the Agency’s regulatory policy.
(FSIS proposed to remove requirements
for quality control programs for poultry-
product irradiation in its February 24,
1999, proposal on the irradiation of
meat and meat products (64 FR 9809).)
Quality Control
Quality control, in general, is a
planned, documented system of
activities intended to ensure the
SUMMARY: The Food Safety and
Inspection Service (FSIS) is proposing
to amend the meat and poultry products
inspection regulations by removing the
requirements pertaining to partial
quality control (PQC) programs except
with respect to the irradiation of poultry
products. A PQC program controls a
single product, operation, or part of an
operation in a meat or poultry
establishment. The proposal would
remove the design requirements for PQC
programs and the requirements for
establishments to have PQC programs
for certain products or processes, other
than those that apply to irradiation of
poultry products. For example, the
proposal would remove the
requirements for poultry slaughtering
establishments operating under the New
Line Speed (NELS) inspection system
and the New Turkey Inspection System
(NTIS) to have PQC programs and the
requirements concerning the design,
content, and Agency approval of those
programs. The proposal would also
remove from the thermal processing
regulations the requirements for FSIS
prior approval of systems and devices
not specified in the regulations and all
requirements concerning PQC programs.
The proposal would expand the
alternatives available to establishments
under the thermal processing
regulations for ensuring the safety of
their products. This proposal is
intended to provide inspected
establishments with flexibility, to make
the regulations more consistent with the
Background
FSIS carries out programs designed to
ensure that meat, poultry, and egg
products are wholesome, not
adulterated, and properly marked,
labeled, and packaged. FSIS is
implementing the ‘‘Pathogen Reduction;
Hazard Analysis and Critical Control
Point (HACCP) Systems’’ final rule
published July 25, 1996 (61 FR 38806),
to reduce the risk of foodborne illness
associated with the consumption of
meat and poultry products to the
maximum extent possible. The Pathogen
Reduction (PR)/HACCP final rule
requires establishments to take
appropriate and feasible measures to
prevent or reduce the likelihood of
physical, chemical, and microbiological
hazards in the production of meat and
poultry products.
FSIS is reviewing its other regulations
to determine how they can be made
more consistent with the PR/HACCP
regulations and the regulatory approach
they embody. This approach favors
performance-based standards over
prescriptive, command-and-control
26893
Federal Register / Vol. 64, No. 95 / Tuesday, May 18, 1999 / Proposed Rules
Proposed Changes
prevent the marketing of products that
are misbranded or that lack the quality
or value that consumers expect. A plant
operating under a PQC program for net
weight keeps records of its checks and
corrective actions to avoid lot
inspection. Under PQC programs for fat
and water in frankfurters, plants keep
ingredient records by lot and results of
laboratory tests for verification by FSIS
inspectors. A plant operating a PQC
program for boneless meat inspection
does its own on-line inspection and
keeps records. The FSIS inspector
randomly selects samples of product
that the plant has already inspected to
ensure that the records are accurate.
Establishments are required by
current regulations to have PQC
programs for certain products or
processes, such as the one for MS(S),
just mentioned. A PQC program for on-
line carcass quality control is required
for an establishment operating under
either the NELS or the NTIS poultry
inspection system (9 CFR 381.76(c)).
PQC Programs in Slaughtering Plants
FSIS is proposing to eliminate the
requirement in 9 CFR 317.21(b) that
establishments have, as an alternative to
State or local certification of scales, PQC
programs or total quality control system
provisions for checking the accuracy of
scales. The Agency is proposing simply
to require that there be a certification of
accuracy from State or local authorities
or from a State-registered or -licensed
scale repair firm or person.
Establishments could continue to
maintain scale-checking provisions in
their QC programs and systems.
The Agency is proposing to remove
from the meat and poultry inspection
regulations the design requirements for
partial quality control programs (9 CFR
318.4(d), 381.145(d)). The provisions
outline what is necessary when an
establishment is required to have a PQC
program. Because the Agency is
proposing to revoke the regulatory
requirements pertaining to PQC
programs, there is no need to describe
what is necessary when PQC is
required.
FSIS would also remove quality
control requirements (9 CFR 318.7)
governing the use of nitrites in bacon
curing and the use of certain organic
acids singly or in combination to delay
the discoloration of fresh meat cuts.
Such requirements are incompatible
with the Agency’s regulatory objectives
because they specify a manner of
compliance rather than simply a
performance standard.
Both the nitrite and the organic acid
regulations clearly state the maximum
limits of use of the substances they
concern. The consumer is also informed
by product labeling of the presence of
the substances in the products. The
regulations provide clear limits and
adequate consumer protections without
the quality control requirements. The
Agency is also proposing to improve the
accuracy of the regulation by using the
term ‘‘production of botulinum toxin’’
rather than ‘‘growth of botulinum toxin’’
(see 9 CFR 318.7(b)(3)(ii)). FSIS is aware
that these food-safety regulations also
may be regarded as inconsistent with
the PR/HACCP regulations, but the
Agency would prefer to address this
inconsistency in a future rulemaking.
The Agency proposes to make the
meat and poultry canning regulations (9
CFR 318.305 and 381.305) more
consistent with the Agency’s new, non-
command-and-control regulatory
approach by eliminating a number of
prior-approval requirements. First, the
requirement that the Agency prior-
approve temperature-indicating devices
other than mercury-in-glass
The Agency conducts verification
checks on the plant-operated PQC
programs required for certain inspection
systems. Establishments being
considered for implementation of the
NELS and NTIS inspection systems
(currently, about 10 per year) must meet
requirements both for facilities and for
PQC programs.
Interested establishments are required
to obtain FSIS approval of their PQC
programs before the programs can be
implemented on a trial basis.
Unacceptable PQC programs are
returned to the establishment for
correction.
Once approved, PQC programs are
subject to on-site review by the Agency
for six months after implementation.
The establishment then submits an
updated PQC program to the Agency for
final review. If, at that stage, the
program is found to be acceptable, full
approval is granted, although the
establishment remains subject to
Agency verification checks. If the
program is unacceptable, the trial period
may be extended or approval of the
program may be withdrawn.
The Agency provides guidelines to
help interested establishments prepare
for implementation of the NELS and
NTIS inspection systems. Instructions
for developing PQC programs are
included in those guidelines. The
Agency also offers instruction on
slaughter quality control programs to
Government and industry personnel at
the FSIS Training Center.
stability of processes and uniformity of
products. Quality control programs and
systems are based on the assumption
that there is normal variation in any
process, and that the process is under
control if that variation is not exceeded.
In the food industry, quality control
systems are used in processing
operations to make sure that products
from TV dinners to hotdogs will be
exactly the same—will have the same
content, flavor, color, texture, etc.—no
matter how many thousands are made
in a production run. Quality control
programs can be used to maintain
normal process variation within the
limits prescribed in a standard, such as
the 50-percent-fat limitation in a
breakfast sausage. If the expected
variation is exceeded, corrective action
is taken to restore process stability.
Under FSIS regulations, a company
may choose to place all of the processes
and products in a plant under a
comprehensive, or total, quality control
system, or the company may choose to
place only individual products or
processes under quality control. A
quality control program for only one
process or product in a plant is known
as a partial quality control (PQC)
program.
Some PQC programs control product
potential health and safety problems;
others focus on economic or quality
factors. PQC programs controlling for
safety factors include those for
thermally processed products, which
are intended primarily to prevent toxin
formation in the processed product. The
programs for cooked beef products are
intended to ensure that the processing
of the products meets the regulatory
requirements for handling, processing
(time, temperature, and relative
humidity), and storage to prevent
pathogen formation in the products.
PQC programs that control for product
safety have been largely superseded by
required HACCP plans.
PQC programs that control for
economic or non-food-safety factors
include those used to control the fat and
water content of hotdogs, the number of
meatballs in, or pepperoni slices on, a
product, and the moisture or protein-fat-
free (PFF) content of a product labeled
‘‘ham, water added.’’ The quality
control program for mechanically
separated (species) (MS(S)) is intended
to control bone particle size, calcium
content, fat and protein content, and
protein efficiency ratio (9 CFR 319.5).
The programs for pressed ham and
spiced ham products are intended to
ensure that the products meet the PFF
regulatory requirements of § 319.104.
PQC programs to control products for
economic factors are intended to
26894
Federal Register / Vol. 64, No. 95 / Tuesday, May 18, 1999 / Proposed Rules
corrective actions to be taken,
recordkeeping, or monitoring
procedures, that would be followed
when process deviations occurred. They
could also include partial quality
control programs, developed by or for
the establishment, but not subject to
FSIS approval. Such food-safety-related
PQC programs would, however, be
superseded by or integrated with
provisions of the establishment’s
HACCP plan when that plan is
implemented.
Similarly, under this proposal, a
thermal processing establishment would
have four alternatives for handling
finished product inspections. The
finished product inspections could be
handled under: (1) The existing
regulations (§§ 318.309(d) and
381.309(d)); (2) a HACCP plan; (3) the
provisions of an approved total quality
control system, until the PR/HACCP
final rule is applicable to the
establishment; or (4) alternative
documented procedures for handling
finished product inspections. The
alternative documented procedures
could be PQC programs or the HACCP
plan provisions.
In any case, any alternative
procedures for handling process
deviations or finished product
inspections would have to ensure that
only safe, stable product is shipped in
commerce. This proposed requirement
dictates that not only would the
procedures have to ensure that the
product is free of microorganisms of
public health significance, but also that
it is not adulterated by other types of
microorganisms, such as ‘‘flat-sour’’
bacteria or other spoilage organisms.
This proposed requirement is consistent
with the aims of HACCP and with the
statutory prohibitions against the
distribution of adulterated and
misbranded meat and poultry products
in commerce.
The proposed amendments would
make the thermal processing regulations
more consistent with the PR/HACCP
final rule by explicitly providing a
HACCP-plan alternative to the
prescriptive procedures (consistent with
§ 417.2(b)(3)) and by including, as an
option for handling process deviations
or final product inspections, alternative
documented procedures that ensure that
only safe and stable products are
shipped in commerce. This option
would provide the establishment with
the flexibility to use PQC programs or
other procedures that meet a regulatory
public health standard.
It should be noted that, under the
HACCP regulations, an establishment’s
HACCP plan does not have to address
potential microbial hazards in thermally
processed/commercially sterile product
if the establishment is following the
current regulatory requirements for such
product. However, the HACCP plan
must address physical and chemical
hazards to which the product may be
subject.
Besides proposing to remove the
requirements pertaining to PQC
programs that control food-safety
factors, which are inconsistent with PR/
HACCP, FSIS is proposing to remove
the requirements affecting economic or
quality-related PQC programs. FSIS
considers these requirements to be too
prescriptive. They tend to perpetuate
the command-and-control approach to
food inspection and regulation. They are
not in keeping with the Agency’s new
regulatory approach, which is oriented
more toward monitoring industry
compliance with performance-related
objectives.
First, the Agency is proposing to
remove the QC system requirements
from the regulations and requirements
governing the identity and composition
of MS(S) product and label approval of
the product (9 CFR 319.5). The MS(S)
regulations specify the maximum
calcium content, the minimum protein
content, the protein efficiency ratio, the
maximum fat content, and the
maximum bone particle size for the
product. The regulations also specify
the elements that the QC system must
contain, including a written description
of the methods used by the
establishment to maintain uniformity of
raw materials used in manufacturing
product and to control handling and
processing of the raw materials and
finished product. The regulations also
specify the sample size and sampling
frequency for food-chemistry analysis of
product to determine compliance with
the standards. FSIS regards these
provisions as overly prescriptive and
believes that, to achieve the purposes of
the MS(S) regulations, it is sufficient to
set the product standards for fat,
protein, calcium content, and bone
particle size.
The Agency is also proposing to
update the provision for finished
product samples to be analyzed
according to methods of the Association
of Official Analytical Chemists (AOAC)
or methods listed in the FSIS
‘‘Chemistry Laboratory Guidebook’’ to
reflect use of the most recent edition of
the AOAC compendium. In addition,
FSIS is proposing to give establishments
the latitude to use validated scientific
methods equivalent to, but not listed in,
the AOAC and FSIS references. Under
this proposed action, the establishments
will have flexibility to choose the most
appropriate means of ensuring that
thermometers (at §§ 318.305(a)(1)(ii) and
381.305(a)(1)(ii)) would be replaced.
Temperature-indicating devices, such as
resistance temperature detectors, could
be used and, as is the case currently,
they would have to meet known
standards of accuracy for such devices,
but the frequency of testing for accuracy
would not be prescribed.
The Agency is also proposing to
remove the requirement for case-by-case
evaluation and approval by FSIS of
thermal processing systems not
specified in the regulations. As
amended, 9 CFR 318.305(f) and
381.305(f) would require that such
systems be adequate to produce shelf-
stable products consistently and
uniformly. These requirements reflect
the basic purposes of the canning
regulations.
FSIS is also proposing to remove from
the thermal processing regulations (9
CFR 318.307(b) and 381.307(b))
provisions concerning PQC programs
and requirements for FSIS prior
approval of thermal processing systems
not specified in the regulations,
including monitoring and recording
devices not specified in the regulations.
The Agency tentatively concludes that
these regulations will ensure the
adequacy of these systems without the
requirement that the Agency is
proposing to delete, which is
inconsistent with the PR/HACCP
regulations.
The Agency is also proposing to
remove from the thermal processing
regulations the requirements (in
§§ 318.308 and 309 and §§ 381.308 and
309) concerning partial quality control
programs to control process deviations
and establishment finished product
inspection procedures. The Agency
tentatively finds that these requirements
are unnecessary. The detailed
prescriptions in these sections, which
are based on HACCP principles, would
remain as acceptable protections against
potential microbial contamination.
Under this proposal, a thermal
processing establishment would have
four alternatives available to control
process deviations identified in-process.
The establishment could:
(1) Provide for how it will handle the
deviations under a HACCP plan; or,
until subject to 9 CFR part 417, (2)
follow the existing regulations
(§§ 318.308(d) and 381.308(d)); (3)
handle the deviations under an
approved total quality control system
until the PR/HACCP rule becomes
applicable to it; or (4) use alternative
documented procedures for handling
process deviations. The alternative
documented procedures could be
provisions of a HACCP plan, such as
26895
Federal Register / Vol. 64, No. 95 / Tuesday, May 18, 1999 / Proposed Rules
MS(S) meets the compositional and
labeling identity requirements of the
regulations, but they will also have the
burden of demonstrating equivalence.
The Agency is aware, however, that
some may disagree with the evaluation
of the MS(S) QC and analytical
requirements as overly prescriptive;
their comments on this matter are
invited. Others may regard the
incorporation by reference of the AOAC
methods as unnecessary and such
standards as those for fat content and
protein efficiency ratio as duplicative of
other regulatory requirements. Their
comments are invited as well.
Second, consistent with the other
changes proposed in this document,
FSIS is proposing to eliminate the
quality control program requirements
from the protein-fat-free (PFF)
percentage regulations (§§ 319.104 and
319.105) for various ‘‘finely divided’’
cured ham products, such as patties,
chopped or pressed ham, and spiced
ham. Establishments would still be
required to abide by the PFF percentage
limits for these products.
Finally, FSIS is proposing to remove
the requirement that poultry
slaughtering establishments operating
under the NELS and NTIS inspection
systems have PQC programs for carcass
defects. If this proposed change is
adopted, the establishments will have
the flexibility to adopt quality control
programs or other measures for ensuring
the quality of their products. Removing
the prior-approval aspect of these
requirements will contribute to
clarifying the respective roles of the
inspection service and the regulated
industry—a necessary task in making
the requirements consistent with
HACCP.
FSIS inspectors would continue to
check poultry in NELS and NTIS plants
for visible contamination and carcass
trimming defects.
The alternative of mandating new
general requirements or standards for
PQC programs would differ little in its
effects from the current requirements for
PQC programs to have certain features
and for process control under the
programs to be based on generally
accepted statistical principles (9 CFR
318.4(d); 381.145(d)). Even if the current
requirements were condensed, they
would still be inconsistent with the PR/
HACCP regulations and with the
Agency’s new regulatory approach,
establishments would continue to incur
a substantial recordkeeping burden, and
the Agency would have nearly the same
burden as it now does of verifying
establishment compliance with the
requirements.
FSIS chose the option of eliminating
regulatory requirements for all PQC
programs except QC programs for the
irradiation of poultry products. This
option provides establishments with the
most flexibility in implementing process
control programs in a HACCP
environment. FSIS’s proposed rule on
irradiation of meat and meat products
(64 FR 9089, February 24, 1999) would
eliminate the requirement for QC
programs in facilities where poultry
products are irradiated.
Implementation of this proposed rule
would enable FSIS to redirect resources
from PQC program verification to other
activities for ensuring that products are
not adulterated or misbranded. FSIS has
considered a number of alternatives to
PQC program verification, such as
finished product sampling for
microbiological or food chemistry
analysis and market sampling. Market
sampling or national surveys can be
used in lieu of inspecting lots or
evaluating PQC programs for fat and
water content of frankfurters. An
alternative to FSIS evaluation of PQC
programs for basting solutions in
poultry products is finished product
sampling for chemical analysis.
In-plant sampling of finished
products for chemical analysis is a tool
that FSIS has used—and will continue
to use—to determine whether products
are in compliance with regulatory
requirements and to verify the
effectiveness of in-plant controls. To be
most effective, such sampling and
analysis would be carried out in
conjunction with Agency HACCP-
verification and other verification
activities.
FSIS also regards market sampling as
a potentially useful tool for enforcing
the statutes prohibiting the distribution
in commerce of adulterated and
misbranded meat and poultry products
and for checking the effectiveness of
establishment process controls.
most PQC programs were eliminated.
This action was taken to facilitate the
transition to HACCP in official
establishments producing the greatest
portion of meat and poultry products
consumed in the United States. FSIS is
proposing to take the additional step of
eliminating most requirements for
establishments to have PQC programs
for specific products or processes, as
well as design requirements affecting
most PQC programs. The only PQC
program requirements this proposal
would leave in place would be the
requirement for QC programs for
irradiated chicken. However, as
mentioned previously, this requirement
is being addressed in another
rulemaking proceeding (64 FR 9809).
The alternatives to this proposed
rulemaking that FSIS considered were,
in addition to the alternative of no
rulemaking, those of mandating
additional in-plant controls and of
mandating general requirements and
standards for PQC programs.
The alternative of no rulemaking
would impose no additional regulatory
burdens on establishments, which
would continue to have the assurance
that their PQC programs meet basic
design criteria. However, the Agency
rejected this alternative because not
changing the regulations would leave in
place a prescriptive regulatory regime
for process controls and PQC programs
that conflict in a material way with the
objectives of the PR/HACCP final rule.
Under HACCP, establishments assume
responsibility for building science-
based, preventive process controls into
the food production system to reduce or
eliminate food safety hazards. This
includes taking responsibility for
ensuring that processes conform with
sound food safety performance
standards. Establishments need to be
able to implement better and more
innovative food-safety and other
consumer-protection strategies. This
includes the flexibility to design a PQC
program and determine its content and
implementation date.
The alternative of mandating
additional in-plant controls, whether in
addition to or in lieu of PQC
requirements, would add regulatory
assurances that processes are under
control and that products are safe,
wholesome, and not misbranded.
However, this alternative would add
prescriptive, command-and-control
requirements and restrict the scope for
establishment food-safety initiatives,
contradicting the Agency’s new
regulatory approach. The additional
requirements also would probably not
result in food-safety improvement.
Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory
Flexibility Act
This proposed rule has been
determined to be significant, though not
economically significant, and was
reviewed by the Office of Management
and Budget under Executive Order
12866.
FSIS is proposing to eliminate the
regulatory requirements pertaining to
establishment-operated PQC programs.
This action would remove regulatory
obstacles to innovation and command-
and-control requirements inconsistent
with the Agency’s new regulatory
approach and the objectives of the PR/
HACCP regulations. In its August 25,
1997, final rule (62 FR 45016), the
requirements for FSIS prior approval of
26896
Federal Register / Vol. 64, No. 95 / Tuesday, May 18, 1999 / Proposed Rules
260 hrs./yr./program X 1,852 programs),
add up to about $14 million in costs to
the regulated industry.
For most establishments, the proposal
would not yield immediate, direct
savings from removal of burdens
associated with developing PQC
programs because most PQC programs
are voluntarily adopted by
establishments. Establishments likely
would continue the use of QC methods
in their operations, so the removal of the
regulatory requirement for
establishments to follow the regulatory
design specifications would not
immediately yield a savings to
establishments. Further, a substantial
proportion of the costs of complying
with this regulation was removed with
the publication of the final rule
eliminating prior approvals for facilities,
equipment, and PQC programs (62 FR
45016; August 25, 1997).
However, FSIS currently requires that
if establishments adopt PQC programs,
the programs must meet certain design
specifications and must contain certain
specified information. Some
establishments that are required to have
PQC programs for certain products and
processes would benefit from the
removal of burdens associated with
developing PQC programs. These
establishments, including those
involved in producing MS(S), meat cuts
treated with organic acids, and other
processing, could benefit from shifting
some portion of their PQC program
development and operation costs into
HACCP-related or other activities.
Also, under the proposed regulatory
amendments, establishments would
have greater freedom to innovate. An
indeterminate proportion of the annual
burden of developing PQC programs
according to FSIS specifications could
eventually be channeled into more
efficient and effective use of industry
resources, especially where PQC
programs have been operated.
Thus, although there would not be a
direct savings from the removal of the
regulatory requirements governing PQC
programs, the industry potentially
would be able to make more efficient
and effective use of the $1 million or so
in annual costs of developing the
programs.
Finally, the proposed rule would
permit FSIS to reallocate field
inspection and headquarters resources
now used in oversight of establishment-
operated PQC programs to higher
priority food safety-related activities.
substantial number of small entities.
The proposal would affect about 72
poultry slaughtering establishments,
most of which are large business
enterprises. It also would affect as many
as 3,550 official meat and poultry
processing establishments, of which a
substantial majority, 3,330, are
considered small entities under Small
Business Administration criteria (500 or
fewer employees per establishment).
However, the proposal would not have
a significant effect on these
establishments. It would impose no new
regulatory requirements necessitating
investments or other resource
commitments by establishments but
would, by removing a number of
existing regulatory requirements, permit
more efficient resource utilization,
especially to support establishment
HACCP systems.
The proposal would remove most
remaining requirements for
establishments to have PQC programs
for certain products or processes and the
general requirement concerning the
design of such programs. The proposal
would give inspected establishments
greater flexibility to innovate and to
introduce new processes or products
that meet HACCP or other consumer
protection objectives. As a result, the
proposal would theoretically provide
several thousand dollars of regulatory
relief annually per establishment.
The proposal would enable
establishments to avoid the costs
associated with developing and
implementing PQC programs that
address regulatory requirements for the
use of certain substances in preparation
of meat and poultry products, such as
the use of organic acids to delay
discoloration of fresh meat cuts.
Thermal processing establishments (of
which there are about 130) would avoid
the costs associated with developing
PQC programs according to Agency
specifications and the costs associated
with obtaining Agency prior approvals.
As many as 3,330 small
establishments would no longer be
required to operate PQC programs for
certain processes (such as PQC
programs for processing cooked beef)
and products (such as mechanically
separated, or ‘‘deboned,’’ product).
Small and large establishments would
theoretically save about $520 per PQC
program in development costs for 320
mandatory PQC programs, or $161,720
total. Out of this total, small
establishments would save about
$151,320. Small establishments could
thus be expected to save about $4,000
each in annual recurring costs
associated with developing mandatory
PQC programs.
Regulatory Flexibility Act
The Administrator of FSIS has
determined that this proposed rule will
not have a significant effect on a
Marketplace sampling and testing can
also help in addressing food safety
hazards arising in post-processing
distribution of meat and poultry
products.
This proposal would affect, overall, as
many as 72 poultry slaughtering
establishments and about 3,550
establishments that process meat and
poultry products beyond slaughtering,
dressing, and cut-up. The most far-
reaching effect of the rule would be to
increase the flexibility establishments
have in controlling their processes. This
benefit would arise from eliminating the
required PQC program elements in
§§ 318.4(d) and 381.145(d).
With or without this proposal,
establishment HACCP plans will
supersede or incorporate the few PQC
programs that control food-safety
factors. Under the proposal, most
establishments that have PQC programs
that control for non-food safety factors
would continue to use the programs. In
all likelihood, in developing new PQC
programs, they would continue to
include the information now required
by FSIS. They would also be free to
adopt other methods of process control
and different techniques of observation,
measurement, documentation,
recordkeeping, and evaluation than are
prescribed in the current regulations.
They could change their PQC-controlled
operations to integrate their food quality
process control more effectively with
their HACCP system operations to
improve overall efficiency. For example,
raw material control, now a required
element in PQC programs, could be
handled under an establishment?s
HACCP plan, as could process controls
for food safety. Similarly, the records
requirements for PQC programs could
be superseded by more efficient and
appropriate establishment-developed
systems. Establishments would thus be
able to achieve unquantifiable gains in
efficiency that would yield food-safety
and other consumer-protection benefits.
FSIS-inspected establishments
develop about 1,900 PQC programs a
year according to regulatory design
specifications. Assuming that a PQC
program is developed by a QC manager
earning about $26 an hour, and that it
takes about 20 hours, on average, to
develop a PQC program, the cost to an
establishment of developing such a
program is about $520. FSIS estimates
that the cost to the regulated industry of
developing such programs is about
$1,000,000 per year.
This cost of developing PQC programs
according to FSIS requirements, plus
$13 million in annual operating costs
for about 1,852 mandatory (required by
regulation) PQC programs ($26/hr. X

Type of Collection: Revision.
Abstract: FSIS has reviewed the
paperwork and recordkeeping
requirements in this proposed rule in
accordance with the Paperwork
Reduction Act. This proposed rule
would substantially reduce reporting
requirements for official establishments.
The proposed rule would remove the
design requirements affecting most PQC
programs that establishments have and
most requirements for establishments to
have PQC programs for certain products
or processes. Currently, there are
624,465 burden hours associated with
the PQC program requirements. FSIS
will request OMB to eliminate all these
burden hours from the information
collection request 0083–0089.
List of Subjects
§ 318.4
[Amended]
4. Paragraph (d) of § 318.4 would be
removed.
5. Section 318.7 would be amended to
read as follows:
a. Paragraphs (b)(3)(i) and (b)(3)(ii)
would be revised;
b. The table in paragraph (c)(4), under
the Class of substance ‘‘Miscellaneous,’’
the entry for the Substance ‘‘Ascorbic
acid, erythorbic acid, citric acid, sodium
acetate, and sodium citrate, singly or in
combination’’ would be revised.
The revisions would read as follows:
9 CFR Part 317
Meat inspection, Reporting and
recordkeeping requirements.
9 CFR Part 318
Meat inspection, Reporting and
recordkeeping requirements.
9 CFR Part 319
Food labeling, Meat inspection.
9 CFR Part 381
Poultry and poultry products,
Reporting and recordkeeping
requirements.
For the reasons set forth in the
preamble, FSIS is proposing to amend 9
CFR Chapter III, the Federal meat and
poultry inspection regulations, as
follows:
PART 317—LABELING, MARKING
DEVICES, AND CONTAINERS
1. The authority citation for part 317
would continue to read as follows:
Authority: 21 U.S.C. 601–695; 7 CFR 2.18,
2.53.
Operating costs of PQC programs vary
widely. A simple PQC program to verify
the accuracy of scales, for example, may
require that tests be performed only
several times a year, at little cost in
operator time. A PQC program for a
complex process, on the other hand,
may require daily tests and data
collection and recordkeeping tasks
lasting up to 4 hours. For the purposes
of this document, PQC programs are
each assumed to require up to 1 hour’s
worth of daily attention by the
establishment QC specialist. The
removal of the PQC requirements
would, at least theoretically, relieve
small establishments of these burdens.
Assuming, for example, that small
establishments incur annual costs of
about $12,000,000 in operating
mandatory PQC programs (solely in
operating the QC evaluation process of
such programs, and not including
laboratory analysis, and other special
facilities that may be required to
determine whether products are in
compliance with the regulations), each
establishment could theoretically save
about $4,000 in PQC program
operations.
In addition, small establishments
would benefit through unquantifiable
savings accruing from removal of
regulatory design requirements for both
mandatory and voluntary PQC
programs. They would have additional
flexibility, beyond the removal of prior
approval requirements effected by FSIS
Docket No. 95–032F, to develop and
implement HACCP-consistent or other
process control systems.
Thus, about $8,000 in recurring
savings could theoretically accrue to
each small meat and poultry
establishment. However, because many,
if not most, affected establishments
would be likely to continue to operate
PQC programs that help in producing
products with consistent and uniform
characteristics, establishments may not
choose to reap the theoretical savings
that could result from eliminating their
PQC programs. The effect of the
proposed rule on the substantial number

SUMMARY: The FAA proposes to issue
special conditions for the McDonnell
Douglas Corporation Model MD–17
airplane. This airplane will have novel
and unusual design features, including
the use of power-augmented-lift from
externally blown flaps, for which the
applicable airworthiness standards for
transport category airplanes do not
contain adequate or appropriate safety
standards. This document contains the
additional safety standards that the
Administrator considers necessary to
establish a level of safety equivalent to
that provided by the existing
airworthiness standards.
DATES: Comments must be received on
or before July 2, 1999.
On July 7, 1996, McDonnell Douglas
Corporation, 2401 E. Wardlow Rd., Long
Beach, CA 90807–5309, a wholly owned
subsidiary of The Boeing Company,
submitted an application for type
certification of a commercial version of
the Model C–17 military airplane,
designated as the MDC Model MD–17.
The MD–17 is a long range, transport
category airplane powered by four Pratt
& Whitney F–117–PW–100 engines,
which are a military version of the
PW2040 engines used on other civil
transport category airplane types. The
airplane will be offered in a cargo
configuration only and is designed for
carriage of outsized cargo into short
runways.
The MD–17 airplane will be certified
as a part 25 transport category airplane
and, as such, pilots and flight
instructors who operate it will have a
standard airplane multiengine rating.
