BACHUS FLOOR STATEMENT ON THE HOUSE ECONOMIC STIMULUS PACKAGE
  
Mr. Speaker: Today I rise in support of this bipartisan economic stimulus
package.
  
 
  
The Financial Services Committee was responsible for
the housing provisions of the stimulus package and it
is those sections toward which I will direct most of my
comments.  Before doing so, I want to add a few
words of support for the tax cuts in this legislation. 
  
 
  
The stimulus package we are considering
today recognizes the basic economic
reality that getting money back in the
hands of the people who earned it is the
 1 / 24
BACHUS FLOOR STATEMENT ON THE HOUSE ECONOMIC STIMULUS PACKAGE
best way to help our economy.
  
 
  
The tax element of this package
has been called a rebate but, in
essence, it’s a tax cut for millions
of low and moderate income
Americans.  This will mean
immediate tax relief for
hard-working taxpayers, and the
improvement to our economy that
always results from allowing
 2 / 24
BACHUS FLOOR STATEMENT ON THE HOUSE ECONOMIC STIMULUS PACKAGE
taxpayers to decide how their
own hard earned money is spent. 
Hopefully, this will stimulate not
only the economy, but also it will
serve to prompt my colleagues to
enact additional tax cuts in the
future and make the Bush tax cuts
that have worked so well,
permanent.

It is widely recognized that
the troubled housing market
is a significant contributor to
the current slowdown in our
economy. 
  
 
  
This stimulus package

BACHUS FLOOR STATEMENT ON THE HOUSE ECONOMIC STIMULUS PACKAGE
includes several
provisions designed to
address the lack of
liquidity in certain
segments of the
mortgage market.  The
bill increases – but only
on a temporary basis –
the loan limits that apply
to mortgages that can be
purchased by the
housing GSEs (Fannie

Mae and Freddie Mac)
and insured by the
Federal Housing
Administration (FHA).

Greater availability of
higher-cost mortgages
and FHA-insured
loans should help get
prospective
homebuyers off the
sidelines in those
housing markets
where price declines
have been especially

severe, while also
assisting existing
homeowners seeking
to refinance into more
affordable mortgage
products.  The
combined effect of
these changes is
intended to help
restore confidence in

BACHUS FLOOR STATEMENT ON THE HOUSE ECONOMIC STIMULUS PACKAGE
our economy. 
  
 
  
The higher GSE
and FHA loan limits
 9 / 24
BACHUS FLOOR STATEMENT ON THE HOUSE ECONOMIC STIMULUS PACKAGE
– like the other
provisions in this
stimulus package –
are both targeted
and temporary. 
They will expire at
the end of this year,
thereby addressing
the concerns of
 10 / 24
BACHUS FLOOR STATEMENT ON THE HOUSE ECONOMIC STIMULUS PACKAGE
those who fear that
expanding eligibility
for GSE and FHA
loan products will
unduly increase
Federal housing
subsidies.  While I
would have
preferred that these

increases be
implemented as
part of
comprehensive
GSE and FHA
reform, I am
encouraged by the
commitments that
Chairman Frank
 12 / 24

and the Chairman
of the Senate
Banking Committee
have made to us
that achievement of
those broader
reforms will be
among their highest
priorities during this
 13 / 24
BACHUS FLOOR STATEMENT ON THE HOUSE ECONOMIC STIMULUS PACKAGE
congressional
session.  As the
GSEs purchase
larger mortgages
and take on more
risk, it is incumbent
upon this Congress
to produce
legislation that

creates a
world-class
regulator for these
enterprises and
fully protects U.S.
taxpayers.  The
House passed a bill
last May, and it is
now the Senate’s

BACHUS FLOOR STATEMENT ON THE HOUSE ECONOMIC STIMULUS PACKAGE
turn to act.
  
 
  
            The
 16 / 24
BACHUS FLOOR STATEMENT ON THE HOUSE ECONOMIC STIMULUS PACKAGE
bottom line is that
we must not only
take these
measures that
offer real
solutions, but also
do what can be
done to increase
 17 / 24
BACHUS FLOOR STATEMENT ON THE HOUSE ECONOMIC STIMULUS PACKAGE
and encourage
optimism among
all Americans. 
There is
legitimate reason
for doing so -- we
should do that as
urgently as

possible.

Mr. Speaker, let
me conclude by
commending
President Bush,
Chairman Frank
and the
Republican and
Democratic

leadership of
the House for
coming together
so quickly
around this
