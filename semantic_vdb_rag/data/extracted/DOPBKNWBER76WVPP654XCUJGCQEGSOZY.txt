Introduction 
 
Money Smart for Small Business (MSSB) is an instructor-led curriculum developed jointly by the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA). The 13 modules in 
this curriculum provide introductory business training for aspiring and existing entrepreneurs on the basics of 
starting and growing a business. In addition, the curriculum serves as a foundation for more advanced training 
and technical assistance.  
 
The MSSB Curriculum was created to assist financial institutions and community organizations (Small Business 
or Economic Development Organizations, Community Banks, Financial Institutions, Government Programs, 
Chambers of Commerce, Business Chambers/Trade Associations and Independent Small Business Consultants) 
deliver introductory business training. The FDIC and SBA invite financial institutions and community 
organizations to order and begin teaching this free curriculum. 
 
The MSSB Curriculum is a tool for partnerships. For example, financial institution staff can deliver a MSSB 
Program in collaboration with small business resource providers.  
 
The topics in the MSSB Curriculum were selected through focus groups and interviews with small business 
technical assistance practitioners.  
 
About This Participant Guide 
 
This Train-the-Trainer Participant Guide is designed to help financial institutions and community organizations 
conduct effective Money Smart for Small Business introductory business training for aspiring and existing 
entrepreneurs in their communities.  
 
This guide includes complementing information to the Train-the-Trainer PowerPoint presentation, a matrix 
summarizing the 13 MSSB modules, a Participant Guide, Instructor Guide and PowerPoint presentation for the 
“Managing Cash Flow” module to showcase how the three components of all 13 MSSB modules interact; and a 
comprehensive Success Tips section. A glossary of terms is also provided to explain the use of specific terms 
within the context of the MSSB TtT Curriculum. Words in italic can be found in the MSSB TtT Curriculum 
Glossary of Terms.

MSSB: What It Is  
 
MSSB is an instructor-led business curriculum or tool collaboratively developed by the FDIC and SBA that 
provides introductory business training for aspiring and existing entrepreneurs on the basics of starting and 
growing a business.

In 2015, three new modules were created and all 13 modules were translated into Spanish and made available 
for download. 
Each module takes between 60-90 minutes to present and includes three components: an Instructor Guide, a 
Participant Guide and PowerPoint. 
The modules are instructor led; can be edited or customized; delivered as stand-alone modules; mixed and 
matched to meet the specific needs of entrepreneurs; and integrated into the training programs that financial 
institutions and community organizations currently utilize to create a lasting impact in their communities.

participants in the basics, the curriculum serves as a foundation for more advanced training and technical 
assistance.

• 
Recognize the role of a personal credit score in the lending process

Credit Reporting 
 
The “Credit Reporting” module highlights the impact of credit reports on the operation and growth of a business 
and the impact that the business owner’s personal credit can have on it. 
It identifies credit reports and other systems used to assess the risk of extending credit to entrepreneurs and 
small business owners. 
At the end of the module, entrepreneurs will:

of a small business

It may be best for companies in all stages of business development, especially for those who may have concerns

There’s plenty of content provided by various organizations about personal credit scores, but this module may 
be one of a few resources related to business credit.  
Some financial institutions and community organizations use this module as a stand-alone module or as a 
complement to other business development initiatives. Others have used it as part of a one-day session where 
the “Credit” and “Banking” modules were taught in partnership with financial institutions and credit counseling 
organizations.

At the end of the module, entrepreneurs will:

Statistics show that the majority of small businesses operate as sole proprietorships. Business owners need to 
understand how to protect themselves and their business assets.

and Threats) analysis and it may work well if combined with the Insurance Module. 
 
Selling a Business and Succession Planning 
 
The “Selling a Business and Succession Planning” module explains how to establish an exit strategy for a

Understand the importance of time management 
• 
Discover commonly used time management practices like  
o Pareto analysis 
o ABC method 
o Eisenhower method

It may be best for companies in all stages of business development as the nature of small businesses is that they 
are typically short staffed. As such, time management is critical to their success. 
The Time Management module may work well if combined with the Organization Types module as it fosters 
thinking about how to fulfill the needs of the business, who is involved and what other human resources are 
needed. 
 
Is Small Business Ownership a Good Fit For You? 
 
The “Is Small Business Ownership a Good Fit For You?” module is one of three new modules and helps the 
aspiring entrepreneur think about the realities of starting a business and their readiness to start a business.  
At the end of the module, entrepreneurs will: 
• 
Discern between the myths and realities of small business ownership 
• 
Start a self-assessment to determine their readiness to become a small business owner 
• 
Gain insight about their readiness to start a business 
It may be best for aspiring entrepreneurs at the early stages of their decision-making, but existing business 
owners can also benefit from the self-assessments in the Participant Guide. 
It’s also recommended that this module be offered first in a program as it helps set the stage for later modules or 
classes. 
 
Planning for a Healthy Business 
 
The “Planning for a Healthy Business” module is the second of the three new modules and introduces aspiring 
entrepreneurs to the benefits of planning and making smart decisions.  
It’s recommended that this module be part of the second class in a program as it covers four different forms of 
planning, from simple to complex. 
At the end of the module, entrepreneurs will: 
• 
Discover a 4-Step Business Planning process, via a case study, that will help them create a long-term 
healthy business 
o Back-of-Napkin Plan 
o Resource Plan 
o Business Plan 
 
Page 11 of 92  
MSSB Train-the-Trainer Workshop, Participant Guide 
 
 
o Action Plan 
It may be best for aspiring entrepreneurs who are thinking about starting a business. The planning process will 
elevate their decision-making. Existing business owners can also benefit from some of the planning tools 
provided in their Participant Guide. 
Entrepreneurs attending this class will be introduced to business planning, but should seek alternative business 
planning resources to develop a business plan on their own or with the assistance from the organization hosting 
the training and/or its partners.  
 
Managing Cash Flow 
 
The “Managing Cash Flow” module is a great overview of cash flow and how to manage cash flow. This is the 
third new module and should be scheduled after the Financial Management module.  
At the end of the module, entrepreneurs will: 
• 
Learn about the critical importance of cash flow management in a small business  
• 
Act as advisors to Bob and the Wired Cup  
• 
Understand the need for expert assistance and advice 
It may be best for companies in all stages of business development, especially those who lack financial 
management expertise. This module is especially helpful for new business owners who need to prepare to work 
with accountants, as it demystifies a lot of cash flow terminology. 
 
The Deep Dive 
 
The “Managing Cash Flow” module is a highly interactive learning experience that encourages participants to 
focus on cash flow management as an essential competency of business ownership. No matter where learners 
are in the development of their businesses, this 90-minute module encourages them to ask questions about their 
business and prepare to interact with accountants to analyze the flow of cash in and out of their business. 
 
On page 27 in the appendix, you will find the Participant Guide for the Managing Cash Flow Module.  
 
Evaluation Best Practices 
 
At the end of every module or class, each module should be evaluated for two main reasons: 
 
1. To evaluate the quality and impact of the module 
2. To help identify what is next  
 
Evaluate for Quality and Impact 
 
The Participant Guide for each module includes an evaluation form on the last page. The forms are easy to 
complete. Evaluation forms are effective tools for gauging immediate reactions to a class. Another great way to 
evaluate impact is to conduct an anonymous follow-up survey about a week after the class. Consider using a 
free online tool to create a survey for the participants.  
 
Page 12 of 92  
MSSB Train-the-Trainer Workshop, Participant Guide 
 
 
Ask questions such as:  
• 
Now that you have had time to reflect, what do you feel were the most compelling learning points of the 
Managing Cash Flow module? 
• 
What steps have you taken to apply the Managing Cash Flow module key principles to your own small 
business? 
• 
If you have not applied the principles of Managing Cash Flow to your small business, what prevented 
you? 
 
Evaluate what is next 
 
Here are some ways to identify which modules your participants will most want/need: 
 
• 
At the end of a class, conduct a debriefing conversation. Ask, “What should happen next?” 
• 
Scan the Parking Lot for questions that indicate a need for additional classes.  
• 
Interview guest experts for their ideas. They can offer great advice based on the questions the 
participants asked them.  
 
 
Getting Started With MSSB 
 
Selecting Modules 
 
When selecting which modules to deliver and in what sequence, please consider the following information: 
 
• 
The modules can stand-alone and be presented topic by topic 
• 
The modules can be mixed and matched to meet the entrepreneur’s needs 
• 
The modules can be integrated into an existing training program 
• 
The modules are free of copyrights, which means financial institution and community logos can be 
added to the materials 
• 
The modules are available in Word and PDF formats and thus customizable 
 
Selection Options  
 
Ideally any program will start with the two fundamental modules: Is Small Business Ownership a Good Fit for 
You? and Planning for a Healthy Business. These modules cover fundamental principles of small business 
ownership. They are very interactive, which helps host organizations learn more about the entrepreneurs 
businesses and concerns. Some financial institutions and community organizations offer individual classes once 
or twice a week for a number of weeks, as shown on the following page. A benefit of this approach is that host 
organizations can plan and advertise an entire program ahead of time. It’s easy to recruit and orient experts as 
well. The downside to this approach is that host organizations are locked into a plan that may not fit the needs 
of their entrepreneurs.

Time Management and Graduation 
 
Other financial institutions and community organizations may prefer to offer combinations, such as full-day 
programs on Saturdays once or twice per month allowing them to combine two or more modules. As depicted 
below, the modules have been selected for Day 1 and the modules for Days 2, 3 and 4 are not set. This allows 
the host organization to custom design a program based on focus group feedback and from questions the 
entrepreneurs and small business owners ask. This option may be challenging to manage in terms of advertising 
and for recruiting any experts that might be needed. 
The entrepreneurs in attendance will be invaluable advisors on the selection and sequencing of modules. Ask 
them what they want to know and ideal times to offer classes. Be flexible. While it’s a great idea to have a 
sequence of modules in mind, be prepared to adapt plans based on each entrepreneur’s questions and feedback.

Working with Experts 
 
Many MSSB Alliance members use guest experts to augment the experience and expertise of the host 
organization instructor. Guest experts bring a wealth of experience and expertise to Money Smart classes.  
 
There are three main categories of experts: 
 
1. Small business owners who have great stories to share (both success stories and cautionary tales) 
2. Representatives from such fields as banking, credit reporting and taxation 
3. Professionals who advise clients on a regular basis, such as accountants or insurance brokers  
 
Guest experts contribute a great deal to Money Smart classes. They tell interesting stories and share real-life 
experiences about what to do, or not to do. There are some risks associated with working with experts, as well. 
If they are unprepared they can be ineffective. They can lose track of time or provide examples that are not 
relevant to the questions the learners ask. Some experts tend to use jargon or technical language which might 
confuse participants more than help them. When working with experts, provide them with clear directions and 
parameters to ensure success. 
 
Join the Money Smart Alliance 
 
Anyone can download the Money Smart for Small Business curriculum which is available at the FDIC Catalog. 
However, we encourage organizations to join the Money Smart Alliance to benefit from meeting other MSSB 
users. 
 
There is a short form to fill out and the most updated link will always be available at the MSSB Webpage. 
Both joining the alliance and downloading the curriculums are very easy. The materials available for download 
are: Instructor Guide, Participant Guide and PowerPoint presentation for each of the modules. A CD-ROM 
including all modules can also be ordered by using the FDIC Catalog ordering system. 
 
Eligibility 
 
No certifications are required to use the curriculum; however, it’s ideal that MSSB instructors have experience 
in the delivery of training, technical assistance or coaching for small businesses. The website (under the heading 
“Money Smart for Small Business Alliance”) includes a self-assessment questionnaire that should help 
organizations determine whether they are ready to adopt MSSB. The most current questionnaire is below: 
 
Is Your Organization Ready to Offer Training? A Self-Assessment 
 
The following questions can help you gauge your organization's readiness to offer Money Smart for Small 
Business as a member of the Money Smart Alliance. These questions can also help you think about the steps 
you’ll need to take to set up a training program in your community. 
 
• 
Does your organization have experience providing training to small businesses (including technical 
assistance, mentoring, coaching, etc.)? 
• 
Does your organization work with small businesses to help them raise debt or equity? 
• 
Does your organization provide finance directly or in partnership with others?

• 
Are your organization’s marketing efforts able to reach into the small business community? 
• 
Are you able to reach unbanked/underbanked populations? 
• 
Do you have partners to help you in these efforts? 
• 
Do you have your target market for the training in mind? 
• 
Does your organization have subject matter experts in-house? If not, do you have access to experts to 
deliver the course? 
• 
Is your organization or your partners able to provide follow-up support after the completion of the class? 
 
If you’ve answered “Yes” to the majority of these questions, then you’re in good shape to deliver quality 
trainings!

The banking module along with the credit 
module may be two of the most useful 
modules for financial institutions and 
community organizations that may already 
have business training resources. While there 
are multiple personal banking training 
resources in the marketplace, the MSSB 
Banking module is not designed to promote 
any financial institution. This module 
objectively explains the different types of 
banking services available to businesses; and 
it may be complemented by other Money 
Smart products for individuals. Please check 
the FDIC Catalog (https://catalog.fdic.gov/) 
for other products that may complement an 
MSSB Program. Further, bankers are 
traditionally great candidates to lend their 
subject matter expertise to teach or facilitate 
this module in collaboration with 
organizations serving aspiring and existing 
entrepreneurs. 
• Explain the concept of credit reporting 
and the impact of credit reports on the 
operation or growth of a small business.

development, especially for those who may 
have concerns about their credit scores 
and/or those who plan to apply for loans.  
 
While there are multiple personal credit 
training programs and resources provided by 
credit counseling organizations, there are few 
resources explaining business credit and its

Money Smart products for individuals. P

products that may complement an MSSB 
Program.

module may be effectively offered in 
combination with the “Risk Management” 
module and “Organizational Types” for

Introducing Bob and the Wired Cup 
The Wired 
Cup 
Bob recently opened a new bakery café, The Wired Cup. The café has 
a great location in a small college town. To get started, Bob invested 
$30,000 of his own money and received a $20,000 loan from a 
commercial bank. He spent $45,000 on start-up costs, leaving $5,000 
to run his business.  
 
The Wired Cup is already popular with students, university staff, and 
neighbors. Everyone loves the coffee and baked goods. A college 
dean has started to order croissants for the faculty dining hall. Bob is 
building a great new business.  
 
However, Bob has concerns. He has not yet paid himself, and he 
wonders when he can. The $5,000 is almost gone. Given that his key 
customers are students, he assumes many of them will go home over 
holiday breaks and the summer. Questions Bob is now asking: 
 
• How will he pay his bills if there are fewer customers?  
• Will he have enough money to ramp up again in September?  
• Should he buy in bulk to reduce costs?  
• Will suppliers allow Bob to buy on credit, or does he still have to pay cash? 
 
The good news is that Bob is thinking ahead. He has time to work to find some solutions. As we review The 
Wired Cup’s cash flow issues, you will be able to apply these concepts to your own business.

Cash Conversion Cycle  
 
 
 
A cash conversion cycle depicts how business dollars are invested in raw materials, resources, and 
other inputs. Those raw materials can be converted into products that are sold to generate payments 
or cash.  
 
If you have a short conversion cycle, you can quickly sell inventory or turn it back into cash which 
puts money back into the cash flow system in a relatively short period of time. 
 
If you have a long cash conversion cycle, you will not be able to use that money while your inventory is 
unsold, sitting on your shelves. Money will not be flowing back into the system.

Cash Flow Diagram Descriptions 
The cash flow diagram on the previous page contains several key cash flow elements. It is a 
representation of how cash moves in and out of the system, and many of the key decision points or 
valves a business owner can control.  
When you start a business, money flows into the business via debt or equity.  
The valves in the diagram represent decision points. Your decisions impact cash flow and 
increase or decrease your probability of success. Some valves are open all the time (like taxes and 
debt). They are a constant drain on your cash which is why they are on the bottom. Some valves are 
partially open, like the sales, general, and administrative valves. You always spend money here; how 
much is up to you. As you spend available cash, balance in the center tank drops.  
Inventory. You spend money on raw materials, labor, and other direct costs to produce a product to 
sell (assuming you are producing a product, but the same principles apply for services as well). If you 
decide to spend a lot on inventory, you are deciding to tie up your money until you sell the inventory 
and turn it into cash. This is called the cash conversion cycle.  
Fixed assets are usually expensive items that last, such as buildings, upgrades to space, vehicles, 
equipment, computers, and technology. If you purchase an expensive fixed asset, it ties up available 
cash. A better option is to lease to keep cash flowing.  
Profit generator (sales pump). In the top left corner is a sales pump. Keep this primed to pump 
sales back into the system.  
Accounts receivable (A/R). You may make a sale, but not the cash until you collect it. Ultimately 
you want to convert your accounts receivable into cash, so it flows into the center tank and becomes 
available cash  
Accounts payable (A/P). In the center tank, accounts payable are represented by bricks. This is 
money owed to vendors and suppliers who extend credit to you. For example, you receive a product or 
service but you have not yet paid for it. You still have use of that money. The bricks elevate the water. 
Instead of having to pay for a product or service, you can use that money for marketing or paying 
another bill. 
Balancing accounts payable and accounts receivable is challenging.  You want customers to pay you as 
quickly as possible (cash in) and you want to pay as slowly as possible (cash out). Your vendors are 
doing the same thing. They want you to pay quickly, and they may be slow to pay their own vendors.  
Ultimately, you want to have and be generating excess cash flow from profitable operations 
(ECFPO). This is the showerhead, which represents your paycheck.

Cash Flow Statements  
A cash flow statement tells a story:  
 
1. How much money you have to run your business. 
2. How much cash is moving in and out of the business. 
3. Where that cash is coming from and going to.  
4. When the cash is moving or needs to move.  
 
As a business owner, you need to think ahead in order to meet your financial obligations and run a 
profitable business. A cash flow statement helps identify when your business is generating more cash 
than you need to meet obligations. Conversely, it tells you when the business is running short. Cash 
flow statements help you make smart, timely decisions that ensure your business is financially healthy 
over the long term.

What Can Bob Do? 
To stay in business, Bob needs to increase his sales revenue. He also needs to 
negotiate agreements that decrease costs and help to control cash flow. To do 
this, he needs to juggle some competing demands. He wants to hold on to his 
cash as long as possible. His landlord and vendors want to be paid right away. 
To balance these expectations, Bob needs to make agreements that benefit all 
involved parties. These “win–win” negotiations benefit all parties. Bob has lots 
of opportunities to negotiate win–win agreements. 
 
If you were advising him, what would you suggest? 
 
 
• How can Bob increase sales revenue at The Wired Cup? 
 
• How could Bob negotiate a better deal or two with his vendors and suppliers? 
 
• How can Bob plan for the seasonal ups and downs in his business? 
 
• Is it wise for Bob to use a credit card to offset cash flow issues? 
 
Notes 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
What NOT To Do 
 
 
• 
Do not postpone paying estimated taxes. 
• 
Do not hide from loan officers – they can provide invaluable advice. 
• 
Do not pay vendors later (they can cut off supply). 
• 
Do not overestimate revenue. 
• 
Do not underestimate costs.

Negotiating Better Terms 
To manage cash flow, you want your customers to pay you right away so 
you can use that cash to meet your financial obligations. On the other 
hand, you want to pay your vendors as late as possible, usually 30 days. 
The trick is to manage your accounts receivable (the money others owe 
you) and your accounts payable (the money you owe). 
Customers 
• If a customer pays cash, this is great. If a customer pays with a credit or debit card, this is good, but the 
profitability is lower because the business has to pay a credit card processing service and fees charged by the 
credit card issuer. These fees are usually not negotiable. Ask customers to pay in cash to avoid fees. Some 
small companies no longer take credit or debit cards; the risk is that some customers might not buy if they do 
not have cash on them.  
• Sell gift cards. The buyer of a gift card pays you the full amount of the gift card up front.  
• Corporate accounts are a great way to increase sales. The challenge is that these customers do not always pay 
right away. Most invoices are supposed to be paid in 30 days. That creates lag time between when the product 
or service is provided, and when a business is paid. Most invoices are “net 30 days,” which means the client 
pays within 30 days of the date the product or service is delivered. To improve cash flow and to get paid 
early, a business owner can ask a corporate account to pay when the invoice is received, or maybe in 10 or 15 
days. Offer them incentives to pay early. Most businesses offer a “2/10, net 30” discount meaning the 
customer will receive a 2% invoice discount if they pay in 10 days instead of 30. 
Vendors and Suppliers 
• Most new businesses are required by their vendors to pay cash for supplies, inventory, and the like. After you 
develop a good reputation for paying on time (maybe a year), ask vendors to invoice you instead of asking for 
cash. This allows a business to pay in 30 days, which preserves cash flow.  
Landlords 
A major fixed monthly expense for many business owners is a lease or rent payment. Before you agree 
to a lease and the subsequent fixed monthly cost, you may be able to negotiate better terms and 
payment options to free up your cash flow. Carefully review the lease conditions and negotiate any 
added expenses or fees associated with the lease, such as upkeep, maintenance, common areas, 
utilities, snow removal, landscaping services, or parking lot maintenance. As part of the negotiation you 
can discuss options, such as sub-leases, exclusivity, and co-tenancy.  
 
Think about what happens if you default. What would happen to your business? You may be able to 
negotiate those terms as well. A lawyer could provide you advice. 
 
If you know that your business is seasonal, negotiate a payment plan. Let’s say your rent is $1,000 per 
month. If you anticipate your revenue to go down because of seasonal issues, ask the landlord to accept 
early or late payments. Another idea might be to make fewer payments. For instance, multiplying the 
$1,000 by 12 months equals $12,000. Divide $12,000 by nine, which comes to $1,333 per month. You 
pay the same $12,000 to the landlord but you do not have to pay during the three months when you 
expect your revenue to be down.

Toolkit of Resources– Managing Cash Flow Module 
Glossary of Cash Flow Terms 
Term 
Definition 
Accounts Payable 
Accounts payable (A/P) is money a business owner owes to vendors, service 
providers, tax agencies and so on. Liability that results from the purchase of 
goods or services (money owed to others). 
Accounts Receivable 
Accounts receivable (A/R) is money that is due from customers as a result of 
delivering goods or services and extending credit in the ordinary course of 
business. 
Accrual Basis of 
Accounting 
The accrual basis of accounting measures the performance and position of a 
company by recognizing economic events regardless of when cash 
transactions occur. The general idea is that economic events are recognized 
by matching revenues to expenses (the matching principle) at the time in 
which the transaction occurs rather than when payment is made (or 
received). This method allows the current cash inflows/outflows to be 
combined with future expected cash inflows/outflows to give a more 
accurate picture of a company's current financial condition. 
Fixed Assets 
A fixed asset is a long-term tangible piece of property that a firm owns and 
uses in the production of its income and is not expected to be consumed or 
converted into cash any sooner than at least one year's time. 
Balance Sheet 
A balance sheet is a financial statement that summarizes a company's assets, 
liabilities and shareholders' equity at a specific point in time. These three 
balance sheet segments give investors an idea as to what the company owns 
and owes, as well as the amount invested by the shareholders. 
Burn Rate 
A burn rate describes the rate at which a new company uses up its venture 
capital to finance overhead before generating positive cash flow from 
operations. In other words, it's a measure of negative cash flow. 
Capital 
Capital can mean many things. Its specific definition depends on the context 
in which it is used. In general, it refers to financial resources available for 
use such as: financial assets or the financial value of assets, such as cash. It 
is also used to describe the factories, machinery, and equipment owned by a 
business and used in production. 
Cash Conversion Cycle 
A cash conversion cycle depicts how business dollars are invested in 
materials, resources, and other inputs. Raw materials can be converted into 
products that are sold to generate payments or cash. If a business has a short 
conversion cycle, the owner can quickly turn it back into cash which puts 
money back into the business in a relatively short period of time. If a 
business has a long cash conversion cycle, the owner will not be able to use 
that money while inventory is unsold.  
Cash Flow Statement 
A cash flow statement tells a business how much money is available to run 
the business, how much cash is moving in and out of the business, where 
that cash is coming from and going to, and when the cash is moving or needs 
to move.

Term 
Definition 
 
A cash flow statement helps a business owner to think ahead. It helps 
pinpoint when a business is generating more cash than needed to meet 
obligations. Conversely, it alerts a business owner when the business is 
running short. Cash flow statements are invaluable tools that permit business 
owners to make smart, timely decisions over the long term. 
Cash on Hand 
Funds that are immediately available to a business, and can be spent as 
needed. 
Current Assets 
A balance sheet account that represents the value of all assets that are 
reasonably expected to be converted into cash within one year in the normal 
course of business. Current assets include cash, accounts receivable, 
inventory, marketable securities, prepaid expenses and other liquid assets 
that can be readily converted to cash. 
Current Liabilities 
A company's debts or obligations that are due within one year. Current 
liabilities appear on the company's balance sheet and include short term 
debt, accounts payable, accrued liabilities and other debts 
Debt Principal 
Amount borrowed or the amount still owed on a loan, separate from interest 
Depreciation 
Income tax deduction that allows a taxpayer to recover the cost or other 
basis of certain property; annual allowance for the wear and tear, 
deterioration, or obsolescence of the property. 
Equity 
Equity is a stock or any other security representing an ownership interest. 
On a company's balance sheet, equity is the amount of the funds contributed 
by the owners (the stockholders) plus the retained earnings or losses.  
Fixed Cost 
A fixed cost does not change with an increase or decrease in the amount of 
goods or services produced. Fixed costs are expenses that have to be paid by 
a company, independent of any business activity. It is one of the two 
components of the total cost of a good or service, along with variable cost. 
Gross Profit 
Gross Profit is a company's revenue minus its cost of goods sold. It is a 
company's residual profit after selling a product or service and deducting the 
cost associated with its production and sale. 
Income Statement 
A financial statement that measures a company's financial performance over 
a specific accounting period. Financial performance is assessed by giving a 
summary of how the business incurs its revenues and expenses through both 
operating and non-operating activities. It shows the net profit or loss 
incurred over a specific period, typically over a fiscal quarter or year. An 
Income Statement is also known as a profit and loss statement or statement 
of revenue and expense. 
Interest 
Interest is a fee paid for the use of another party's money. To the borrower it 
is the cost of renting money, to the lender the income from lending it. 
Invoice 
An invoice is a commercial document that itemizes a transaction between a 
buyer and a seller. It will usually include the quantity of purchase, price of 
goods and/or services, date, parties involved, unique invoice number, and 
tax information. If goods or services were purchased on credit, the invoice 
MANAGING CASH FLOW PARTICIPANT GUIDE

MSSB Train-the-Trainer Workshop, Participant Guide 
Term 
Definition 
will usually specify the terms of the deal and provide information on the 
available methods of payment. An invoice is also known as a bill, statement, 
or sales invoice.  
Liquidity 
Liquidity is the degree to which an asset or security can be bought or sold in 
the market without affecting the asset's price. Liquidity is characterized by a 
high level of trading activity. Assets that can be easily bought or sold are 
known as liquid assets. The term is also used to define the ability to convert 
an asset to cash quickly. Also known as marketability. Liquidity is often 
calculated by using liquidity ratios. 
Net Profit 
Net Profit is your bottom line. This shows how much your company is 
making on sales after expenses, interest, and taxes. 
Variable Cost 
A variable cost is a corporate expense that varies with production output. 
Variable costs fluctuate depending on a company's production volume. They 
rise as production increases and fall as production decreases. Variable costs 
differ from fixed costs such as rent, advertising, insurance and office 
supplies, which tend to remain the same regardless of production output. 
Fixed costs plus variable costs equal total cost. 
Vendor 
A vendor is a party in the supply chain that makes goods and services 
available to companies or consumers. The term is typically used to describe 
an entity that is paid for the goods that are provided, rather than the 
manufacturer of the goods. A vendor, however, can operate both as the 
supplier of goods (seller) and the manufacturer.

Getting Started 
These ideas will help you plan and present engaging and productive 
sessions: 
• Effective use of PowerPoint. Use the slides to introduce key concepts only. 
They are provided to enhance your presentation, they are not the 
presentation. Avoid reading slides to the learners. Add your perspective. 
Learners appreciate examples and brief anecdotes that make the concepts 
come alive. 
• Introductions. Introductions allow you to break the ice, create active 
instructor–participant dialogue, and set the tone for the class. They also 
provide indicators of the experience levels of your learners. 
• Diversity of learner needs. Assume that some learners are just getting started while others are 
already business owners. Address the diverse needs of learner groups. 
• Agenda. The agenda helps participants understand how the training will be conducted. 
• Expectations. Discussing expectations gives participants the opportunity to tell you what they hope 
to learn from the training. 
• Objectives. Establishing objectives helps participants place the information to be learned in the 
proper context and ensures that the content is consistent with their expectations. 
• Participant Guide format and contents. The participant guide keeps participants on track with the 
presentation. Several worksheets help them apply key concepts to their own specific contexts. 
• Pre-and Post-Tests. The Pre-Test provides a baseline measurement for evaluating the impact of 
this class. The Post-Test gauges how well participants learned the content. Both the pre- and the 
post-test are on one form at the end of the Participant Guide. 
• Discussion points. Discussion points help participants reinforce learning. 
• Parking lot flipchart/ chart paper. This option is helpful if participants ask questions that you do 
not have time to answer. Instead of answering right away, agree to answer at a later time. “Park” 
the questions on a flipchart or chart paper, and make arrangements to follow up with the 
participant(s) after the class. 
• Breaks. No formal breaks are recommended. Encourage participants to take rest room breaks if 
they need them.

Training Overview 
Icons Guide 
 Refer participants to the Participant Guide (PG) to locate information, 
descriptions, or relevant worksheets. 
 
 Engage the group in a conversation about the topic. 
 
 Assess participant comprehension or previous experience with the 
topic by asking them to complete a quick pre- and post-test. 
 
 Ask “high gain” questions to check comprehension, or present a 
problem such as “What would you do if this were your business?” 
 
 
Purpose 
This module—Managing Cash Flow—is a highly interactive learning experience that 
encourages the participants to focus on cash flow management as an essential competency of 
business ownership. No matter where learners are in the development of their businesses, this 
90-minute module encourages them to ask and answer great questions about their business 
and to get ready to interact with accountants to analyze the flow of cash in and out of their 
businesses. 
This Instructor Guide is the key document for this class. Please read it thoroughly. 
We provide plenty of white space for you to add notes and examples from your own 
experience. Please also review the related PowerPoint slides and Participant Guide in detail. 
These documents contain information or visuals you will reference during the class. 
Preparing for Class 
Each participant will require a Participant Guide (ideally printed two-sided). Participants do 
not need copies of the slides. Before printing the participant guides, consider adding local 
information to the For More Information section. In the space provided, list local resources 
that offer technical assistance or financing options to small businesses. 
Objectives  
After completing this training, the participants will be able to: 
• Describe the purpose of cash flow management in a start-up small business. 
• Assess a cash flow cycle and make some cash flow projections.  
MANAGING CASH FLOW INSTRUCTOR GUIDE 
Page 50 of 92 
MSSB Train-the-Trainer Workshop, Participant Guide 
 
 
 
• Describe how a cash flow statement can help assess and improve the financial health of a 
start-up. 
• Identify some ways to manage cash flow in terms of managing costs and potential income. 
• Identify ways to seek out expert technical assistance to improve cash flow management. 
Presentation Time 
To ensure high engagement levels with your learners, allow at least 90 minutes to deliver this 
class. Use the suggested times to personalize the class based on the needs of your participants 
and the given time. Allow extra time for discussion and questions when teaching larger 
groups. 
Materials and Equipment  
You will need the following materials and equipment to present this class: 
• Instructor Guide (for your use only). 
• Participant Guide – ideally printed two-sided – for each participant. As noted above, you may add 
local resources to the For More Information section of the Participant Guide. 
• PowerPoint slides (for your use only). 
• Audiovisual equipment such as a computer, Microsoft Office PowerPoint, overhead projector, and 
microphone, if appropriate. 
• Optional: flipchart easel, chart paper, markers. 
Discussion Points 
• Managing cash flow is a core competency of small business ownership. 
• A balance sheet tells a compelling story.  
• A cash flow statement continues that story. Use it to monitor projected and actual income 
and expenses. 
• Plan for seasonal fluctuations. 
• Try to maintain a rapid cash conversion cycle. 
• Manage your paperwork like a pro.  
• Ask an accountant for advice.  
Note 
The participants should ideally attend this class after they complete the Financial 
Management module in the Money Smart series. Financial Management introduces 
fundamental cash flow concepts and terms.

Objectives 
Welcome to Managing Cash Flow. Taking this class is an 
important step to building a better financial future for you and 
your family.  
As a small business owner, it is important to know how much 
cash is moving in and out of your business. You need to think 
ahead in order to meet financial obligations and run a profitable 
business on a long-term basis. This class introduces some basic 
cash flow concepts that can get you started. 
My name is ___________. (Briefly introduce yourself.) 
 
 
Slide 2 
Pre-Test 
Before we begin, please assess what you already know about this 
topic. Turn to the Pre- and Post-Test Form in the back of your

Agenda 
Here is the agenda for today’s class. We will discuss concepts, 
start some self-assessments, complete some interactive activities, 
and respond to your questions. 
Time Management 
Please help us stay on schedule. We do not include a formal 
break. If you need to visit the rest room, please feel free to do so. 
Optional: Explain Parking Lot Chart Paper 
 
If you have questions about your own business that we do not 
have time to answer, I will “park” your questions on chart paper. 
We can make arrangements after this class to help you find some 
answers. 
Ground Rules 
 
 
 
 
 
 
One of the best ways to learn is from each other. You probably 
have some great ideas to offer. You may know of a process that 
works well for you or some pitfall to avoid. Please speak up. Also, 
if something is not clear, please ask questions! 
Participant Materials 
 
Each of you should have a copy of the Managing Cash Flow 
Participant Guide. It contains: 
• 
Information and discussion points about this topic. 
• 
Worksheets for you to start in class and finish up on your 
own 
• 
A Toolkit of Resources to help continue your self-
education  (including a list of agencies that provide 
technical assistance to small businesses) 
Please note that we will not have time to review the entire 
Participant Guide in class. We suggest that you review it in detail 
on your own time.

Learning Objectives 
Facilitation Note:  
 Do not read the objectives to the learners. Instead, 
whenever possible, briefly paraphrase the objectives.  
 Point out that you will use the Bob’s Wired Cup case to 
introduce concepts.  
 
 Emphasize that what is most important is how these 
concepts apply to the unique situations of the learners.

Slide 6 
Introducing Bob and The Wired Cup  
We will use a realistic example to review a new business owner’s 
cash flow management decisions. As we review Bob’s cash flow 
issues, you may find that these concepts relate to your own cash 
flow questions. 
Facilitation Note: 
 The case is theoretical. If participants ask questions about 
the numbers on Bob’s statements, remind them the case 
is intended to introduce fundamental cash flow concepts. 
 
 Ask one of the participants to read Bob’s story out loud 
from page 4 in the Participant Guide. 
 
 
 
 
 
From Participant Guide: 
 
 
Introducing Bob and The Wired Cup 
Bob recently opened a new bakery café, The Wired Cup. The café 
has a great location in a small college town. To get started, Bob 
invested $30,000 of his own money and received a $20,000 loan 
from a commercial bank. He spent $45,000 on start-up costs, 
leaving $5,000 to run the business. 
The Wired Cup is already popular with students, university staff, 
MANAGING CASH FLOW INSTRUCTOR GUIDE

Instructor Notes 
Presentation Guidelines 
and neighbors. Everyone loves the coffee and baked goods. A 
college dean has started to order croissants for the faculty dining 
hall. Bob is building a great new business.  
However, Bob has concerns. He has not yet paid himself, and he 
wonders when he can. The $5,000 is almost gone. Given that his 
key customers are students, he assumes many will go home over 
holiday breaks and the summer. Questions Bob is now asking:  
• 
How will he pay his bills if there are fewer customers?  
• 
Will he have enough money to ramp up again in September?  
• 
Should he buy in bulk to reduce costs?  
• 
Will suppliers allow Bob to buy on credit, or does he still have 
to pay cash? 
The good news is that Bob is thinking ahead. He has time to find 
some solutions. As we review the Wired Cup’s cash flow issues, 
you will be able to apply these concepts to your own business. 
Facilitation Note: 
 
 
 Thank the volunteer for the assistance. 
Slide 7 
Introductions: Where are YOU on the Cash Flow 
Management Continuum? 
Before we go on and learn more about Bob’s cash flow 
experiences it will be helpful to learn your backgrounds and 
experiences so far with cash flow management.  
Facilitation Note: 
 Ask the participants to briefly introduce themselves and 
their experiences so far with cash flow management – 
from beginner to expert. 
 
 
 Validate each person’s experience level as valid.  
 Encourage the experts in the class to offer ideas and 
examples from their experience to the rest of the group.

Note:  This balance sheet lists pre-opening expenses as current assets.  In this example, the 
pre-opening expenses listed were expensed or realized before the end of the 
year.  Entrepreneurs should always keep track of pre-opening expenses as some may or may 
not be considered by financial institutions or investors as a business asset or owner 
investment/equity.

Opening Balance Sheet for The Wired Cup, Cont. 
 
This opening balance sheet tells a story: how much money Bob 
had to start his business, how he financed it, what he did with that 
money, and how much was left over to run the business.  
The balance sheet tells us that Bob invested $30,000 of his own 
money or owner’s equity, and he borrowed $20,000. The $20,000 
loan is over five years, with an 14.54% interest rate. In year one, 
Bob will pay back $3,371 of principal and will pay the remaining 
balance of $16,629 in years two through five.  
If you do not have the necessary capital to start your business, you 
have two options to get the capital that you need:  
• Equity. Friends, family and/or business partners invest in your 
business. They provide you with cash; you give them equity or 
a piece of the business. 
• Debt. You borrow the money from family, friends, or a lending 
institution, such as a bank. You do not give up equity or 
ownership but you do have to pay back the loan. You will pay 
back both principal and interest. There are many types of 
lending or borrowing options.  
Slide 9 
A Few Notes About Debt 
 
It takes some effort to obtain a small business loan. As part 
of the process you will need to provide a business plan. The 
Money Smart for Small Business module, Planning for a 
Healthy Business provides a lot of information about various 
ways to plan a successful business.  
Know your credit score. The higher your score the lower the 
risk for creditors. For more information, attend the Money 
Smart module on Credit Reporting.  
Banks have differing criteria for lending. Talk with your local 
bankers before you need a loan. The stronger your 
relationship, the more supportive they will be to help you 
secure a loan if you meet their lending criteria. The Money 
Smart module on Banking Services can help. Be prepared to 
personally sign for the loan. If a business is unable to meet 
its financial obligations, you will be held responsible. Also be 
prepared to pledge collateral.  
One last note: manage your credit cards to avoid high fees 
and interest. Business credit cards may be one of the most 
expensive forms of business credit.

Presentation Guidelines 
Back to the Opening Balance Sheet  
Slide 10 (This slide is 
intentionally repeated – it is the 
same as slide 8.) 
In total, Bob had $50,000 to spend to open The Wired Cup. 
He spent $45,000 on equipment, materials, and other assets 
as indicated on the balance sheet ($29,500 fixed assets and 
$15,500 for current assets = $45,000). 
He had $5,000 cash remaining to run his business ($50,000 
-$45,000 = $5,000).  
If I were Bob’s lender, a potential business partner, or a 
vendor, I would look at this opening balance sheet and ask 
the following:  
• Has he invested enough of his own money in this venture? 
 
 
• Did he finance the business wisely? For instance, does he carry 
too much debt? The terms and time requirements for loan 
repayment can make a huge impact on cash flow. 
• Did he wisely spend the $50,000? 
 
• Is there enough available cash left over to run the business? Is 
$5,000 enough to carry him through a six month period?  
 
 
 
 
 
 
We do not have time to discuss these questions and the 
answers in detail. I am just explaining that an opening 
balance sheet tells a story which can prompt constructive 
dialogues with stakeholders.  
A balance sheet tells a story, but it is just the first chapter. The 
story continues on into the cash flow statement.  
 
Clarify and Transition 
 
Are there any more questions about opening balance sheets 
before we move on?

Slide 11 
Three Views of Cash Flow 
Let’s look at three views of cash flow: a cash conversion 
cycle, a cash flow diagram, and The Wired Cup’s cash flow 
statement. 
Combined together, these three views provide a 
comprehensive overview of a cash flow system.  
 
 
 
Slide 12 
The Cash Conversion Cycle 
A cash conversion cycle consists of three components:  
1. A business pays for raw materials.  
2. The business makes a product or service using those 
materials.  
3. The business sells products or services.  
 
 
The trick is to know how long it will take to complete the 
cycle. That rate of conversion impacts cash flow.  
If you have a short cycle, you sell inventory or turn it back 
into cash quickly, which puts money back into the cash flow 
system. 
If you have a long cash conversion cycle you will not be able 
to use that money while inventory is sitting on your shelves.  
 
 
 
Slide 13 
The Cash Flow Diagram 
Another way to describe cash flow is with a diagram, like the 
one on page 7 in your Participant Guide. Page 8 provides 
descriptions of the elements that make up this diagram. 
We will review this diagram to get a big picture of cash flow 
and how all the elements – the pipes and valves– work 
together.

Cash Flow Diagram Descriptions 
 
 
 
 
 
This diagram is a representation of how cash flows in and out 
of the system. It depicts many decision points or valves you 
control. 
When you start a business, money flows into the business via 
debt or equity. In the case of The Wired Cup, Bob had 
$30,000 of his own money invested in the business, the 
equity bucket in this diagram. In addition, Bob borrowed 
$20,000, the debt bucket. The combined $50,000 is the 
available cash working capital.  
The valves in this cash flow diagram represent decision 
points. Your decisions impact cash flow and increase or 
decrease your probability of success. 
Some valves are open all the time such as sales taxes and 
debt. You have to pay them. They are a constant drain on 
your cash, which is why they are on the bottom.  
Some valves are partially open, like the sales, general, and 
administrative valves. What you spend is up to you. As you 
spend available cash, the balance in the center tank drops.  
Inventory. You spend money on raw materials, labor, and 
other direct costs to produce a product to sell -- assuming 
you are producing a product; the same principles apply for 
services as well. If you spend a lot on inventory you tie up 
your money until you sell the inventory, and turn it into cash.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fixed assets are usually expensive: buildings, upgrades to 
space, vehicles, equipment, computers, and technology. If 
you purchase an expensive fixed asset, it ties up cash. A 
better option may be to lease to keep cash flowing.  
Profit generator (sales pump). In the top left corner, we 
have a sales pump. Keep this primed to pump sales back into 
the system.  
Accounts receivable (A/R). You may make a sale, but not 
receive the cash until you collect it. Ultimately you want to 
convert A/R into cash, so it flows into the center tank and 
becomes available. Some A/R will not be paid; this is called 
bad debt. Usually after 90 days, an A/R will not be paid. 
When you extend credit and create an A/R, you need to 
follow up to ensure you receive the payment.  
Accounts payable (A/P). In the center tank, accounts 
payable are represented by bricks. This is money owed to 
vendors and suppliers who extend credit to you. For 
example, you receive a product or service but you have not 
yet paid for it. You still have use of that money. The bricks 
elevate the water. Instead of having to pay for a product or 
service, you can use that money for marketing or paying

another bill. 
It is challenging to balance accounts payable and accounts 
receivable. You want customers to pay you as quickly as 
possible (cash in) and you want to pay your vendors as slowly 
as possible (cash out).  
Ultimately, you want to have and be generating excess cash 
flow from profitable operations or ECFPO. The 
showerhead represents your paycheck.  
The broken pipe represents how depreciation can be used to 
reduce your taxable income. We won’t get into this in this 
class for time management issues. This is a good question to 
share with an accountant. 
This diagram represents a cash flow system and decision 
points you control. Of course, in business we would not use a 
diagram. We use a statement which tells a story with 
numbers.  
 
The Cash Flow Statement  
 
 
 
A copy of the cash flow 
statement is provided on the

The Cash Flow Statement, cont. 
 
 
 
The cash flow statement is a valuable decision making tool 
for business owners, investors, and creditors. It allows 
everyone to make smart, informed decisions about your 
business. 
In this example, Bob made projections based on two months 
of actual experience in August and September. He does not 
know how much seasonality --summer vacations at the 
college-- will affect business. He assumes the impact will be 
significant. 
The first column lists money in categories such as loan 
receipts, owner’s capital, and so on, and money out such as 
operating expenses for accounting, accounts payable/debt, 
advertising, and so on. 
The second column represents Bob’s opening balance sheet 
start-up costs. You would not typically see this on a cash 
flow statement. We include this information to demonstrate 
how elements of an opening balance sheet transfer over to 
the cash flow statement.  
The rest of the columns represent monthly income and 
expenses. As mentioned before, Bob has had two months of 
actual expenses. Based on what he knows so far, he projected 
income and expenses for the rest of the year. 
Notice that Bob had $5,000 in available cash. His sales were 
$25,000, and sales tax was $1,563. 
• A note about sales tax. Put this in a separate bank 
account. Do not co-mingle tax money in your regular 
bank account. You are collecting tax on behalf of the 
government. This is not your money to use. Most likely, 
you will be required to pay this quarterly or even 
monthly to the government. The payroll taxes rate used 
in this example is 15%.  You will need to determine the 
appropriate local, state, and applicable federal taxes. 
 
In August, The Wired Cup had a total inflow of cash: $26,563 
($25,000 of sales revenue plus $1,563 of sales tax). That 
means that at the end of August, Bob’s total available cash 
was $31,563 ($5,000 + $26,563 = $31,563).  
If we look at the bottom of the spreadsheet for August we see 
that $29,253 was the cash out flow for the month. 
• Some cash outflows are fixed month to month, such as Bob’s 
lease payment of $1,350 and the cable/Internet payment of 
$200.  
• Some cash outflows are variable, such as advertising and 
MANAGING CASH FLOW INSTRUCTOR GUIDE 
Page 66 of 92 
 
MSSB Train-the-Trainer Workshop, Participant Guide 
 
 
Instructor Notes 
Presentation Guidelines    
utilities. Variable amounts fluctuate from month to month. 
You have some control over how cash flows in and out of 
your business. For example, for sales you decide what you 
will sell, where, to whom, how, and at what price. The same 
goes for expenses. You can decide what space to lease, how 
much debt to carry, when to advertise, when and how much 
raw materials to purchase, and how many staff to employ.  
In August, Bob has available cash of $31,563 and cash 
outflows of $29,253. $31,563 - $29,253 = $2,309 in his bank 
account at the end of August. This $2,309 becomes the 
beginning balance for the month of September, and the 
process starts all over again.  
• In September: $2,309 + $27,000 + 1,688 = $30,997 available 
cash for September. Monthly expenses are $29,778. $30,997 - 
$29,778 = $1,218 cash available at the end of September, 
which becomes the beginning balance for October. 
To sum up: Bob is happy. The Wired Cup is doing well, but 
he is worried about the rest of the year. He projects he will be 
able to pay all of his financial obligations but he will be 
cutting it close.  
Some business owners overestimate revenue and 
underestimate costs. This means they will at some point have 
a cash flow crunch and will not have cash available to meet 
their obligations. To prevent this, consider developing a 
couple of cash flow statements:  
• Best case scenario: This would be an ideal situation where all 
your dreams come true. 
• Worst case scenario: This would be a much more conservative 
scenario where you do not get the sales revenue you would 
hope for and costs are higher.  
• Most likely: This would be like the Goldilocks story—not too 
hot, not too cold, but just right. It is the most likely scenario, 
somewhere between a best and worst case. 
In this example, Bob created a most likely projection. Given 
that he knows the students and faculty leave for vacation, in 
July he projects a negative $4,316.  
You can’t have a negative cash situation! Negative cash 
means game over.  
What you want to achieve is excess cash flow from profitable 
operations. This is when you can shower yourself with some 
cash.

Slide 15 
What Can Bob Do?  
Please turn to page 11 of the Participant Guide. Bob needs to 
turn some valves wide open and turn down others in order to 
hold on to his cash as long as possible. If you were Bob’s 
advisors, what would you advise him to do? 
• How can Bob increase sales revenue at The Wired 
Cup? 
 
• How could Bob negotiate a better deal or two with his 
vendors and suppliers? 
 
 
• How can Bob plan for the seasonal ups and downs in 
his business? 
• Is it wise for Bob to use a credit card to offset cash 
flow issues? 
Facilitation Note: 
 
 These questions motivate the participants to think 
through common cash flow management scenarios. 
 
 
Slide 16 
 Thank participants for their ideas and suggestions. 
 After the participants have a chance to offer 
suggestions, reveal the next slide which provides 
some answers. 
 
Possible Ideas for Bob 
Note that some of the ideas you suggested are on this slide. 
Nice job advising Bob! 
• Bob can increase the flow of revenue into his business.  
 
 
• Bob can reduce outflow, perhaps by making arrangements with 
vendors or his landlord. If Bob pays his entire rent in 10 
months he will pay more during the 10 busy months and no 
rent in July and August which promise to be slow.  
• Bob might cut back when he expects business to slow down. 
Perhaps his staff can work fewer hours or he can cut back on 
menu items.  
The point is that by managing cash flow, Bob is able to 
control his business over the long term. He can be strategic 
and plan ahead.

Summary, Post-Test, and Evaluation 
Slide 17 
What NOT to Do  
 
Never use your sales tax as a financing option. Some business 
owners use sales tax in a cash crunch hoping they replace the 
tax when things look up. This is a risky bet. Penalties are 
high for not paying taxes on time.  
If you anticipate that you might miss or be late on a loan 
payment, talk to your loan officer as soon as you know. Loan 
officers understand cash flow and typical business 
challenges. It is in their interest to help. They don’t want to 
see you fail. They make money when you are successful and 
pay back the principal and loan interest.  
• Do not pay vendors late; they can cut off supply. 
• Do not overestimate revenue. This is a common mistake 
many new business owners tend to make. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Slide 18 
• Do not underestimate costs. Again, this is a common 
mistake in start-up businesses. Do your homework to find 
out the real costs of doing business. 
It Is Professional to Ask for Help 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
It is not a sign of weakness if financial management is new 
for you.  Find a great accountant or technical advisor at 
SBDC or SCORE who can explain cash flow in ways that 
relate the concepts to your own business.  
An accountant will encourage you to use a computer to 
manage your cash flow documentation. If you do not already 
use financial management software, take a course to develop 
this skill. You also need to manage your paperwork in a 
professional manner. Set up a reliable filing system to keep 
track of all financial documents such as tax forms, receipts, 
invoices, and so on. 
“Co-opetition”is a real term. Competitors can be good 
advisors as they cope with the same cash flow issues you do. 
Find ways to cooperate and share information with them. 
They have experience to share. 
Check out the Toolkit of Resources in your Participant Guide 
for ideas about where to locate technical assistance.

Slide 19 
Key Points to Remember  
• Managing cash flow is a core competency of small business 
ownership. 
• A balance sheet tells a compelling story. A cash flow statement 
continues that story. Use it to monitor projected and actual 
income and expenses. 
 
• Plan for seasonal fluctuations. Every business has ups and 
downs. Ask some of your competitors when their usual slow 
times tend to occur. 
 
 
 
• Try to maintain a rapid cash conversion cycle. Try not to tie up 
too much cash in inventory. Lease equipment instead of buying 
it. If you do buy equipment, buy used whenever you can. 
 
 
 
• Manage your paperwork like a pro. Your accountant will 
expect to see spreadsheets, an accounting program, well-
organized receipts, invoices, and financial statements such as 
banking and credit card statements. 
 
Slide 20
• Ask an accountant for advice. Ideally this class has helped you 
prepare for a series of helpful conversations.  
 
Toolkit of Resources 
The Toolkit in the back of your Participant Guide provides 
helpful information such as:  
• A glossary of common cash flow terms. 
 
• A sample cash flow template (get the complete template 
online). 
 
• Tips for negotiating better terms with customers, vendors and 
suppliers, and landlords. 
• A list of great resources where you can get more information. 
Many of these are free or very inexpensive.

resource has 13 modules, is available for download and in Spanish.   A list of 
MSSB Alliance members is available at the FDIC website and is updated 
periodically as a reference for organizations or individuals that want to know 
who is offering MSSB near them.  There is no cost, and it takes minutes to join 
the Alliance by completing a short online form. MSSB Alliance members 
convene on a quarterly basis to share their experiences on MSSB Town Hall 
conference calls.

Sample Instruction Planner 
 
Consider creating an instruction planner like the sample below. In this example, the trainer is responsible for 
setting up and processing activities that reinforce the topics. The expert is responsible for delivering information 
on the topics. They share responsibility for implementing the pre-and post-test assessments. This example 
balances content (knowledge to be shared) and process (participants apply the knowledge to their own 
businesses). In order for a plan like this to work, the trainer and the expert need to agree ahead of time on who 
will handle what.

Success Tips 
 
The MSSB Train-the-Trainer instructors/facilitators should have relevant instructor/facilitator skills and 
experience. The FDIC may conduct orientation workshops to familiarize potential instructors with the 
curriculum, but neither the FDIC nor SBA certifies trainers to deliver the MSSB curriculum.  
 
As an instructor, you are responsible for: 
 
• Identifying the learning and communication needs of participants 
• Focusing and directing participants 
• Aiming discussions toward course objectives 
• Making sure every participant has the opportunity to contribute to the discussion 
 
You can accomplish these objectives by listening, asking questions, observing participants’ reactions and leading 
by example. 
 
A first step to delivering an effective presentation is to know your audience. You must understand the goals of 
the course and why the participants need this information. Tips for delivering effective presentations include: 
 
• Know your material well. Thoroughly review ALL of the training materials. 
• Identify potential trouble spots in the exercises, as well as hints for assisting participants. 
• Practice your presentation. 
• Use language familiar to the participants, avoiding jargon or unfamiliar terms. 
• Select and prepare anecdotes from real-world experiences that can be used to illustrate special 
scenarios, generate discussion and maintain participant interest. 
• Speak clearly. 
• Be aware of the tone and pace of how you are speaking. 
• Avoid going off on tangents and getting off track during a presentation. 
• Minimize the use of filler words (such as “uh” and “um”). 
• Make eye contact with participants. 
• Use natural and positive body language and facial expressions. 
• Avoid fidgeting, pacing and other nervous habits. 
• Be yourself. 
• Make sufficient copies of the Participant Guide and handouts. 
• If using an LCD projector, make sure beforehand that all computer equipment is functioning and 
prepare a backup hardcopy of the PowerPoint slides for use during the training. 
• Give yourself ample time to set up the classroom and distribute participant materials before the 
training is scheduled to take place. 
 
A successful instructor must be able to introduce activities, assign participants to small groups, give instructions 
and process activity results. When introducing activities, explain the objectives, and emphasize the benefits and 
potential outcomes of the learning activity. Connect, or link, activities to previously learned concepts and 
discussions.

Materials and Equipment Needed 
 
• Train-the-Trainer Instructor Guide. 
• Train-the-Trainer Participant Guide. Print one for each participant and one for the trainer to be used 
as a reference. The Train-the-Trainer participant guide should be printed on two two-sides.  
• Train-the-Trainer PowerPoint. This should be customized ahead of time, especially if the training 
includes various sponsoring organizations and/or speakers.  
• Laptop or computer loaded with the PowerPoint presentation. It isn’t necessary to share the slides 
with participants. All of the information that’s needed is in their Participant Guides. As a best 
practice, be prepared for technical issues. Print a few sets of the slides ahead of time and bring a 
thumb drive with your presentation just in case. 
• Chart paper and markers for recording responses to key questions and/or to create a Parking Lot for 
questions you might not be able to answer in class. Chart paper can be created ahead of time. 
• Slide projector, screen or monitor/TV to display the PowerPoint presentation. 
• (Optional) Stopwatch or other timer. 
• (Optional) Painter’s tape for posting chart pages on the wall. 
• (Optional) Post-it Notes and highlighters that participants can use to flag or highlight key information 
in their Train-the-Trainer Participant Guides. 
 
The Instructor Guide is your roadmap for presenting the Train-the-Trainer workshop. It includes: 
 
• The purpose and objectives of the Train-the-Trainer workshop and the curriculum 
• A detailed lesson plan  
• Thumbnails of the overhead slides  
• Additional information that’s not part of the Train-the-Trainer Participant Guide. 
 
The lesson plan is laid out in a two-column format. The left-hand column contains the slides used in the 
presentation. The right-hand column contains a word-for-word script of the module content, as well as more 
lengthy instructions for delivering the content and conducting the practice exercises.  
 
Each module includes a set of visuals to help you present the module content. They are presented in both 
PowerPoint and PDF formats so you can use them with your specific projection equipment.  
 
You should give each student a Participant Guide to use during the training and as a reference when the training 
is over. It contains: 
 
• Important concepts and facts presented in the Train-the-Trainer workshop. 
• The evaluation form 
• Space for taking notes 
• (Optional) Additional ready-to-use resources such as the MSSB Flyer, Agenda, Invitation and 
Worksheet Templates to be used during Train-the-Trainer workshops 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                          Page 81 of 92 
 
MSSB Train-the-Trainer Workshop, Participant Guide 
 
Giving Instructions 
 
The Instructor Guide provides instructions for all the activities in the modules. However, participants may still 
need clarification. It’s important to speak clearly and slowly when presenting the objectives of an activity and 
giving instructions. Make sure to define important terms and concepts (refer to the MSSB TtT glossary) and, 
when possible, demonstrate activities or provide examples for the participants. Also, periodically ask if there are 
any questions. 
 
While students are completing an activity, you should circulate to answer questions and encourage discussion. 
Keep track of the amount of time allotted for each activity, and inform the students when time is winding down. 
 
When processing results, ask questions about how the participants reached their conclusions. Keep the 
processing from becoming redundant or repetitive by asking the next group to report findings that are different 
from the previous group’s or by asking each group to present just a part of the solution. 
 
When processing individual comments, make sure a diverse group of students is called on to provide responses. 
Encourage students with different experience levels and perspectives to contribute their observations. 
Acknowledge correct responses and provide alternative approaches if incomplete or inaccurate responses are 
given. 
 
Facilitating Discussions 
 
Interaction among students contributes to a successful learning experience. Varying the composition of small 
groups for exercises and activities not only energizes students, but also creates more opportunity to exchange 
information and encounter different perspectives. 
 
There are a number of techniques for assigning students to small groups. Common methods include telling 
students to partner with someone they don’t know or counting off by a specific number and having all the “ones” 
work together, all the “twos” work together, and so on. Other ways include arbitrarily grouping people who are 
close to each other or asking students to turn their chairs around to form groups with people at the next table. 
 
Informative discussions and exchange of information among instructors and students are other keys to the 
success of this course. As an instructor, your role is to elicit comments from the students while maintaining the 
focus of the discussion. The following tips may be useful when you are leading group discussions: 
 
• Paraphrase what someone has said so the participant will know he or she has been understood and to 
ensure the rest of the class hears the comment. 
• Compliment students on interesting or insightful comments. 
• Use open-ended questions, because they trigger better discussions than close-ended ones. 
• Mediate differences of opinions. 
• Pull ideas together, showing their relationship to one another. 
• Summarize, and record on chart paper, if appropriate, the major views of the group. 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                          Page 82 of 92 
 
MSSB Train-the-Trainer Workshop, Participant Guide 
 
Classroom Set-Up 
 
The most effective classroom set-up is to arrange the room into table groups that seat four to six students each. 
This allows students to complete the small group exercises comfortably. If this arrangement is not possible, you 
may have to move desks and chairs into small groups to conduct these activities.  
 
Using Chart Paper 
 
Chart paper lets you capture meaningful information generated by discussion and display it for all students to 
see. When using chart paper: 
 
• Prepare chart paper in advance. 
• Prepare titles beforehand if students will provide responses. 
• Write with large, clear, bold letters, using 20 words per page as your guide. 
• Use words or short phrases to indicate key ideas. 
• Check your spelling. 
• Write, turn to the audience and then talk; don’t talk while writing. 
• Don’t obstruct students’ view of the chart. 
• Leave the bottom quarter of the paper blank so all of the content can be seen by those in the back of 
the room. 
• Tear off chart paper you want the group to be able to refer to throughout the course, and post it on the 
walls around the classroom. 
 
Using Handouts 
 
Like other types of materials, handouts help vary the pace of training sessions by giving students a different 
focus. Reinforce the connection between handouts and course content by introducing and reviewing them. When 
using handouts: 
 
• Prepare the appropriate number of copies ahead of time. 
• Make sure your handout is concise and designed for easy reading. 
• Use colored paper to make locating the handouts easier if they’ll be referred to frequently during the 
course. 
• Make sure you distribute handouts to each student before beginning to discuss their content. 
• Don’t distribute handouts as you are speaking; students will focus on the materials rather than what 
you are saying. 
 
Using Visual Aids 
 
These tips for using visual aids will help you to be an effective presenter: 
 
• Keep visual aids out of sight until you are ready to use them. 
• Stand to the side of your visual aid. 
                                                                                                                                                                                                          Page 83 of 92 
 
MSSB Train-the-Trainer Workshop, Participant Guide 
• Talk to and face the audience, not the visual aid. 
• Don’t block your face with the visual aid. 
• Maintain eye contact with your audience. 
• Make sure your audience has the time to fully read and understand the visual aid before removing it 
and moving to the next one. 
• Know where the visual aid goes when you’re finished using it. 
• Switch the projector off when not in use; its noise and light can be distracting. 
 
It’s helpful to practice using visual aids before delivering the actual presentation. All visual aids should be free 
of grammatical errors and clutter. When presenting visual aids, describe the content and add a few anecdotes or 
meaningful details. Visual aids should not be read verbatim. 
 
Consider the Three Learning Styles While Teaching 
 
Experts know that most people learn best in one of three ways:  
 
• Visual: Those who learn best by seeing how things are done.  
• Use visual aids, such as handouts, slides, written instructions, charts and demonstrations.  
• Stand to the side, talk to and face the audience, allow the audience time to fully read and 
understand.  
• Prepare charts in advance, using large, clear, bold letters. Write, turn to the audience, and then 
talk.  
• Design handouts for easy reading, and use colored paper to make locating handouts easier. 
 
• Auditory: Those who learn best by listening or hearing instructions.  
• They are affective learners, that is, they tend to be more intuitive than rational. Therefore, they 
have to feel the learning experience.  
• They like to get involved with others and share ideas and information.  
• They like thinking out loud about what they are learning.  
• Use exercises that allow them to share their experiences with each other. Lectures and audio 
tapes are also useful for auditory learners. 
 
• Tactile/Kinesthetic: Those who learn best by doing. 
• They like to experiment.  
• They dislike conventional educational approaches.  
• They get bored with lectures, presentations or anything that doesn’t allow them to be 
physically active.  
• They learn best from hands-on training and physically active exercises. 
 
Things to Avoid During a Presentation 
 
You can lose the interest of students by doing any of the following: 
 
• Failing to prepare 
• Reading verbatim from notes or a script 
• Teaching without student involvement 
                                                                                                                                                                                                          Page 84 of 92 
 
MSSB Train-the-Trainer Workshop, Participant Guide 
• Diverging from course objectives 
• Avoiding eye contact 
• Using confusing visual aids 
• Behaving in a condescending or superior manner 
• Using jargon or language that’s either too simple or complex for participants 
• Lacking empathy for participants’ needs 
• Using offensive or critical humor 
• Making promises you can’t deliver 
 
Questions for Self-Reflection 
 
Here are some potential challenges you may face. How would you deal with them? 
 
• You have made promises you cannot deliver 
• You are asked a question and you do not know the answer 
• Fewer or more people show up than anticipated 
• Someone is sleeping 
• Someone brought a baby who constantly cries 
• No one responds to your questions 
• One person monopolizes the discussion

Accommodating Students with Disabilities 
 
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990  
 
On July 26, 1990, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) became law. The law is designed to protect the 
civil rights of people with disabilities. The ADA prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability by 
guaranteeing equal opportunity for individuals with disabilities in public accommodations, commercial facilities, 
employment, transportation, state and local government services, and telecommunications. 
The ADA is built on the principles of equal opportunity, full participation, independent living and economic self-
sufficiency. It reflects the disability community’s determination to participate fully in the life of their community 
like other citizens and to have choice and control over their own futures. It’s the most comprehensive policy 
statement ever made in law in the United States about how the nation should address individuals with 
disabilities. 
As a civil rights law, the ADA is similar to other civil rights acts that protect individuals from being 
discriminated against based on arbitrary criteria such as race, color, religion, age, national origin and sex. For 
other groups with civil rights protection, the problem has generally been discrimination through policies that 
limit their participation.  
For people with disabilities, discrimination often also takes the form of inaccessible facilities that make it 
impossible for them to gain access to or participate in “standard” activities. For example, stairs leading to the 
only entrance into a building prohibit entry by someone who uses a wheelchair. Similarly, texts and handouts 
provided only on paper and in standard-size typeface are inaccessible to someone who is blind or has low vision. 
In these cases, the ADA requires changes to buildings or locations, and modifications to the way products or 
services are provided. 
Making the modules useful and understandable for everyone, regardless of whether or not they have a disability, 
is perhaps the best reason of all for making the courses accessible.  
Low- and moderate-income individuals, especially those with little or no banking experience, often don’t have 
the tools necessary to save and manage money. This lack of a basic understanding of how money works in our 
society may keep them from achieving financial independence. These individuals also include a significant 
number of persons with lifelong disabilities, as well as older individuals who acquire disabilities as they age. 
Some may have undiagnosed or hidden learning disabilities.  
 
Requests for Accommodations 
 
You may want to consider using a registration form with a space where individuals can indicate whether they 
need any accommodations and, if so, what types of accommodations may be required. You may also want to ask 
if students require materials in alternate formats.  
People with disabilities are never required to self-identify as having a disability – even if the disability is 
obvious. Therefore, the registration form should not ask the individual to specifically identify the type of 
disability. That information is not necessary for you to know, and asking for it could be viewed as a type of 
discrimination.   
                                                                                                                                                                                                          Page 86 of 92 
 
MSSB Train-the-Trainer Workshop, Participant Guide 
However, providing a space on the registration form to request accommodations is neutral and welcoming. It’s 
also a good idea for you to ask all of the students for a way to contact them, by phone and by email, so that you 
can communicate with people individually if you have questions about any part of the registration form. Put the 
request for contact information in the body of the registration form – not in the place where you ask if 
accommodations are needed.  
 
How to Make Classes Accessible to Students with Disabilities 
 
There are many things that both you and the sponsoring agency can do to make the modules accessible to people 
with a wide range of disabilities. An overview of actions that can be taken to ensure accessibility follows. 
 
Nondiscrimination 
Qualified individuals with disabilities cannot be denied participation simply because of their disability. You can 
limit participation in your course to individuals who meet some general criteria – such as being over the age of 
62 or unemployed – but if an individual qualifies on those grounds, she or he may not be denied participation 
because of a disability. 
 
Physical Access 
When deciding where to hold the class, look for a location that is accessible for people who use wheelchairs or 
scooters or who have other difficulties walking or climbing stairs. People with mobility limitations need to be 
able to get into the building without using steps or crossing over a high object. If the main entrance is not 
accessible, a sign should be posted there indicating the location of the closest accessible entrance. Classes should 
be held on the upper floors of a building only if they can be reached by an elevator. The building should also 
have at least one “unisex” accessible restroom. 
Other physical access issues to consider in determining the location of the classrooms are clearly marked 
accessible parking spaces located close to the accessible entrance, Braille signage on the elevator call buttons 
and on the buttons inside the elevators, and raised letters and Braille signage identifying the restrooms. The 
elevators should also have chimes or a recorded voice indicating the different floors.  
In the classroom itself, check to be sure that there is at least 32 inches of clear space in the aisles and along the 
edges of the seating area. This is how much space someone using a wheelchair needs to move freely around the 
room. If you are using individual desks and chairs and someone who uses a wheelchair enters the room, ask that 
person if you should move one of the desks or if she or he prefers to transfer from the wheelchair to the desk 
chair. Always ask; never assume. People with a disability know what works best for them. 
Similarly, if the room is arranged like a classroom with long tables and individual chairs, it’s always a good idea 
to remove one or two of the chairs from the ends of rows in different areas of the room before the class starts, so 
that individuals using wheelchairs or scooters can have a choice of seating arrangements – the same way that 
others in the class have a choice about where they want to sit. 
 
Effective Communication 
 
Some individuals have disabilities that affect their ability to communicate – for example, people who are blind or 
have low vision or people who are deaf or hearing impaired. Other disabilities that affect communication include 
cognitive or learning disabilities that may impact the ability to read. People who have cognitive disabilities or 
learning disabilities may have difficulty reading written material.  
                                                                                                                                                                                                          Page 87 of 92 
 
MSSB Train-the-Trainer Workshop, Participant Guide 
 
Under the ADA, both private and public entities are required to communicate effectively with individuals with 
disabilities. The obligation to communicate effectively applies to the presentation and exchange of information 
in all forms, including sound, print, graphics and speech.  
 
The law says that people with communication disabilities are entitled to appropriate “aids and services where 
necessary to ensure effective communications.” With respect to the Money Smart courses, these aids and 
services could include: 
 
• Assisting someone with cognitive or learning disabilities by reading aloud the pre- and post-course tests; or 
• Helping someone with a disability write their answers to the tests or complete other Money Smart forms; 
or 
• Making sure not to turn your back on someone who is lip reading; or 
• Wearing a lapel microphone or using a handheld microphone to amplify what is being said for persons 
who use hearing aids or auxiliary listening devices; or 
• Making sure that any videos used in class are captioned for people who are deaf or hard of hearing and that 
written material presented on screen is read aloud, either by the narrator on the video or by the course 
instructor.  
 
Sometimes communication assistance can include providing a sign language interpreter, upon request, if doing 
so does not result in an undue burden. Undue burden is defined in the ADA as “significant difficulty or 
expense.” However, even if providing a sign language interpreter or some other type of communication 
assistance is an undue burden, you still are expected, if at all feasible, to provide some other type of assistance, 
such as a copy of the Instructor Guide, so that a person who is deaf or hard of hearing can follow along as the 
class is taught. 
Some people with visual disabilities have difficulty reading standard-size text or viewing materials projected on 
the overhead screen. Copies of the slides for each module can be printed out and given to these individuals to 
use as you present the course content. Similarly, handouts used during the course can sometimes be difficult to 
handle for people who have difficulty using their hands and fingers.  
Other people may have difficulty hearing what you are saying. If individuals can read lips, allow them to sit in 
the front where they can have an unobstructed view of your face. If you are using an overhead projector, make 
sure that you continue to face the students as you cover the major points. Keep your Instructor Manual open to 
the individual slides, or, better still, print out a copy of the overhead materials so that you can read the text on 
the slides without turning your head away from the person who has the hearing impairment. When there is class 
discussion or when someone asks a question, repeat what has been said so that the person lip reading can be part 
of the discussion.  
Some individuals with significant speech disabilities use an augmentative communication device that uses a 
computer to produce synthesized speech. When they want to ask a question or contribute to the class discussion, 
they use a keyboard to key in what they want to say. Since keying in the content can take a few moments, you 
can acknowledge their intention to speak, saying something like, “Yes, Mr. Jones, we’ll get to you as soon as 
you are ready,” and then making certain that you do go back to him as soon as the keying in is completed. (Most 
keyboards make a small beep as each word or phrase is keyed in.) However, during an interaction between the 
person with the disability and another individual, etiquette demands that you wait respectfully until the 
comments are keyed in and played.  
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                          Page 88 of 92

Guidelines for Talking About Disabilities 
 
Here are some guidelines that will help you communicate with your students who have disabilities in ways that 
won’t offend them: 
 
• Do not refer to a person's disability unless it is relevant. 
• Use “disability” rather than “handicap” to refer to a person’s disability, if indeed you need to refer to it. 
It’s okay to say that a person is handicapped by obstacles, such as architectural barriers or the attitudes of 
ignorant or insensitive people. Never use “cripple/crippled” in any reference to disability. 
• When referring to a person’s disability, use “people first” language. In other words, when necessary, say 
“person with a disability” rather than “a disabled person”. Since “disabled” is an adjective, it’s important 
to avoid ridiculous and improper constructions such as “disabled group” or “disabled transportation.’ 
Instead, build phrases using the word “disability.” For example, “disability activist,” or “disability 
community,” are correct and not contradictions to the “people first” ideas. 
• Never refer to people with disabilities as “the disabled, the blind, the epileptics, a quadriplegic,” etc. 
Descriptive terms should be used as adjectives, not as nouns. 
• Never use the word “retarded” or the phrase “mental retardation”. You can use “intellectual disability” or 
“cognitive impairment”. 
• Avoid negative or sensational descriptions of a person’s disability. Don’t say “suffers from,” “a victim 
of,” or “afflicted with.” Don’t refer to people with disabilities as “patients” unless they are receiving 
treatment in a medical facility. Never say “invalid.” Treat people with disabilities with respect and 
acceptance. 
• Don’t portray people with disabilities as overly courageous, brave, special or superhuman. This implies 
that it’s unusual for people with disabilities to have talents or skills. 
• Don't use “normal” to describe people who don't have disabilities. It is better to say “people without 
disabilities” if necessary to make comparisons. 
• Never say “wheelchair-bound” or “confined to a wheelchair.”. 
• Never assume that a person with a communication disorder (speech impediment, hearing loss, motor 
impairment) also has a cognitive disability. 
 
10 Commandments of Etiquette for Interacting with People with Disabilities  
 
1. When talking with a person with a disability, speak directly to that person rather than through a 
companion or sign language interpreter.  
2. When introduced to a person with a disability, it is appropriate to offer to shake hands. People with limited 
hand use or who wear an artificial limb can usually shake hands. (Shaking hands with the left hand is an 
acceptable greeting.)  
3. When meeting a person who is visually impaired, always identify yourself and others who may be with 
you. When conversing in a group, remember to identify the person to whom you are speaking.  
4. Don’t be afraid to ask questions when you're unsure of what to do. If you offer assistance, wait until the 
offer is accepted. Then listen to or ask for instructions.  
5. Treat adults as adults. Address people who have disabilities by their first names only when extending the 
same familiarity to all others. Never patronize people who use wheelchairs by patting them on the head or 
shoulder.  
6. Leaning on or hanging on to a person’s wheelchair is similar to leaning on hanging on to a person and is 
generally considered annoying. The chair is part of the personal body space of the person who uses it.  
                                                                                                                                                                                                          Page 89 of 92

7. Listen attentively when you're talking with a person who has difficulty speaking. Be patient and wait for 
the person to finish, rather than correcting or speaking for the person. If necessary, ask short questions that 
require short answers, a nod or shake of the head. Never pretend to understand if you are having difficulty 
doing so. Instead, repeat what you have understood and allow the person to respond. The response will 
clue you in and guide your understanding.  
8. When speaking with a person who uses a wheelchair or a person who uses crutches, place yourself at eye 
level in front of the person to facilitate the conversation.  
9. To get the attention of a person who is deaf, tap the person on the shoulder or wave your hand. Look 
directly at the person and speak clearly, slowly, and expressively to determine if the person can read your 
lips. Not all people who are deaf can read lips. For those who read lips, be sensitive to their needs by 
placing yourself so that you face the light source, and keep hands, cigarettes and food away from your 
mouth when speaking.  
10. Relax. Don't be embarrassed if you happen to use accepted, common expressions such as “See you later,” 
or “Did you hear about that?” that seem to relate to a person's disability.
