Boston's New Problem: Stop Emerging Girl Gang "Epidemic"  
Boston Herald, May 12, 2006 
According to the Boston Herald, Boston Mayor Thomas Menino is ordering new steps to stop the  
violence between gangs of young girls, including the addition of female police detectives to a special 
unit. The rise in violent crimes committed by teenage girls who associate or travel in loosely organized 
groups prompted Commissioner Kathleen O’Toole to ask for more female cops in the Youth Violence 
Strike Force. Teen girls were involved in at least four incidents of armed violence during the second 
week of May.

particularly bloody summer. The new tracking program, referred inside the department as ''A Day in 
the Life," calls for monitoring the criminals who are believed to be largely responsible for the shocking 
increase in gun violence.

Boston Officials Launch Gun Buyback Program 
Boston Globe, May 30, 2006 
The Boston Globe indicated that City and police officials, and community leaders have recently 
announced that a gun buyback program is restarting in Boston. About $40,000 has been raised for the 
program, which details that people who turn in guns will be given $200 in Target gift cards. Gift cards 
will be used instead of cash because criminologists have found that in previous buyback programs, 
certain individuals used the buyback money to purchase newer guns.
