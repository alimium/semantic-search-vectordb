 
I want to thank Chairwoman McCarthy, Ranking Member Platts and members of the 
Sub-committee on Healthy Families and Communities for holding this hearing to explore 
the gang prevention activities on Long Island to learn what might be replicated across the 
country.   The reduction of gang recruitment efforts along with prevention of gang related 
crime is essential to the safety of all residents of our country.  The FBI Long Island 
Office reports that the Mara Salvatrucha, or MS-13, gang has been deemed to be a "High 
Threat" to the northeast section of our country due to its involvement in murder, assaults 
with weapons, firearms possession, drug distribution, extortion from businesses, 
prostitution and robbery. 
  
The immediate focus of the Freeport Police Departments efforts to mitigate gang 
recruitment was a Gang Awareness Suppression and Prevention Program (GASPP).  The 
demographics of the street gang population encompass a broad spectrum of race, 
ethnicity, gender and age and the program provides gang related information to parents, 
community members, school staffs, and the work force in an effort to reduce gang 
recruitment  
  
The awareness component of GASPP provides a description of various behaviors, and 
physical observations, which together or in some cases independently, are indicative of 
gang involvement.  While the information provided in the GASPP brochure (attachment 
# 1) is representative of gang indicators, it is not all-inclusive.  Symbols, colors, hand 
signs, clothing and gang codes consistently change due to Police awareness and fashion 
trends.  The changes in team logos and colors of professional sports organizations are 
frequently the impetus for such changes.   
 
The prevention element of GASPP encompasses many youth-oriented activities.  These 
include mentoring programs for elementary school students, along with a guide for 
parents that advises them of the many programs available to their child as an alternative 
to gangs.  Community members and businesses are requested to engage in positive 
interaction with adolescents to encourage appropriate social interaction.  Business 
owners, residents, and team coaches, are all requested to actively communicate with 
students who are engaging in inappropriate behavior.  This is done in a manner that is 
courteous and provides positive instruction as a means of conveying the necessity of civil 
behavior and to further individual achievement.   The School District Superintendent, 
together with high and middle school administrators, meet monthly with a Freeport 
Police Department command staff member to develop strategy to prevent gang activity in 
the schools and community based upon recent gang incidents.  Informal sharing occurs 
between the school staff and police in close time proximity to any gang involved offense 
when students are participants.  (Please see attachment #1 for detailed explanation of the 
GASPP program.) 
  
The suppression element of GASPP involves various law enforcement programs that are 
performed independently or in conjunction with community resources to discourage 
gang-related activity.  Suppression efforts include partnerships with federal and state 
prosecutors, along with a task force made up of federal, state and local law enforcement 
members.  Participation in the FBI Gang Task Force has provided additional law 
enforcement resources for conducting criminal investigations of gangs with a focus on 
their leadership.  These investigations have resulted in the arrest and successful 
prosecution of sixty-five members of Mara Salvatrucha, or MS-13. Other gangs that are 
prevalent through out Long Island such as the Latin King, Bloods, and Crips are being 
investigated for crimes similar to the type committed by MS-13, by both the FBI Gang 
Task Force and local law enforcement.   The Federal Court, without a prior conviction of 
a predicate felony, may not prosecute individual gang members, who are seventeen years 
of age or less.  Therefore gang members who have a defense based on their age are 
prosecuted locally.  The MS 13 members who were arrested were involved in the 
commission of various violent crimes that include dealing drugs, possession of firearms, 
rape, robbery and murder.   
  
Another cooperative gang suppression effort is a partnership with the Nassau County 
Probation Department that teams Police Officers with Probation Officers.  The Probation 
Department Officers lead the teams that visit the residences of probationers who are gang 
members.  These visits serve to ensure that the probationers are not in violation of any 
terms of their probation.  This compliance program also  verifies that gang members are 
not associating with other gang members or in possession of any firearms or drugs.  It 
also provides a means to establish that they are abiding by curfew restrictions, thereby 
discouraging their participation in crime.  
  
Supplementing traditional gang prevention techniques, the Freeport Police Department 
has developed and implemented a Home Visit Program (HVP).  The HVP has been 
designed to assist the parents of gang members by helping them recognize their child's 
association with a gang.  This usually takes place prior to an arrest of their son or 
daughter.  After a Police Officer has confirmed that an individual is involved with a gang 
and the information is passed on to the Commanding Officer of the Freeport Police 
Department’s Community Response Unit (CRU).  Two Detectives are assigned to 
conduct a home visit of the gang member's family to discuss their child's participation in 
the gang and advise them of the resources available to the family to help them discourage 
their child's further participation in the gang.   The initial reaction to the police visit is 
denial of their child’s involvement.  Only after the detectives present the parents with 
evidence that includes gang indicators such as tattoos, limited clothing attire restricted by 
color, letters or product initials, observation of hand signing, and their child or friends, 
are not hearing challenged, along with drawings, and gang paraphernalia in their school 
bags or books do, the parents realize that their child is involved with gangs.  In some 
instances, parents have relocated their son or daughter with relatives in other states or 
even other countries.  Other parents have expressed frustration and a lack of hope with 
regard to their child’s future.  A small percentage are currently gang members themselves 
or don’t see a problem with their child’s involved gang membership.   During testimony 
to the Nassau County Legislation Public Safety Committee, a Roosevelt, N.Y. 
Community Activist testified that the gang members in her neighborhood helped her 
grow up and she saw no problem with them hanging out with her children.  She further 
stated that the only gang she was afraid of was the gang dressed in blue that drive white 
cars with blue and orange stripes.  This was a reference to the Nassau County Police 
Department.  To make the HVP more effective, a partnership has been established with 
the Freeport Pride Youth Outreach organization, that has resulted in providing the parents 
with follow up referral services and involvement by their social workers. 
 
  
School Based Programs 
  
The Freeport Police Department Adopt-A-Cop Program is another activity that was 
developed to discourage youth from entering a gang.  The Adopt A Cop Program was 
formulated to provide a positive informal interaction between students and police 
officers.  The program requires the "adoption" of one police officer by each 4th grade 
class who will meet with their "adopted" Officer at the onset of the program and monthly 
thereafter throughout the school year. The officers who are involved in the Adopt A Cop 
program are volunteers.  Of the ninety-two Freeport police officers, twenty-eight 
volunteer as Adopt A Cops.   
 
During the monthly meeting, officers conduct an open exchange of ideas and discussions 
with their students that centers around the fore mentioned goals and objectives.  The 
officers also schedule tours of Police Headquarters and attend the school trips by their 
respective classes.  At the completion of each meeting, each student composes a letter to 
their police officer including any comments or questions which pertains to the prior 
meeting, or other police related concerns.  The officer responds with a general letter to 
the entire class, which is read to them by their teacher in between meetings.   
 
 
At the end of the school year, all of the fourth grade students, their adopted Police 
Officers and additional Police resources, celebrate the end of their school year together 
with Adopt A Cop Day.  The day is filled with interactive presentations that include tours 
of a Police helicopter, Horse Mounted Officer, SCUBA and K-9 demonstrations.  Pizza, 
hot dogs, soda and ice cream are enjoyed by all of the day's participants.  In addition each 
child is also given an Adopt a Cop tee shirt.     
  
  
Goals and Objectives: 
  
  
The goals and objectives of the Adopt A Cop program are to: 
  
A) Encourage the mutually beneficial exchange of information and concerns between the 
Adopted Cop and his/her class. 
  
B) Provide a positive police officer role model, thereby dispelling negative police 
stereotypes. 
  
C) Educate children about their safety, and discuss methods which the children may use 
to avoid potential hazardous situations, including gang recruitment efforts. 
  
D)       Discuss projects and non-violent forms of entertainment as a positive alternative 
to questionable media entertainment. 
  
E)        Provide an avenue for children to discuss positive alternate means to resolve 
conflict, or express anger or frustration as an alternative to violence or 
alcohol/drug use. 
  
F)        Provide insight into the function of police officers, and encourage students to 
consider law enforcement as a possible career. 
  
G) Contribute to the development of the children who participate in the Adopt A 
Cop program. 
 
Each of the officers who participate as Adopt-A-Cop Program volunteers receive the 
Freeport Police Department Community Service Award at the bi-annual award dinner. 
  
  
This program is currently in its eleventh year of operation.  
  
  
The Safe Schools Healthy Students grant had funded a similar but much smaller police 
mentoring program that was designed for middle school students, who were recognized 
to be considered "at risk" of gang involvement.  This program had been proposed by the 
Freeport Police Department to the Safe Schools Healthy Students Program Committee 
Members.  The committee included the Freeport School District, Nassau County BOCES, 
Operation Pride, Freeport Youth Outreach, and the South Shore Child Guidance Center.  
Middle school students were selected as the program participants due to a conscious 
belief by the program membership that this mentoring program would complement the 
Adopt-A-Cop program. Due to grant funding limitations, the program was limited with 
regard to the number of participants to achieve the greatest impact with limited resources.  
It was decided that middle school administrators and teachers would select those students 
they believed to be “at risk” of gang involvement for this program. 
 
 
 Ultimately the program would include this group of middle school students who the 
committee members believed would benefit the most from interaction with police 
officers.  The programs six police officers would interact weekly during a shared school 
based lunch meeting.  On weekends, students and police officers would jointly participate 
in sports, trips, and movie outings.  The officers received an hourly rate, which was 
substantially less than their police officer salaries as per diem school district employees.   
Unfortunately, in spite of its success, when the grant funding expired, the school district 
was unable to continue the program.      
  
  
Gang prevention efforts must also include educational programs that assist adolescents in 
achieving important developmental skills.  In 2004, the Freeport Police Department 
introduced an employment skills workshop designed to facilitate employment 
opportunities for middle school students.  The workshop provides these students with 
insight into the job application process, interview, preparation and employment 
expectations.  The information provided affords students the opportunity to be readily 
prepared to seek employment opportunities, thereby offering a counter balance to the 
limitations imposed by gang membership.  Gangs grant status to members who are 
violent, possess an active and lengthy criminal record and embrace a disregard of 
societies value on life, individual responsibility and achievement.   These traits are 
counterproductive to being successful in seeking employment.  The aforementioned gang 
tenets preclude a chance for a successful job interview in contrast to the Employment 
Skills Workshop.   (Please see attachment #2, Employment Skills Workshop).   
  
  
Community Partnership 
  
  
The aforementioned police initiatives were presented as initial efforts to address the 
proliferation of gangs and related crime issues.  Continuing in this vein in 2002, Mayor 
Glacken and the Board of Trustees with the Freeport Police Department, in conjunction 
with the Freeport school district, formed a consortium of various organizations and 
institutions that are associated with the Freeport community.  The organization was 
formed and named the Officials Working Group (OWG) for the purpose of preventing 
gang related crime through the concerted utilization of new and existing resources.  The 
main committee meets monthly, while the sub-committees meet during the month and 
report on their progress at the main monthly meeting. 
  
  
  
Representation on the committee rapidly expanded to include the Nassau County District 
Attorney's Office, Nassau County Youth Board, Freeport Parent Teachers Association 
(PTA), Hofstra University Liberty Partnership, Nassau County Coalition Against 
Domestic Violence, Junior Achievement, Nassau County Equal Opportunity 
Commission, Freeport Recreation Department, Freeport Pride, Education Tutorial 
Services, Struggling To Reunite Our New Generation (STRONG), along with 
representatives of various religious clergy and community advocates.  The School 
Superintendent chairs the committee. 
  
In the beginning, the committee decided to focus on reducing crime by addressing street 
gang violence and related anti-social behavior in the schools and community.  Committee 
members determined that the first objective would be to discourage gang recruitment 
efforts through community and parental awareness presentations.  A revised gang 
awareness program was developed from the pre-existing Freeport Police Department 
Gang Awareness, Suppression & Prevention (GASP) program.  The expanded Gang 
Awareness Program (GAP) is designed to inform community members, with an emphasis 
on parents of students, about how to determine if a person is involved in a gang through 
the identification of specific characteristics unique to street gang members.  In addition, 
the presentation list the reasons people join gangs, along with a description of their rites 
of initiation and explanation of the types of crimes they are associated with.   
 
The most powerful allure of a gang is the sense of power and respect that is perceived to 
come with membership; the power of numbers, control of a neighborhood, and fear of 
their potential for committing random acts of violence, that is mistaken for respect.  
These misplaced beliefs, in conjunction with a sense of being family or brothers or sisters 
against other gangs and those who they perceive as being different, creates a sense of 
unity.  In reality, the love, power, respect, and unity of gang membership is a path to 
arrest, imprisonment, injury, hospitalization, and death.   A community involvement 
component of GAP lists the various resources available to discourage gang recruitment 
efforts.  This includes involvement in alternative structural school activities, increased 
parental involvement in the education process, and access to professional counseling in 
schools via accredited private social outreach services. These prevention efforts, to be 
effective, must be in place to assist students as early as third grade.   
 
One OWG sub-committee has developed a bilingual “Guide to School and Community 
Activities for School Age Children.”  The guide provides parents with a broad variety of 
supervised and structured activities as an alternate to idle time.  The activities are listed 
according to a child’s age and grade. (Please see attachment #3 for the current guide). 
  
A member of the OWG who was partnered with an officer from the Freeport Police 
Department Community Response Unit (cru) gave each GAP presentation, and by 
February 2004, every school PTA in the Freeport School District had a GAP 
presentation..  Additional presentations are currently offered to any religious 
congregation or civic association willing to host the program.  Unfortunately, most of the 
presentations that have taken place were poorly attended.   
  
The expansion of Police Department school-based mentoring programs, interagency 
collaboration and interactive resident/police communications respective to street crime or 
related activity, supplement the many initiatives described above.  In conjunction with 
these efforts, the Police Department provides an assessment of the gang issues facing 
village residents along with insight into existing police-sponsored programs and 
enforcement operations.   Group dynamics of the OWG participants have afforded the 
members an opportunity to enhance existing programs.  As discussed prior, the Freeport 
Police Department "Home Visit Program" (HVP) has been changed to provide an 
additional resource.  Now when CRU officers visit the homes of known gang members to 
offer assistance to the gang member's parent(s), an additional service is provided.  
Freeport Pride, a private youth outreach program, is working with CRU officers to 
include their social workers in the HVP to offer their assistance and alternate program 
awareness to the gang members family. 
  
  
Another sub-committee is tasked with researching new programs for students as a 
deterrent to gang recruitment.  The committee members also arrange for former gang 
members or other motivational speakers to address student groups.  One sub-committee 
has the responsibility for researching new law proposals that are designed to deter gang 
related crime.  Other members are assigned to pursue the development of new initiatives 
and partnerships with like organizations outside Freeport.  These include the; Hispanic 
Counseling Center, Family and Children Associations, Nassau County Youth Board, 
Nassau County Department of Social Services, and the Salvation Army. 
  
  
One of the new initiatives that have been implemented is a student survey. The survey 
was conducted in anticipation that the results would assist the committee with identifying 
areas of need that the committee would focus on to better assist students with meeting 
today's challenges.  The framework of the Search Institute survey evaluates a student’s 
sense of possessing skills or “Developmental Assets” in the following five categories. 
 
1) On going relationships with caring adults. 
2) Safe places and structured activities during non-school hours. 
3) A healthy start for a healthy future. 
4) Marketable skills through effective education. 
5) Opportunities to serve. 
 
 
Currently the OWG is evaluating the results of a Developmental Asset Survey that was 
given to even grade students from 4th to 12th grades.  The Search Institute vision is to 
"Have a world where all young people are valued and thrive".  (Please see attachment #4 
for a descriptive booklet on the survey)   
 
While Freeport School students offered responses that are comparable to national average 
results, the specific asset deficiencies were disheartening.  This is especially true with 
regard to the following; 
1)      Positive family communications-only 16% locally and 28% nationally have this 
asset 
2)      Have high expectations for themselves-56% locally and 48% nationally have this 
asset 
3)      A sense of bonding to the school-38% locally and 52% nationally have this asset 
4)      The ability to initiate peaceful conflict resolution-21% locally and 40% nationally 
5)      A sense of feeling safe-42% locally and 51% nationally 
6)      Have and understand family boundaries-36% locally and 46% nationally 
7)      Experience positive peer influence-54% locally and 63% nationally 
8) Use time at home constructively-43% locally and 51% nationally 
9)      Feel capable of exercising restraint-30% locally and 45% nationally 
  
The above survey results, while not specific enticements to gang involvement, help 
explain the allure of a gang as a surrogate family.  The unity, love and respect that is 
perceived to be, or is missing in the family, creates a void that gang membership purports 
to fill.  
  
 Family values once taken for granted as the foundation for child development have been 
seriously eroded.   Inappropriate societal influences including entertainment media, video 
games, and magazines, such as "Don Diva", glorify violence and misogynistic views.  
These sources, combined with a news media, that sensationalizes horrific acts of 
violence, become difficult influences for parents and schools to overcome.  In addition, a 
confused sense as to what constitutes traditional cultural values contributes to minimizing 
the reservations a person may have with regard to joining a gang.  
  
Multi-culturalism without support for the established cultural values & beliefs contributes 
to national confusion on how to address many of the problems facing society.  A "melting 
pot" without a common language will become a "Tower of Babble".  The ability to 
engage in effective communication is an essential element of any successful gang 
eradication effort.  Confused or misunderstood communications frequently result in 
unattended and sometimes deadly consequences.  I have witnessed native-born gang 
members openly discuss their distrust of non-English speaking members of opposing 
gangs during school gang prevention workshops. 
  
The allure of gang membership in some cases originates from a family member.  In many 
cases either the father or sibling is the pathway to gang membership.  The family legacy 
road to gang membership is more common within Hispanic gangs, where two or more 
generations who belong to the same gang may live together.   Even families without a 
gang member within it are experiencing difficulty with raising their children due to the 
outside influences.   
  
In a recent disturbing trend, the Freeport Police Department has experienced an increase 
in domestic incident calls that involve parents who state that they are overwhelmed and 
feels incapable of dealing with the behavioral issues of their child.  Most of these parents 
are looking for help and guidance.  Others have stated that they don't care about their 
child and want the Police to take them and place them in jail or any place, just away from 
them.  These children have been abandoned in place and will be at risk absent meaningful 
intervention by reinvigorated and accomplished government services.   
  
The effectiveness of the programs described herein is difficult to weigh.  In spite of the 
efforts expended, gangs proliferate in surrounding communities, while their membership 
numbers remain relatively constant within Freeport.  The gang recruiting that has been 
thwarted is due to the collective labors of the Freeport Police Department and its many 
partners.  The total magnitude of the gang activity that has been prevented is an 
intangible.  The obvious and consensus view is that more needs to be done on the federal, 
state and local levels.   
  
The most important next step is changing the culture to restore values that incorporate 
and encourage a sense of unity, respect, and devotion to guarantee the rights of others to 
be free from threats, intimidation or harm.  Free speech issues must be weighed in the 
context of offense it was intended to cause.  Restrictions on profanity do not restrict a 
person’s ability to communicate.  Conversely, our ability to communicate would be 
enhanced by the expansion of vocabulary for the purpose of engaging in persuasive 
communication without vulgarity.  
 
The family must plant courtesy and the skills of positive social interaction during infancy.  
Overwhelmingly, television has become the primary babysitter of youth.  The social 
skills developed through this medium bare little resemblance to “Sesame Street” and are 
more representative of the “Jerry Springer Show.”  Parenting skill programs and related 
educational programs must find a way into our early child development efforts.  The 
subsequent benefit to focusing on early development skills and communication programs 
will achieve benefits in reducing domestic violence, providing academic, and skills 
learning, all of which are measurable outcomes. They also support a cohesive family unit 
as the primary deterrent to gang involvement.  Furthermore we must work to ensure that 
all people are embraced and afforded opportunity as true equals.  This is a daunting task 
that must be implemented as soon as possible.   Anything less than the timely 
implementation of these principles will guarantee that our gang prevention efforts will be 
as successful as the current "war on drugs".
