Dear Dockets
Management
Branch (HFA-305),
Fo~cl~n
g Kdminl:tr’ation,
I am writing
in regards to the regulations
requiring
irradiated
food to be labeled as such.
As a
health conscious
and environmentally
concerned
consumer,
I have no desire to purchase
or support
irradiation,
let alone @ irradiated
food.
We (consumers)
have the right to know what has been done to our
food! ! ~.
Thus I support prominent
labeling
of irradiated
foods,
I believe
the FDA should require that all
food, packaged
or fresh, that has been irradiated
include both the logo for irradiation
and a statement
like,
“Treated
by irradiation.”
These labels should not be hidden in the list of ingredients
but prominently
displayed.
Please help keep the choice in the consumer’s
hand!
Thank you,
.
