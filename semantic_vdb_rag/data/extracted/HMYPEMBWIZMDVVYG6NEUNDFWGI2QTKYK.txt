PART IV:  FAMILY ASSESSMENT AND INVESTIGATION 
 
The Virginia Administrative Code 22VAC40-705-10 defines family assessment and 
investigation as follows: 
 
 
“Family assessment” means the collection of information necessary to 
determine: 
a. The immediate safety needs of the child; 
b. The protective and rehabilitative services needs of the child and family 
that will deter abuse or neglect; 
c. Risk of future harm to the child; and 
d. Alternative plans for the child’s safety if protective and rehabilitative 
services are indicated and the family is unable or unwilling to participate in 
services. These arrangements may be made in consultation with the 
caretaker(s) of the child. 
 
"Investigation" means the collection of information to determine: 
1. The immediate safety needs of the child; 
2. The protective and rehabilitative services needs of the child and family 
that will deter abuse or neglect; 
3. Risk of future harm to the child; 
4. Alternative plans for the child’s safety if protective and rehabilitative 
services are indicated and the family is unable or unwilling to 
participate in services; 
5. Whether or not abuse or neglect has occurred; 
6. If abuse or neglect has occurred, who abused or neglected the child; 
and 
7. A finding of either founded or unfounded based on the facts collected 
during the investigation. 
 
Every valid report of abuse or neglect must receive either a family assessment or an 
investigation.  The goals of both responses are to: 
• Assess child safety 
• Strengthen and support families 
• Prevent child maltreatment 
 
The following charts show the CPS Process and Requirements for Family Assessment 
and Investigation.

A. 
Authorities 
 
The Code of Virginia grants CPS workers the authority to conduct family assessments 
and investigations in response to a valid report of suspected child abuse or neglect.  
Generally, the power to enforce the worker's authority lies with the courts.  For example, 
if an individual refuses to allow the worker to conduct the family assessment or refuses 
to talk to the worker, the worker may file a petition requesting that the court require the 
individual to cooperate.   An individual's refusal to cooperate does not relieve the local 
department of the responsibility to complete the family assessment or investigation 
because it has been initiated due to a valid report of abuse or neglect.  These au-
thorities are applicable only during the conduct of the family assessment or investigation 
 
1.0 
Authority to Interview the Child 
 
22VAC40-705-60(1). [When responding to valid complaints or reports 
local departments have the following authority] To talk to any child 
suspected of being abused and/or neglected, or child's siblings, 
without the consent of and outside the presence of the parent or 
other caretaker, as set forth by § 63.2-1518 of the Code of Virginia. 
 
If the CPS worker talks to the child without the parent’s or guardian’s prior knowledge, 
the CPS worker must notify the parent or guardian concerning the interview as soon as 
possible.     
 
1.1 
Parent or Guardian Refuses to Allow Child to be Interviewed 
 
The worker may consult with local county/city attorney to determine 
whether to petition the court to request access to the child if denied 
access.   
 
1.2 
CPS Worker May Exclude School Personnel From Interview 
 
If the CPS worker interviews the child at school, the worker may exclude 
school personnel from the interview in order to protect the family's right to 
privacy. 
 
2.0 
Authority to Take or Arrange for X-Rays and Photographs of the Alleged 
Victim Child 
 
22VAC40-705-60(2). [When responding to valid complaints or reports 
local departments have the following authority] To take or arrange 
for photographs and x-rays of a child who is the subject of a

complaint without the consent of and outside the presence of the 
parent or other caretaker, as set forth in § 63.2-1520 of the Code of 
Virginia. 
 
Photographs may be taken as part of an investigation or family assessment to 
document the nature and extent of injuries to the child.  These photographs cannot be 
used in lieu of a medical examination. 
 
 
X-rays of a child may be taken without the consent of the parent or guardian as part of a 
medical evaluation related to a CPS family assessment or investigation.  All 
photographs or x-rays taken in accordance with the Code of Virginia § 63.2-1520 may 
be introduced into evidence in any subsequent court hearing.  The court can impose 
any restrictions concerning the confidentiality of the photographs or x-rays.  
 
2.1 
Local Department May Seek Complete Medical Examination of  the 
Child   
  
22VAC40-705-60(3)(d).  The local department shall have the 
authority to have a complete medical examination made of the 
child including a written medical report and, when appropriate, 
photographs and x-rays pursuant to  §63.2-1520 of the Code 
of Virginia. 
 
 
The Code of Virginia § 63.2-1524 grants authority to the court to order 
psychological, psychiatric and physical examinations of the child alleged to be 
abused or neglected or of the child’s parents, guardians, caretakers or siblings.  
If the alleged victim child’s parent, caretaker or other legal guardian refuses 
permission to have a complete medical examination of the child, the local 
department may consult with the county/city attorney to determine whether to 
seek a court ordered examination of the child.   
 
 
2.2 
Photographs of the Child’s Environment 
 
The CPS worker must obtain verbal or written consent from the parent or 
guardian of the child prior to taking any photographs of the child's environment.  
Without the consent of parents or guardians, any photographs should only be 
taken under the direction and supervision of the Commonwealth's Attorney, or 
the city or county attorney for the local department. 
 
Photographs may be taken to clarify statements made by witnesses, to 
document the circumstances surrounding the alleged abuse or neglect, to

Authority to Remove a Child 
 
The Code of Virginia § 63.2-1517 provides that a child may be taken into 
emergency custody when the circumstances present an imminent danger to the 
child's life or health to the extent that severe or irremediable injury would likely 
result before a hearing could be held and a court order was not immediately 
obtainable.  The Code of Virginia § 63.2-1517 also allows a physician, a child 
protective services workers or a law-enforcement officer to assume custody of a 
child when the evidence of the abuse is perishable or subject to deterioration 
before a court hearing can be held.2 
 
22VAC40-705-60(3).  [When responding to valid complaints or reports 
local departments have the following authorities:]  To take a child 
into custody on an emergency removal for up to 72-96 hours under 
such circumstances as set forth in § 63.2-1517 of the Code of 
Virginia. 
 
3.1 
Persons Who May Take a Child Into Custody 
 
The following persons may take a child into custody for 72-96 hours 
without prior approval of the child's parents or guardian:

c. 
A law enforcement officer when he is investigating a complaint of 
child abuse or neglect.

2 Prior to the 1998 General Assembly,  § 63.2-1517 of the Virginia Code specified certain circumstances that must 
exist for a child to be taken into custody by a physician, a child protective services worker or law-enforcement 
officer. The 1998 General Assembly amended § 63.2-1517 of the Virginia Code by incorporating language allowing 
a physician, a child protective services workers or a law-enforcement officer to assume custody of a child when the 
evidence of the abuse is perishable or subject to deterioration before a court hearing can be held.

3.5 
Placement Requirements When CPS Has Assumed Emergency 
 
Custody of the Child 
 
The local department must ensure that the child is placed in an appropriate 
emergency, temporary, or permanent setting which will assure the child's safety.  
If the child is placed in an agency approved placement, the CPS worker should 
consult with the agency’s foster care or foster home staff.   
 
 
The following procedures must be followed prior to placing the child.   
 
 
 
a. 
Supervisory Consultation to Determine Placement 
 
 
 
The child’s safety is the primary consideration in deciding 
whether to place the child on an emergency basis with a 
relative, neighbor or friend. The CPS worker in consultation 
with a supervisor makes a decision to place the child in the 
home of a relative, neighbor or friend that is not an agency 
approved provider.  The decision is based on the child’s best 
interest and the appropriate local agency procedures are 
followed to make the placement.   
 
 
 
b.. 
Required Background Checks on Individuals with   
 
 
 
Whom an Agency May Place a Child on an   
 
 
 
 
Emergency Basis  
  
 
If the CPS worker is considering a placement with a person 
that is not an agency approved provider, the Code of Virginia 
§ 63.2-901.1B requires CPS central registry checks and a 
written statement of affirmation disclosing any child abuse 
and neglect and criminal history in Virginia and any other

PART IV:  FAMILY ASSESSMENT AND INVESTIGATION 
 
state of residence in the past five years for each adult in the 
home. The CPS worker, in consultation with a supervisor, 
shall evaluate and document in the automated data system 
the results of the CPS central registry searches on every 
adult household member with whom the agency is 
considering placing the child.  The Sworn Statement of 
Affirmation form is available at:  
 http://spark.dss.virginia.gov/divisions/dfs/forms.cgi 
 
 
 
 
It is the CPS  worker’s responsibility to complete both the central 
registry search and state police criminal background check as soon 
as possible.   
 
For further guidance on emergency placements refer to the Virginia 
Department of Social Services Foster Care Manual, Volume VII, 
Section III, Chapter B, Section 4 at:  
http://spark.dss.virginia.gov/divisions/dfs/fc/procedures.cgi  
 
The worker and supervisor may also refer to the Virginia 
Department of Social Services Local Department Resource, Foster 
and Adoptive Family Home Approval Guidance Manual.   
 
 
 
c. 
Post Emergency Placement Procedures   
 
 
 
The Code of Virginia § 63.2-901.1 establishes additional searches 
or procedures are required if the child is to remain in the 
emergency non agency approved placement for more than three 
days.  CPS workers should consult with agency foster care or foster 
home staff to ensure these requirements are met if the child is to 
remain in the emergency placement for longer than three days.  
The worker may refer to 
http://spark.dss.virginia.gov/divisions/obi/background for additional 
information regarding criminal background checks. 
 
d. 
Convene Family Partnership Meeting Around Emergency 
Removal 
 
The local department should schedule a family partnership 
meeting when the worker assesses the child’s safety to be in 
jeopardy or at risk of removal or out of home placement. 
However, safety concerns are paramount and necessary 
action to address safety issues shall not be delayed. The

Child Protective Services 
Volume VII, Section III, Chapter A 
 
PART IV:  FAMILY ASSESSMENT AND INVESTIGATION 
 
family partnership meeting should be scheduled within 24 
hours after safety issues have been identified and the agency 
is considering removal, and occur before the 5 day court 
hearing in cases after the emergency removal. Emergency 
removal prompts the need to convene a family partnership 
meeting.  This meeting provides the opportunity for family and 
community participation in the decision-making process for the 
child. The purpose of the meeting is to facilitate planning to 
determine whether: 
1.  The agency should file for custody and facilitate 
placement; 
2.  The child can remain home safely with services, or the 
child return safely home with services; or 
3.  There will be voluntary placement of the child by parents with 
provision of services and a safety plan. 
 
The CPS worker should conduct the face to face interview with 
the alleged victim child and the parent/caretaker prior to the family 
partnership meeting since the purpose of the meeting is not to 
interview caretakers, alleged victims, or other collaterals.   
 
The worker and supervisor should discuss the convening and timing of a 
family partnership meeting at this critical decision point.  All family 
partnership meetings must be documented in the automated data 
system.  For guidance on family partnership meetings please refer to:  
http://spark.dss.virginia.gov/divisions/dfs/family_engagement 
http://www.dss.virginia.gov/family/fe.cgi#manual  
 
e. 
Notification to Relatives  
 
Within 30 days after removing a child from the custody of the 
parent/guardian(s), the local department of social services shall provide 
written notice to all grandparents and other adult relatives that the child is 
being removed or has been removed from the custody of the 
parent/guardian(s).  The purpose of this notice is to explain options the 
relative has to participate in the care and placement of the child in an 
effort to establish permanency for the child.  The local department may 
determine it is not in the child’s best interest to notify relatives involved in 
family or domestic violence or who are listed on the Virginia State Police 
Sex Offender Registry.  A copy of the written communication shall be kept 
in the record, and a notation of the agency send date and relative 
response date, if any, must be recorded in the automated data system. 
For additional guidance on notification of relatives refer to the Virginia

3.6 
Authority to Obtain Immediate Medical or Surgical Treatment for 
 
Child 
 
The Virginia Administrative Code explains the Code of Virginia § 54.1-
2969 granting this authority.   
 
22VAC40-705-60(3)(e).  When a child in 72-96 hour custody is 
in need of immediate medical or surgical treatment, the local 
director of social services or his designee(s) may consent to 
such treatment when the parent does not provide consent and 
a court order is not immediately obtainable. 
 
When a local department has assumed custody of a child and that child is in 
need of immediate medical or surgical treatment, the local department must take 
the following actions as listed below:  
 
a. 
If a child is in need of immediate medical treatment and the 
parent is unwilling or unable to consent, the local department 
should first attempt to obtain a court order for treatment.   
 
b. 
If a court order is not immediately obtainable, authority to 
consent to surgical or medical treatment, tantamount with 
that of a parent, is confirmed upon the local director of the 
local department, or that person’s designee.  
 
3.6.1 Local Director May Designate Certain Persons to Provide  
 
Consent 
 
The local director may designate no more than two persons 
to act on his or her behalf in authorizing surgical or medical 
treatment.  Those persons must be chosen from:   
 
(1) 
Assistant director; 
(2) 
Casework supervisor; 
(3) 
Senior social worker; or 
(4) 
Social worker.

PART IV:  FAMILY ASSESSMENT AND INVESTIGATION 
 
3.6.2 Parents or Guardians of Child Must be Notified as Soon  as 
 
Practicable 
 
Any authorized person who consents to emergency surgical or 
medical treatment of a child must make every reasonable effort to 
notify the child's parent or guardian as soon as practicable.   
 
3.6.3 Establish Protocol With Local Hospitals for Obtaining Consent 
 
Each local department should establish protocol with local hospitals 
for obtaining consent when surgical and medical treatment is 
necessary for a child under emergency custody.  This agreement 
should include:   
 
a. 
A list of persons who may sign the consent form;   
 
b. 
A statement that the parents or guardians of the child 
refuse to give consent or are unavailable to give 
consent;   
 
c. 
A statement that a court order for such treatment is 
not immediately obtainable;   
 
d. 
A statement from the attending physician as to what 
treatment is necessary.   
 
3.6.4 Payment for Surgical and Medical Treatment  
 
The local department should attempt to obtain payment for surgical 
or medical treatment from the child’s parents, or the child’s legal 
guardians if appropriate.  If the parents or legal guardians are 
unable to pay for the treatment, the local department shall explore 
the possibility that the child may be eligible for Medicaid, Medicare 
or other funding. 
 
3.6.5 Local Department Cannot Provide Consent if Child is Not in 
 
Custody 
 
22VAC40-705-60(3)(f).  When a child is not in the local 
department's custody, the local department cannot 
consent to medical or surgical treatment of the child.

Related Responsibilities To Conduct Family Assessment and Investigation 
 
1.0 
CPS Worker May Enter the Home 
 
22VAC40-705-90(A).  In conducting a family assessment or an 
investigation, the child protective services (CPS) worker may enter 
the home if permitted to enter by an adult person who resides in the 
home. Only in those instances where the CPS worker has probable 
cause to believe that the life or health of the child would be seriously 
endangered within the time it would take to obtain a court order or 
the assistance of a law enforcement officer, may a CPS worker enter 
the home without permission.  A child protective services worker 
shall document in detail in the record and discuss with supervisory 
personnel the basis for the decision to enter the house without 
permission. 
 
1.1 
Entering the Home 
 
When conducting a family assessment or an investigation, the CPS 
worker should explain the purpose of the visit and enter the home when 
allowed to do so by an adult who resides in the home.   
 
1.2 
CPS Worker May Enter Home Without Permission if There is 
Probable Cause to Believe Exigent Circumstances Exist 
 
The worker cannot enter the home without permission unless there is 
probable cause to believe that the circumstances are such that the life or 
health of the child would be seriously endangered within the time it would 
take to obtain a court order or the assistance of a police officer.   
 
The assistance of a police officer does not, in and of itself, provide the 
authority for a social worker to enter the home without permission.  There 
must be probable cause to believe that “exigent circumstances” exist.   
 
“Probable cause” means the reasonable belief in the existence of facts on 
which the complaint is based.3  “Exigent circumstances” means situations 
that demand unusual or immediate action.  They are emergency-like 
circumstances in which the social worker must act immediately to protect 
the safety of a child or preserve the evidence in an investigation. 4

1.3 
CPS Worker Must Consult with Supervisor and Document Decision 
to Enter a Home Without Permission 
 
If the circumstances are such that the CPS worker must enter the home 
without permission of an adult residing in the home, the CPS worker must 
record in the automated data system the reason for this action.  The CPS 
worker must consult with a supervisor to make this decision. 
 
1.4 
Adult Residing in Home Refuses to Allow CPS Worker to Enter a 
 
Home  
 
If a person residing in the home refuses to allow the CPS worker into the 
home and there are no exigent circumstances demanding that the CPS 
worker act immediately, the CPS worker must consider alternate plans 
such as seeking court assistance to gain access to the home.  The CPS 
worker may consult with county/city attorney to determine if court 
intervention is appropriate.  For a further discussion of alternatives to 
entering the home when permission is denied, see Appendix.  
 
 
1.4.1 Exception: Conducting Joint Investigation with  
 
 
 
 
Law-Enforcement  
 
If, during a joint investigation, a law-enforcement officer or the 
Commonwealth’s Attorney Office objects to the CPS worker 
informing the person of his right to refuse entry, the local 
department should consider that objection as an exception to 
22VAC40-705-90(A).   
 
The objection is only valid during a joint investigation with law-
enforcement when the investigation involves criminal charges.  The 
objection must be premised upon not compromising the criminal 
investigation.  The CPS worker must document the objection in the 
automated data system.  
 
2.0 
Transport Children 
 
22VAC40-705-90(C).  The child protective services worker may 
transport a child without parental consent only when the local 
department has assumed custody of that child by virtue of 72-96 
hour removal authority pursuant to § 63.2-1517 of the Code of 
Virginia, by an emergency removal court order pursuant to § 16.1-251

3.0   CPS Worker May Request Alleged Abuser or Neglector to Consent To 
Substance Abuse Screening 
 
22VAC40-705-90(D).  When a child protective services worker has 
reason to believe that the caretaker in a valid report of child abuse or 
neglect is abusing substances and such behavior may be related to 
the matter being investigated or assessed, the worker may request 
that person to consent to substance abuse screening or may petition 
the court to order such screening. 
 
3.1 
Local Departments Must Develop Substance Abuse Guidelines 
 
22VAC40-705-90(D)(1).  Local departments must develop 
guidelines for such screening. 
 
22VAC40-705-90(D)(2).  Guidelines may include child 
protective services worker administration of urine screening. 
 
The local department should seek the assistance of the Commonwealth’s 
Attorney Office, the local city or county attorney, or the court to develop these 
guidelines. 
 
4.0 
Reasonable Diligence 
 
The Code of Virginia § 63.2-1503(F) mandates local departments to use reasonable 
diligence in locating the subjects of a report or complaint of abuse or neglect.  
 
22 VAC 40-705-50(H)(3).  The local department shall use reasonable 
diligence to locate any child for whom a report or complaint of 
suspected child abuse and/or neglect has been received and 
determined valid or persons who are the subject of a valid report if 
the whereabouts of such persons are unknown to the local 
department, pursuant to § 63.2-1503(F) of the Code of Virginia.

5.0     Identifying Relatives and Family Supports 
 
During the course of the investigation or family assessment, the worker 
should gather information to identify maternal and paternal relatives and 
the kinship network providing support and resources to the family and 
child.  Many families identify non-relatives as kin, such as godparents, 
friends and others with whom they have a family-like relationship.  The 
early identification of adult family members and supports is critical for 
initial assessments when identifying protective factors, strengths, and 
needs.   When appropriate, these individuals may become resources in 
protective interventions, family partnership meetings, and case planning 
during the CPS process or any future case involvement.  For Resources 
and Tools for Diligent Family Search and Engagement link to:

Notify Family of Family Assessment or Investigation 
 
The Virginia Administration Code 22VAC40-705-90(B) requires the CPS worker to 
explain the CPS Family Assessment or Investigation process to the alleged abuser or 
neglector.   
 
22VAC40-705-90(B). Before conducting a family assessment or 
investigation, the child protective services worker shall explain the 
responsibilities and authorities of CPS so that the parent or other caretaker 
can be made aware of the possible benefits and consequences of 
completing the family assessment or investigation.  The explanation must 
be provided orally and in writing. 
 
The CPS worker must notify the family in writing and orally that a report of suspected 
abuse or neglect has been received and that a family assessment or an investigation 
will be conducted in response to the report.  The written notification is one of the 
following brochures: 
 
“Child Protective Services:  A Guide to Family Assessment”  
“Child Protective Services:  A Guide to Investigative Procedures” 
 
1.0 
Notify Non-Custodial Parent 
 
Pursuant to § 63.2-1503(O) of the Code of Virginia, the local department shall make 
reasonable efforts to notify the non-custodial parent when that parent is not the subject 
of the child abuse or neglect report.  Not only does the non-custodial parent have a right 
to know about the report involving his/her child, that parent may be a resource to the 
child and should be invited to any family partnership meeting scheduled. However, if 
there is reason to believe that such notification would be detrimental to the child, the 
local department may take that concern into account.  The response to the report 
should not be delayed if the non-custodial parent is unreasonably difficult to contact.  
The local department should document all reasonable efforts to locate and notify the 
non-custodial parent about the report. Conversely, the local department should 
document why reasonable efforts were not made to notify the non-custodial parent.

harm, and where appropriate shall make a safety plan to provide for 
the protection of the child. 
 
An initial safety assessment is conducted at the beginning of a family assessment or 
investigation.  The purpose of the initial safety assessment and safety plan is to: 
• Assess whether any children are currently in immediate danger of serious 
physical harm that may require a protecting intervention; and 
• To determine what interventions should be maintained or initiated to provide 
appropriate protection.   
 
Safety Assessments differ from Risk Assessments in that the purpose is to assess a 
child’s present or immediate danger and the interventions currently needed to protect 
the child.  In contrast, Risk Assessment evaluates the likelihood of future maltreatment. 
 
1.0  
Immediate Child Safety and Family Needs 
 
Safety must be determined for each child and the safety conclusion based on the least 
safe child if there is more than one child in the family.  To ensure that the safety of the 
child is appropriately assessed in each family assessment and investigation, the local 
department must complete an initial safety assessment at the first meaningful contact 
with the family and document the results in the automated data system. 
 
The safety assessment provides structured questions concerning the danger of 
immediate harm or maltreatment to a child.  This information guides the decision about 
whether the child may remain in the home with no intervention, may remain in the home 
with safety interventions in place, or must be removed from the home.  This is an 
appropriate time for the local department to consider convening a family partnership 
meeting if necessary to address ongoing safety planning. 
 
There is a Safety Assessment Checklist in the Appendix that can be used to evaluate 
safety factors as well as protective factors that are to be considered along with the 
elements that underlie child safety, including THREAT, HARM, SEVERITY, 
VULNERABILITY, AND IMMINENCE.  These elements provide a context for the safety 
factors.  
For example, a 3 year old child may be more vulnerable and more threatened with 
severe harm by an out of control parent than a 13 year old, but even the 3 year old may 
be deemed safe if the parent has just been taken away by the police and a responsible 
adult is available – so there is no severe nor imminent threat of harm to the vulnerable 
child.

PART IV:  FAMILY ASSESSMENT AND INVESTIGATION 
 
 
 
1.1   Assess Immediate Danger to the Child 
 
The initial safety assessment focuses on the child and the child’s immediate 
needs.  Factors to consider when assessing the immediate situation of the child 
include: 
 
a. 
Whether the child has sustained a mental or physical injury 
warranting immediate attention or care;  
 
b.       Whether an emergency or crisis situation exists meriting  
 
 
immediate action to protect the child; 
 
  
c. 
Whether the child is at risk of serious abuse or neglect  
 
 
in the near future. 
 
1.2  
Assess Immediate Needs of the Family  
 
After assessing the immediate safety needs of the child, the worker must 
evaluate the immediate needs of the family.  Factors to consider include: 
 
a. 
If the child has been injured or harmed, whether the family 
has the capabilities or capacity to protect the child from 
further harm; 
 
b. 
Whether an emergency or crisis situation exists and the 
family’s ability to cope; 
 
c. 
Whether any other family members are at risk of harm or 
danger; 
 
d.       What are the family’s capabilities to ensure the safety of the 
 
child or children in the near future. 
 
1.3 
Domestic Violence and Substance Abuse as Safety and/or Risk 
 
Assessment Issues 
 
Two family issues that can have a major impact on safety and risk are 
domestic violence and drug and/or alcohol involvement by the child’s 
caretakers.

Volume VII, Section III, Chapter A 
 
PART IV:  FAMILY ASSESSMENT AND INVESTIGATION 
 
Local departments are required to develop guidelines for evaluating 
substance or drug abuse.  The CAGEAID tool is one tool that provides 
questions that can be worked into the interviews with the primary 
caretakers, and a “yes” to any question may indicate a need for an AOD 
(alcohol or other drug) evaluation in order to complete the risk 
assessment.  A copy of this tool is in the Appendix. 
 
The Domestic Violence INITIAL ASSESSMENT tool could be given to the 
caretaker to complete or the questions may be asked by the CPS worker.  
A “yes” answer to these questions may mean the CPS worker should 
make a referral to a community domestic violence service provider for a 
more complete assessment of need.  A copy of this tool is in the 
Appendix. 
 
2.0 
Make Safety Decision 
 
After safety and protective factors have been assessed, the CPS worker must 
make a decision about the safety of the child(ren) in the home.  The safety 
decision should be made on the basis of the needs of the least safe child in the 
home, if there is more than one child.  One of the following safety decisions must 
be determined and documented in the automated data system and shared with 
the family.   
 
A. SAFE: There are no children likely to be in immediate danger of moderate to 
serious harm at this time.  No safety plan is required. 
 
B. CONDITIONALLY SAFE: Safety interventions are in place and have resolved 
the unsafe situation for the present time.  A safety plan is required to document 
the interventions.   
 
C. UNSAFE:  Without controlling intervention(s) a child is in immediate danger of 
serious harm.  A court order or safety plan is required to document intervention.   
 
2.1 
Safety Decision and Family Partnership Meeting 
 
 
The local department should schedule a family partnership meeting when 
the worker assesses the child’s safety to be in jeopardy or at risk of 
removal or out of home placement. However, safety concerns are 
paramount and necessary action to address safety issues shall not be 
delayed. The family partnership meeting should be scheduled within 24 
hours after safety issues have been identified and the agency is 
considering removal, and occur before the 5 day court hearing in cases 
after the emergency removal. Emergency removal prompts the need to

Volume VII, Section III, Chapter A 
 
PART IV:  FAMILY ASSESSMENT AND INVESTIGATION 
 
convene a family partnership meeting.  This meeting provides the 
opportunity for family and community participation in the decision-making 
process for the child. The purpose of the meeting is to facilitate planning to 
determine whether: 
1.  The agency should file for custody and facilitate placement; 
2.  The child can remain home safely with services, or the child may 
return safely home with services; or 
3.  There will be voluntary placement of the child by parents with 
provision of services and a safety plan. 
 
The CPS worker should conduct the face to face interview with the alleged 
victim child and the parent/caretaker prior to the family partnership 
meeting since the purpose of the meeting is not to interview caretakers, 
victims, or other collaterals.   
 
The worker and supervisor should discuss the convening and timing of a family 
engagement meeting at this critical decision point.  All family partnership 
meetings must be documented in the automated data system.  For guidance on 
family partnership meetings please refer to:   
http://spark.dss.virginia.gov/divisions/dfs/family_engagement 
http://www.dss.virginia.gov/family/fe.cgi#manual  
 
 
3.0 
Develop Safety Plan  
 
When the child is determined to be Conditionally Safe or Unsafe, the CPS worker must 
determine what services or actions need to occur by developing a safety plan.  The 
Virginia Administrative Code 22VAC40-705-10 defines safety plan: 
 
"Safety plan" means an immediate course of action designed to 
protect a child from abuse or neglect. 
 
A safety plan must be made to ensure the immediate protection of the child.  When 
possible, the worker needs to develop the safety plan with the cooperation of the child's 
parent(s) or guardian(s).  The CPS worker must determine what actions are necessary 
to assure the child's immediate safety.  If the actions needed to assure the safety of the 
child cannot be put in place, alternative steps must be taken that can include court 
intervention.  The safety plan and the CPS worker’s efforts to develop the safety plan 
with the family must be documented in the record.  A copy of the safety plan shall be left 
with the caretaker of the child and/or the alleged abuser.  A Safety Plan format is 
located in the Appendix.    
 
Whenever possible the caretaker(s) should sign the safety plan along with the worker, 
so that this document can be used as an agreement as to who will do what to prevent

harm to the children in the immediate future.  Other parties to the agreement, such as 
service providers, may also sign the form. 
 
4.0 
Reassessing Safety 
 
Safety assessment is both a process and a document. The process of assessing child 
safety is ongoing throughout the life of the CPS referral and ongoing case as 
information is gathered with each contact.  While the initial safety decision and safety 
plan are documented in the automated data system, any subsequent changes in safety 
assessed in referrals or ongoing cases in the following circumstances should be 
documented in the automated data system as well: 
a.) 
A change in family circumstances such that one or more safety factors 
previously present are no longer present; 
b.) 
A change in information known about the family in that one or more safety 
factors not present before are present now; or 
c.)  
A change in ability of safety interventions to mitigate safety factors and 
require changes to the safety plan. 
 
When safety is reassessed, the safety plan should be reviewed and revised 
accordingly.  A family partnership meeting may be considered if safety concerns 
escalate. 
    
F. 
Conduct Family Assessment 
 
 
 
22VAC40-705-70(B). When completing a family assessment, the  
 
 
 
local department shall gather all relevant information in collaboration  
 
 
with the family, to the degree possible, in order to determine the  
 
 
 
child and family services needs related to current safety or future  
 
 
 
risk of harm to the child. 
 
The family assessment is a process of gathering and evaluating information and 
formulating conclusions regarding family functioning specific to child 
abuse/neglect, the presenting complaint allegations, and family needs related to 
child safety and risk of future abuse or neglect. 
 
The family assessment is a child centered, family focused, participatory process that is 
done with the family. The family assessment builds on family strengths.  It identifies 
parental capacities and resources within the family and the community.  The process is 
designed to incorporate parent/caretaker perceptions of child safety, address the 
presenting complaint, and determine service needs related to potential maltreatment of 
the child.  The family assessment can and should include the active involvement of all 
members of the family and significant others in the extended family or community, as 
appropriate.

Mandated Contacts for Family Assessments  
 
22VAC40-705-80(A)1-3 During the course of the family assessment, the 
child protective services (CPS) worker shall make and record the following 
contacts and observations.  
1. The child protective services worker shall conduct a face-to-face 
interview with and observe the alleged victim child and siblings. 
2. The child protective services worker shall conduct a face-to-face 
interview with the alleged victim child's parents or guardians and/or any 
caretaker named in the report. 
3. The child protective services worker shall observe the family 
environment, contact pertinent collaterals, and review pertinent records in 
consultation with the family. 
 
When it is possible and practical and places no family member in danger, contacts in a 
family assessment or investigation may be made with the family members together.  
However, the individual requirements for each contact should be documented in the 
automated data system. 
 
A family partnership meeting does not fulfill the requirement for any mandated 
contact interview during a family assessment or investigation as the purpose is 
not to interview alleged victims, parents/ caretakers, and collaterals. The CPS 
worker should conduct the face to face interview with the alleged victim child, 
siblings, and the parent/caretaker prior to any family partnership meeting.  
 
 
 
1.1 
Face-to-Face Interview with the Alleged Victim Child 
 
The CPS worker must conduct a face-to-face interview with the alleged 
victim child and should conduct this face-to-face contact within the 
response priority level assigned.  During the interview, the CPS worker 
should inform the child what will occur during the assessment process.  
The CPS worker should observe the child and document the child's 
recollection and perception of the allegations.  The CPS worker should 
note the child's emotional and physical condition (including any injury).  
The CPS worker should learn about the child's needs and capabilities for 
the purposes of risk assessment and service planning.  The CPS worker 
must document all interviews and attempted interviews in the automated 
data system.

Face-to-Face Interview with Siblings 
 
The CPS worker shall interview and observe siblings of the alleged victim 
child in order to determine whether they have experienced abuse or 
neglect and to more fully evaluate the family strengths and needs. 
 
1.3 
Interview of Non-Verbal Child 
 
In the case of an interview conducted with a non-verbal child, a child 
protective services worker shall document in detail in the automated data 
system the observations of the child interacting with his/her family 
members and environment. 
 
 
1.4   Interview with Alleged Abuser or Neglector 
 
22VAC40-705-80(A)(2).  The child protective services worker 
shall conduct a face-to-face interview with the alleged victim 
child’s parents or guardians and/or any caretaker named in the 
report. 
 
The CPS worker must conduct a face-to-face interview with the alleged abuser or 
neglector.  The alleged abuser or neglector must be informed of the allegations 
and the assessment process.  The CPS worker must document the alleged 
abuser’s or neglector’s responses and knowledge about the allegations.   
 
For the purposes of risk assessment and service planning, the CPS worker 
should identify the alleged abuser’s or neglector’s needs and capabilities.  If the 
alleged abuser or neglector refuses to be interviewed, the CPS worker must 
inform the alleged abuser or neglector that the family assessment must be 
completed to ensure child safety.   
 
 
1.5 
The Family Interview 
 
When it is possible, practical and places no family member in danger, the Family 
Assessment contacts may be made with the family members together.  This type 
of interview allows the CPS worker to observe interaction among family members 
that may contribute to the family needs assessment.  When a family interview is 
conducted, the CPS worker must document each of the individual required 
contacts in the automated data system.

The CPS worker must observe the family environment and determine the effect 
of the environment on the child’s safety and the overall family needs related to 
caring for the children. 
 
 
1.7   Interview Collaterals 
 
22VAC40-705-80(A)(3)[continued].  The child protective 
services worker shall… contact pertinent collaterals, and 
review pertinent records in consultation with the family. 
 
 
As part of the family assessment, the CPS worker may need to contact  
 
collaterals to evaluate the circumstances of the alleged abuse or neglect and the 
 
needs of the family.  The Virginia Administrative Code defines collateral.  
 
22VAC40-705-10:  "Collateral" means person whose personal 
or professional knowledge may help confirm or rebut the 
allegations of child abuse and/or neglect or whose 
involvement may help ensure the safety of the child. 
 
The CPS worker must contact any collaterals perceived to have pertinent 
information.  The CPS worker may involve collaterals to help ensure the safety of 
the child.  Contact with the child's other caretakers, such as babysitters or day 
care providers, is encouraged.  The CPS worker may make collateral contacts 
without the family's consent in order to complete a child protective services family 
assessment,  but consent and collaboration with the family is encouraged.  The 
family  assessment should be developed mutually with the family to the degree 
possible. 
 
The CPS worker shall interview nonvictim children as collaterals if it is 
determined that they may have information which would help in 
determining the finding in the complaint. Such contact should be made 
with prior consent of the child's parent, guardian or agency holding 
custody. If the situation warrants contact with the child prior to such 
consent being obtained, the parent, guardian or agency holding custody 
should be informed as soon as possible after the interview takes place.  
 
 
1.8 
Other Contacts May Be Required  
 
 
The CPS worker must contact the local Commonwealth Attorney and law 
 
enforcement to report suspected criminal activity.

data system. It is equally important that the worker document reasons why any 
mandated contacts or observations were not made or completed.  For example, if three 
phone messages were left or two home visits made with no one answering the door, 
those attempts should be documented in the automated data system.  
 
The first meaningful contact in the family assessment provides pertinent information 
relevant to the family assessment and the safety of the child and is usually a face-to-
face interview with the victim.  There could be circumstances in a family assessment 
where the first meaning contact is with the alleged abuser or collateral.  A first 
meaningful contact could be by telephone.  
 
The first meaningful contact must be documented as such in the automated data 
system.  The CPS worker should confer with a supervisor if there is any doubt about 
which contact constitutes the first meaningful contact.  
 
2.1 Changing the Initial Track From Family Assessment to Investigation 
 
After the referral is accepted as a family assessment, it may be switched to an 
investigation in very limited circumstances; however, a referral may not be 
switched from an investigation to a family assessment. If the family assessment 
has not yet been completed and new information causes the situation to meet the 
guidelines for an investigation, the family assessment must be closed and an 
investigation initiated. Refer to the CPS Differential Response Report Placement 
Chart in Part III for guidance on track decisions. Also, if an emergency removal 
occurs during a family assessment the family assessment must be closed and an 
investigation initiated. A new 45-day period begins to complete the investigation 
process.  A referral may not be switched from a family assessment to an 
investigation simply because of lack of cooperation on the part of the caretaker. 
The caretaker’s action or inaction that causes the child to be deemed unsafe may 
result in an action such as petitioning the court for a protective order to increase 
child safety. Track change decisions must be documented in the automated data 
system.  
 
3.0 
Information to be Included in Family Assessment 
 
In developing the case record and the family assessment narrative, the CPS worker 
must address and document in the automated data system these issues. Each family 
assessment may have circumstances warranting more or less details and information.

PART IV:  FAMILY ASSESSMENT AND INVESTIGATION 
 
The examples listed under each factor can be used as a guide for the CPS worker to 
elicit relevant information and identify family needs, strengths, and supports.  See 
Appendix for an example of a Family Needs Assessment form.  A comprehensive family 
assessment should address the family’s strengths and needs in four areas, including 
but not limited to the issues listed: 
 
• Children: age and ability to self-protect; presence of any disability or 
developmental delay; temperament; responsiveness to caretaker(s); prior history 
of abuse/neglect. 
• Parent/caretaker: physical, emotional, and intellectual status; prior history of 
abuse/neglect; potential for violence; substance abuse or dependency; domestic 
violence; neglectful acts or omissions, allegations of abuse/neglect. 
• Environment: any hazardous living conditions or positive factors present in the 
environment. 
• Support Systems: informal and formal; available or needed; past and present 
resource utilization. 
• The Family Assessment Summary must include the family members’ perceptions 
of the situation, needs and ability to meet those needs or accept services to meet 
them. It also includes an assessment of the likelihood (risk) of future abuse or 
neglect. 
 
There are tools in the Appendix that may assist CPS workers in evaluating the impact of 
possible substance abuse or domestic violence.   
The Family Assessment must be documented in the automated data system.  
It must include the rationale for the family risk decision and any identified service needs 
of the family to reduce or prevent child abuse or neglect.   
 
There is a sample Family Service Agreement in the Appendix that can be used to 
document service needs with the family.  As with the Safety Plan, development of an 
agreement for services should occur mutually with the family to the degree possible, 
and they should receive a copy of the agreement.   
 
4.0 
Reassign Family Assessment to Investigation as a Result of an Emergency 
Removal 
 
22VAC40-705-60(3b). When circumstances warrant that a child be taken 
into emergency custody during a family assessment, the report shall be 
reassigned immediately to an investigation. 
 
At any time before the completion of the family assessment, if circumstances require 
that emergency custody be taken of one or more children in the family, the alleged 
abuser must be notified immediately that the response of the agency has changed from 
a family assessment to an investigation.

All the requirements of an investigation are in effect and a new 45-day period begins in 
order to complete the investigation process.  A new investigation referral must be 
entered into the automated data system and the existing family assessment must be 
closed.  
 
5.0 
Determine Risk Level Based on Family Needs Assessment  
 
22VAC40-705-110(B).  In all founded cases and in completed family 
assessments, the child protective services worker shall make a risk 
assessment to determine whether or not the child is in jeopardy of future 
abuse and/or neglect and whether or not intervention is necessary to 
protect the child. 
 
The decision on risk of future harm should be based on the assessment of 
individual, family, and other risk factors. Any identified services for the family 
should be based on the needs identified in the Family Needs Assessment, which 
is documented in the automated information system.  The outcome of the Risk 
Assessment will influence the type and intensity of services to be provided.  One 
of these outcomes must be documented in the automated data system. 
 
a. 
High Risk:  The worker's assessment of risk related factors indicates a likelihood 
that the child is in jeopardy of abuse or neglect, and that intervention is 
necessary in  order to protect one or more children in the family. 
 
b. 
Moderate Risk:  The worker's assessment of risk related factors indicates that the 
 
child or other children are in possible jeopardy, but that a positive change in the 
 
situation is likely to occur with minimal intervention.   
 
c. 
Low Risk:  The worker's assessment of risk related factors indicates that the 
situation can and will be changed, that no additional intervention is necessary 
and that the child or other children are at no reasonably assessable risk of abuse 
or neglect.   
 
5.1 
Risk Level Determines Need to Convene Family Partnership Meeting 
 
 
A family partnership meeting should be scheduled by the local department when 
the worker assesses a child to be at “very high” or “high” risk of abuse and/or 
neglect and the child is at risk for out of home placement in those families who 
will be or are receiving services. This meeting is scheduled to develop the plan 
and services to prevent the out of home placement and identifies the 
circumstances under which a removal might be considered. The meeting should 
convene within 30 days of initiating services and prior to the development of the

6.0 
Supervisor Approval Required  
 
The CPS worker’s supervisor must approve the Family Assessment in the automated 
data system.  This approval means the supervisor has reviewed the Family Assessment 
to determine that all requirements have been met and that the Risk Assessment 
conclusion and rationale is appropriate. 
 
7.0 
Written and Oral Notification to Family to Summarize Family Needs 
Assessment  
 
The CPS worker must provide written and oral notification to the family that summarizes 
the family needs assessment, recommendations for services, and the length of time the 
family’s name will remain in the CPS automated data system.   It should outline the 
conclusions of the assessment and any services to be obtained by the family and/or 
provided to the family.  If continuing services are needed, it should be clear who will do 
what and by when, and what outcome is expected.   
 
8.0 
Family Refuses Services  
 
If the family refuses recommended services, the reason for the refusal must also be 
included in the written notification to the family and in the automated data system.   
 
The Family Service Agreement form in the Appendix can be photocopied and used to 
record the agreed upon actions by all parties or to note that these services were 
recommended but not agreed to by the family.

Notifications in Family Assessments 
 
22VAC40-705-140(B)(5). No disposition of founded or unfounded shall be 
made in a family assessment.  At the completion of the family assessment 
the subject of the report shall be notified orally and in writing of the results 
of the assessment. 
 
9.1  
Written Notification To Alleged Abuser or Neglector 
 
The written notification to the alleged abuser or neglector of the completed 
family assessment must be in the form of a letter and a copy must be 
included in the case record.  The written notification must include the

recommended, the length of time the family assessment will be retained, 
and the right to review information about him and/or herself in the record. 
 
9.2  
Verbal Notification To Alleged Abuser or Neglector 
 
The verbal notification to the family members of the conclusions of the 
completed family assessment should explain what needs were identified, 
what services are available to meet the needs, and how long information 
on the family assessment will be maintained in the automated data 
system. The worker must document in the automated data system the 
date the verbal notification took place or the reason the verbal notification 
did not occur.   
 
9.3  
Notification to the Complainant  
 
22VAC40-705-140(D)(3). When a family assessment is completed, the 
child protective services worker shall notify the complainant, when 
known, that the complaint was assessed and necessary action taken. 
 
 
9.4 
Notification to Military Personnel (Family Advocacy Program) 
 
The Code of Virginia § 63.2-1503(N) establishes authority for the local 
department to share CPS information about completed family 
assessments with family advocacy representatives of the United States 
Armed Forces.   
22VAC40-720-20 A.   Information regarding child protective services 
reports, complaints, investigations and related services and follow-
up may be shared with the appropriate Family Advocacy Program 
representative of the United States Armed Forces when the local 
agency determines such release to be in the best interest of the 
child. Provision of information as addressed in this chapter shall 
apply to instances where the alleged abuser or neglector is a 
member (or the spouse of a member) of the United States Armed 
Forces. In these situations coordination between child protective 
services and the Family Advocacy Program is intended to facilitate 
identification, treatment and service provision to the military family.

In completed family assessments with services needed where the alleged abuser 
or neglector is an active duty member of the United States Armed Forces or the 
spouse of a member residing in the member's household, the CPS worker shall 
provide information regarding the family assessment and the recommended 
services based on risk to the appropriate Family Advocacy Program within 30 
days of the completion of the Family Assessment.   See Part IX:  Confidentiality 
for guidance about disclosure of other information disclosure to military Family 
Advocacy Programs.

The military member shall be advised that this information is 
being provided to the Family Advocacy Program and shall be 
given a copy of the written notification sent to the Family 
Advocacy Program representative.  
 
G. 
Conduct Investigation  
 
22VAC40-705-70(A).  When conducting an investigation the local 
department shall seek first-source information about the allegation 
of child abuse and/or neglect.  When applicable, the local department 
shall include in the case record: police reports; depositions; 
photographs; physical, medical and psychological reports; and any 
electronic recordings of interviews. 
 
1.0 
Mandated Contacts in Investigation 
 
Mandated contacts to conduct an investigation are similar to the mandated contacts to 
conduct a family assessment.  There are additional requirements related to electronic 
recording of interviews of the alleged victim and alleged abuser/neglector.  Local 
departments must follow these additional requirements.    
 
A family partnership meeting does not fulfill the requirement for any mandated contact 
interview during a family assessment or investigation as the purpose is not to interview 
alleged victims, parents/caretakers, and collaterals. The CPS worker should conduct the 
face to face interview with the alleged victim child, siblings, and the parent/caretaker 
prior to any family partnership meeting.

Document Mandated Contacts 
 
22VAC40-705-80(B).  During the course of the investigation, 
the child protective services (CPS) worker shall make and 
record in writing in the state automated system the following 
contacts and observations. When any of these contacts or 
observations is not made, the CPS worker shall record in 
writing why the specific contact or observation was not made. 
 
 
The CPS worker must document the contacts required by regulation in the 
 
automated data system. It is equally important that the worker document reasons 
 
why any mandated contacts or observations were not made or completed.  For 
 
example, if three phone messages were left or two home visits made with no one 
 
answering the door, those attempts should be documented in the automated data 
 
system.

Face to Face Interview with the Alleged Victim Child Must Be Electronically 
Recorded 
 
In 2005, the Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals issued a ruling to affirm the regulatory 
requirement that victim interviews in an investigation must be electronically recorded 
according to 22VAC40-705-80 or clearly document the specific and detailed reasons for 
not taping victim interviews as well as the documentation that the decision was made in 
consultation with a supervisor.  A copy of this decision known as the West Decision is in 
the Appendix. 
 
22VAC40-705-80(B)(1).  The child protective services worker shall 
conduct a face-to-face interview with and observation of the alleged 
victim child and siblings. All interviews with alleged victim children 
must be electronically recorded … 
 
The CPS worker must conduct at least one face to face interview with the alleged 
victim child and should conduct this face-to-face contact within the response 
priority level assigned.  During the interview the CPS worker should inform the 
child about the investigation and what will occur during the investigation.  The 
CPS worker should observe the child and document the child's recollection and 
perception of the allegations.  The CPS worker should note the child's emotional 
and physical condition (including any injury).  The CPS worker should learn about 
the child's needs and capabilities for the purposes of risk assessment and 
service planning.

Some of this information may be obtained during the CPS worker’s observation 
of victim interviews conducted by other members of the investigative team 
including, but not limited to, law enforcement officers, forensic nurses, or 
physicians.  The CPS worker should review any electronically recorded victim 
interviews to determine if additional interviews are necessary to document the 
child’s allegations to comply with CPS guidance.   
 
A family partnership meeting does not fulfill the requirement for any mandated contact 
interview during a family assessment or investigation as the purpose is not to interview 
alleged victims, parents/ caretakers, and collaterals. The CPS worker should conduct 
the face to face interview with the alleged victim child, siblings, and the parent/caretaker 
prior to any family partnership meeting. 
 
 
2.1 
Exceptions to Electronically Taping Interviews with the Alleged 
Victim Child  
 
 
 
22VAC40-705-80(B) (1)   All interviews with alleged victim children 
must be electronically recorded except when the child protective 
services worker determines that:  
a. The child's safety may be endangered by electronic 
recording;  
b. The age and/or developmental capacity of the child makes 
electronic recording impractical;  
c. A child refuses to participate in the interview if electronic 
recording occurs; or  
d. In the context of a team investigation with law-enforcement 
personnel, the team or team leader determines that audio taping 
is not appropriate.   
e. The victim provided new information as part of a family 
assessment and it would be detrimental to re-interview the 
victim and the child protective services worker provides a 
detailed narrative of the interview in the investigation record. 
 
 
The Virginia Administrative Code provides five exceptions to audio or other 
electronic recording of an interview with an alleged victim child.  Before 
electronically recording an interview with a child, the CPS worker must assess 
the circumstances surrounding the allegations of abuse or neglect and determine 
whether any of the four exceptions precluding audio taping the interview apply. 
Adequately considering the circumstances may include assessing the complaint 
or report; speaking with the parents or guardians of the child; speaking with 
collateral witnesses; and conducting an assessment of the child.

PART IV:  FAMILY ASSESSMENT AND INVESTIGATION 
 
 
The CPS worker shall consult with the supervisor when the decision is made not 
to electronically record an interview with an alleged victim child.  The consultation 
and the specific reasons why electronic recording is not done in the specific 
investigation must be documented in the automated data system. 
 
2.1.1 Exception: The Child’s Safety May be Endangered by  
 
Electronic Recording 
 
If the child’s safety is endangered or may be endangered by 
electronically recording the interview, then the interview must not 
be electronically recorded.  The CPS worker may need to conduct a 
brief assessment of the child to determine the risk of any harm that 
may occur to the child as a result of electronically recording the 
interview.  The CPS worker may be able to assess any potential 
harm to the child by speaking with the child’s parents, guardians or 
collateral witnesses.   If the interview is not electronically recorded, 
the CPS worker must carefully document the details of the interview 
in writing for the case record. 
 
2.1.2 Exception: The Age or Developmental Capacity of the Child 
 
Makes Electronic Taping Impractical 
 
The CPS worker must assess the mental and physical capacities of 
the child.  The age or development of the child may preclude 
electronically taping the interview. It may be appropriate to 
electronically record the questions being asked by the child 
protective services worker and to describe, either verbally or in 
writing, the child’s responses. 
 
2.1.3 Exception: The Child Refuses to Participate in the  Interview if 
 
Electronic Taping Occurs 
 
The interview with the child should not be jeopardized because the 
child refuses to be electronically recorded.  If the child refuses to be 
electronically recorded, the CPS worker should explore the child’s 
reasons and discuss those reasons with the child.  If the child still 
refuses to participate in an electronically taped interview, then the 
CPS worker must not electronically record the interview.  The CPS 
worker must document the reasons why the child refused to be 
electronically recorded.

2.1.4 Exception: In the Context of a Team Investigation, the Team or 
 
Team Leader Determines that Electronic Recording is Not 
 
Appropriate 
 
If a complaint or report of abuse or neglect is being investigated in 
conjunction with a multidisciplinary team, then the multidisciplinary 
team should make the decision to electronically record the interview 
with the alleged victim child based on the specific child and referral.  
A team investigation includes a joint investigation with the 
Commonwealth’s Attorney office or law-enforcement.   
 
2.1.5 Exception:  The Victim Provided New Information as Part of a 
Family Assessment. 
 
 
If the victim provides new information during a family assessment resulting 
in an investigation and it would be and it would be detrimental to re-
interview the victim, the child protective services worker shall provide a 
detailed narrative of the interview in the investigation record and document 
this exception to electronically recording the victim interview.   
 
2.2 
Each Interview With the Alleged Victim Child Must be Electronically 
Recorded  
 
Each interview with the alleged victim child must be electronically recorded 
unless one of the above mentioned exceptions to electronically recording the 
interview applies.  When an interview is not electronically recorded for any 
reason, the CPS worker must complete a detailed summary of the interview, 
including the reasons for not recording the interview and the supervisory 
consultation for this decision and enter the information into the automated case 
record. 
 
2.3 
Notify the Child’s Parents or Caretakers that Interview was 
 
Electronically Recorded  
 
While there is no provision in the Code of Virginia or the Virginia Administrative 
Code that requires a local department to inform the child’s parents that the 
interview was electronically recorded, the local department should notify the 
parents or guardians of the alleged victim child about the interview and that the 
interview was electronically recorded.  
 
The local department should explain to the parents or guardians that the Code of 
Virginia allows the CPS worker to interview the alleged victim child without the

consent of the parents and the Virginia Administrative Code requires the 
interview to be electronically recorded.5   
 
 
2.4 
Parents or Caretakers Object to Electronically Recorded Interview 
 
There is no provision in the Virginia Administrative Code allowing an exception to 
electronic recording when the parents or guardians object to the local department 
electronic recording the interview of the alleged victim child.  The CPS worker 
should explore the foundation for the parents’ objection.  The objection to the 
electronic recording may satisfy one of the enumerated exceptions to electronic 
recording.   
 
 
2.5 
Equipment Malfunction or Other Cause 
 
22VAC40-705-80(B)(1) provides that a CPS finding may be based on the written 
narrative should equipment failure or “other cause” occur.  If an interview of an 
alleged victim child is not electronically recorded because of equipment 
malfunction or other cause, then the CPS worker must write a detailed narrative 
of the interview and include that narrative in the record.   
 
Equipment malfunction is self-explanatory. The Virginia Administrative Code 
does not define “other causes,” providing the local department with some 
discretion and flexibility in those situations where discretion and flexibility is 
needed so that the CPS investigation is not compromised.  For example, 
situations may occur where the alleged victim child spontaneously discloses 
details of the alleged abuse or neglect and the CPS worker does not have the 
recording equipment immediately available.   
 
Another example: the CPS worker transports the child to a medical examination.  
In the car, the child discloses important information about the alleged abuse.  
The CPS worker was not able to record the child’s statements.  In such a 
situation, the CPS worker should clearly delineate or summarize the child’s 
statements in the automated case record and the reasons why the child’s 
statements were not recorded.

The CPS worker must conduct a face to face interview with child's parents or guardians 
to obtain information about the child and about the parents’ or guardians’ knowledge of 
the allegations.  The CPS worker should inform the parents or guardians about the 
investigative process and provide sufficient information to involve them in planning and

the Commonwealth’s Attorney or the law-enforcement officer believes that 
the instruction will compromise the investigation of any criminal charges.   
 
This objection must be documented in the automated data system.   
 
4.1.2 Local Department Must Provide Recording Equipment Upon 
Request 
 
 
22VAC40-705-80(B)(2b.).  If requested by the alleged abuser 
and/or neglector the local department shall provide the 
necessary equipment in order to tape record the interview and 
retain a copy of the tape for the record.  
 
The CPS worker must be prepared to provide the equipment should the 
alleged abuser or neglector elect to electronically record the interview.  
The local department must provide a copy of the electronically recorded 
interview to the alleged abuser or neglector upon request.  
 
4.2 
Miranda Rights 
 
The Code of Virginia  § 63.2-1503(M) provides that statements made by the 
alleged abuser or neglector to the investigating CPS worker after the alleged 
abuser or neglector has been arrested are not admissible in any criminal 
proceedings unless the alleged abuser or neglector was advised of his rights 
against self-incrimination.  If a person suspected of abuse or neglect is arrested, 
that person must be advised of his rights against self-incrimination or any 
subsequent statements made by the person cannot be used during the criminal 
proceedings.  This section of the Code of Virginia only pertains to the 
admissibility in criminal proceedings of statements made by the alleged abuser or 
neglector after that person has been arrested.  This section of the Code of 
Virginia does not pertain to the use of any statements made by the alleged 
abuser or neglector in determining whether the complaint or report is founded or 
unfounded.  While certain statements made by the alleged abuser or neglector 
may not be admissible in a court of law, there is no specific exclusion to the local 
department using those statements in determining a founded or unfounded 
disposition.

criminal history record information from the Central Criminal 
Records Exchange on any individual who is the subject of a child 
abuse and neglect investigation where there is evidence of child 
abuse or neglect and the local department is evaluating the safety of 
the home and whether removal is necessary to ensure the child’s 
safety.  The local department may also obtain a criminal record 
check on all adult household members residing in the home of the 
alleged abuser and/or neglector and where the child visits.  Pursuant 
to §19.2-389 of the Code of Virginia, local departments are authorized 
to receive criminal history information on the person who is the 
subject of the investigation as well as other adult members of the 
household for the purposes in §63.2-1505 of the Code of Virginia.  
The results of the criminal record history search may be admitted 
into evidence if a child abuse or neglect petition is filed in 
connection with the child’s removal.  Local departments are 
prohibited from dissemination of this information excepted as 
authorized by the Code of Virginia. 
 
5.0  
Face-to-Face Interview with Siblings 
 
The CPS worker shall interview or observe siblings of the alleged victim child in 
order to determine whether they have experienced abuse or neglect and to more 
fully evaluate the family strengths and needs. 
 
6.0 
Observe Environment Where Child Lives and Visit the Site Where the 
Alleged Abuse or Neglect Occurred 
 
22VAC40-705-80(B)(4).  The child protective services worker shall

The CPS worker must contact any collaterals perceived to have pertinent information.  
The CPS worker may involve collaterals to help ensure the safety of the child.  Contact 
with the child's other caretakers, such as babysitters or day care providers, is 
encouraged.  The CPS worker may make collateral contacts without the family's 
consent in order to complete an investigation, but consent and collaboration with the 
family is encouraged. 
 
The CPS worker shall interview nonvictim children as collaterals if it is determined that 
they may have information which would help in determining the finding in the complaint. 
Such contact should be made with prior consent of the child's parent, guardian or 
agency holding custody. If the situation warrants contact with the child prior to such 
consent being obtained, the parent, guardian or agency holding custody should be 
informed as soon as possible after the interview takes place.  
 
8.0 
Other Contacts May Be Required 
 
The CPS worker may be required to contact other professionals depending on the type 
of CPS report.  They include: 
• Notify the local commonwealth attorney if a criminal act is alleged.   
• Notify the medical examiner and the regional CPS program consultant if there is 
a child fatality, 
• Notify local law enforcement if there is an alleged criminal act and a joint 
response is needed. 
 
9.0 
Document Any Mandated Contacts Not Made 
 
When any mandated contact or observation is not made, the worker must document 
why the specific contact or observation did not occur in the automated data system. 
 
10.0 Obtain Information to Complete the Investigation  
 
In developing the case record and the investigative narrative, the CPS worker must 
address and document in the automated data system these issues. Each investigation 
may have circumstances warranting more or less details and information.  
 
 
10.1 First Meaningful Contact 
 
The CPS worker must document the contacts required by regulation in the 
automated data system. It is equally important that the worker document reasons 
why any mandated contacts or observations were not made or completed.  For 
example, if three phone messages were left or two home visits made with no one

PART IV:  FAMILY ASSESSMENT AND INVESTIGATION 
 
answering the door, those attempts should be documented in the automated data 
system.  
 
The first meaningful contact in the investigation provides pertinent information 
relevant to the investigation and the safety of the child and is usually a face-to-
face interview with the victim.  There could be circumstances in an investigation 
that the first meaning contact is with the alleged abuser or collateral.  A first 
meaningful contact could be by telephone.  
 
The first meaningful contact must be documented as such in the automated data 
system.  The CPS worker should confer with a supervisor if there is any doubt 
about which contact constitutes the first meaningful contact.

a. 
Gather and document information about the alleged abuse 
or neglect incident, including the manner of infliction.  If

11.0 Dispositional Assessment 
 
22VAC40-705-110(C).  In investigations the child protective services 
worker shall make a dispositional assessment after collecting and 
synthesizing information about the alleged abuse or neglect. 
 
After collecting evidence and before expiration of the time frames for completing the 
investigation, the investigating social worker must determine the disposition.  The 
Virginia Administrative Code provides the definition of disposition. 
 
22VAC40-705-10:  "Disposition" means the determination of whether 
or not child abuse and/or neglect has occurred.

VIRGINIA DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES 
                                                            
Child Protective Services 
Volume VII, Section III, Chapter A 
 
PART IV:  FAMILY ASSESSMENT AND INVESTIGATION 
 
The Code of Virginia § 63.2-1505(B5) requires that the CPS worker make  a 
founded or unfounded disposition for each allegation in the investigation. For 
example, an investigation may show sufficient evidence that a child was 
physically abused and mentally abused. The CPS worker must make a 
disposition for each category of abuse or neglect.  Each separate disposition of 
abuse or neglect must be supported by a preponderance of the evidence on its 
own accord.   
 
It is possible that a category of abuse or neglect may have multiple types.  For 
example, the evidence establishes that the child sustained a spiral fracture and 
internal injuries as a result of the caretaker’s actions.  The local department may 
render a founded disposition of physical abuse with the type of “bone fracture” 
and a founded disposition of physical abuse with the type of “internal injury.”  
 
11.2  “Other Than Accidental Means”  
 
The injury or threat of injury to the child must have occurred as a result of “other 
than accidental means.”  The caretaker’s actions must be carefully considered 
when determining whether the injury or threat of injury sustained by the child was 
caused accidentally.   
 
For example, the complaint alleged that the caretaker caused bruises and 
abrasions on the child’s ankles and wrists.  The caretaker asserted that he did 
not intend to cause the injuries to the child; he intended to restrain the five year 
old boy with a rope.  However, the evidence shows that the caretaker tied the 
child’s legs at the ankles and tied the wrists to a chair, and when the child jerked 
in several different directions for over 20 minutes to try to get loose, injuries 
occurred to these parts of the body. The caretaker did not accidentally tie the 
child and leave him for 20 minutes.  Although the caretaker did not intend to 
cause the injuries to the child, the caretaker did intend to tie the child, and could 
reasonably expect this child would try to get loose. The caretaker’s act of 
restraining this child with a rope was intended and could have caused more 
serious harm.  The result of the caretaker’s actions was not unforeseen or 
unexpected.  Therefore, the injury was not accidental.   
 
In the alternative, a black eye to the child’s face while playing catch with the 
caretaker would be considered accidental.  The fact that the ball bounced off the 
child’s mitt and struck the child’s eye was not intended.  In the first example, the 
caretaker intended to discipline his child by restraining with a rope for 20 
minutes.  The intended act of restraining the child caused the injury to the child.  
In the second example, the caretaker did not intend for the ball to bounce off the 
child’s mitt and hit the child’s face.  The action causing the black eye was 
accidental.

11.3 Incapacitated Caretaker 
 
Physical neglect includes when the caretaker is incapacitated to the extent that 
the caretaker is prevented or severely limited in performing child caring tasks.  
Incapacitation may include physical incapacitation or mental incapacitation.  
Mental or physical incapacitation, in and of itself, is not sufficient for a founded 
disposition.  Incapacitation may include mental illness when the mental illness 
impairs the caretaker’s ability to provide for the child’s basic needs to the extent 
that the child’s safety or health is jeopardized.  Incapacitation may occur as a 
result of the caretaker’s use of controlled substances to the extent that the 
caretaker is unable to perform child caring duties. 
 
11.4 Unfounded Disposition 
 
The definition of an unfounded disposition as defined in the Virginia 
Administrative Code is: 
 
22 VAC 40-705-10:  "Unfounded" means that a review of the 
facts does not show by a preponderance of the evidence that 
child abuse or neglect occurred. 
 
However, an unfounded disposition may not mean that abuse or neglect did not 
occur, but rather that the evidence obtained during the investigation did not reach 
the preponderance level.  
 
 
 
 
11.4.1  Risk Assessment for Unfounded Investigation Not  Required 
 
The CPS worker may complete a risk assessment for an unfounded 
investigation if there appear to be service needs for the family to reduce 
the likelihood of abuse or neglect.   
 
11.4.1 Notifications in Unfounded Investigations 
 
 
 
a. 
Written Notification to Alleged Abuser or Neglector 
 
The alleged abuser or neglector must be notified in writing that the com-
plaint was determined to be unfounded.  A copy of the notification must be 
filed in the record and documented in the automated data system.  The 
notification must include the length of time the CPS report will be retained 
in the automated data system; the individual’s right to request the record 
be retained for an additional period; and the right to access information 
about himself in the investigative record.

PART IV:  FAMILY ASSESSMENT AND INVESTIGATION 
 
 
Although verbal notification of an unfounded investigation is not required 
by regulation, CPS workers are encouraged to discuss the outcome of the 
investigation as well as any services the family may need or request.   
 
22VAC40-705-140(B)(1).  When the disposition is 
unfounded, the child protective services worker shall 
inform the individual against whom allegations of abuse 
and/or neglect were made of this finding.  This 
notification shall be in writing with a copy to be 
maintained in the case record.  The individual against 
whom allegations of abuse and/or neglect were made 
shall be informed that he may have access to the case 
record and that the case record shall be retained by the 
local department for one year unless requested in 
writing by such individual that the local department 
retain the record for up to an additional two years. 
 
 
 
 
b. 
Inform Alleged Abuser or Neglector of Legal Recourse if  
 
 
 
Complaint Is Malicious 
 
22VAC40-705-140(B)(1)(b).  The local worker shall notify 
the individual against whom allegations of abuse and/or 
neglect were made of the procedures set forth in § 63.2-
1514 of the Code of Virginia. 
 
 
 
c. 
Upon Request Advise Alleged Abuser if Complainant is   
 
 
 
Anonymous 
 
 
 
22VAC40-705-40(E).  Upon request, the local department shall   
 
 
advise the person who was the subject of the complaint if the   
 
 
complaint or report was made anonymously. 
 
In all unfounded complaints, the worker must inform the alleged abuser or 
neglector that he may petition the court to obtain the identity of the com-
plainant if the alleged abuser believes the complaint was made in bad faith 
or maliciously.    
 
The CPS worker may provide the alleged abuser or neglector with a copy 
of the Code of Virginia § 63.2-1514 pertaining to reports or complaints 
made in bad faith or maliciously.  Upon request, the local department shall 
advise the person who was the subject of an unfounded investigation if the 
complaint or report was made anonymously, as  required by the Code of

Alleged Abuser or Neglector May Request Retention of the  
 
 
 
Record 
22VAC40-705 (A)6. The individual against whom unfounded 
allegations of abuse and/or neglect were made may request in 
writing that the local department retain the record for an 
additional period of up to two years.  
 
 
e. 
Record Shall be Purged Upon Court Order 
  
22VAC40-705-130(A)(7).  The individual against whom 
allegations of abuse and/or neglect were made may 
request in writing that both the local department and the 
department shall immediately purge the record after a 
court rules that the report was made in bad faith or with 
malicious intent pursuant to §63.2-1514 of the Code of 
Virginia. 
 
 
 
f. 
Notify Alleged Abuser or Neglector in Unfounded Investigation 
 
 
 
Involving the Death of a Child 
 
22VAC40-705-140(B)(1)(c).  When an unfounded 
investigation involves a child death, the child protective 
services worker shall inform the individual against 
whom allegations of abuse and/or neglect were made 
that the case record will be retained for the longer of 12 
months or until the State Child Fatality Review Team has 
completed its review of the case pursuant to § 32.1-
283.1(D) of the Code of Virginia. 
 
 
 
g. 
Notify Victim Child's Non Custodial Parent or Guardian  
 
22VAC40-705-140(C)(1).  When the disposition is 
unfounded, the child protective services worker shall 
inform the parents or guardian of the subject child in 
writing, when they are not the individuals against whom 
allegations of child abuse and/or neglect were made, 
that the complaint involving their child was determined 
to be unfounded, and the length of time the child’s name 
and information about the case will be maintained.  The

Child Protective Services 
Volume VII, Section III, Chapter A 
 
PART IV:  FAMILY ASSESSMENT AND INVESTIGATION 
 
child protective services worker shall file a copy in the 
case record. 
Reasonable efforts must be made to notify the non-custodial parent of the 
alleged victim child when that parent is not the subject of a report of child 
abuse or neglect.  Not only does the parent have a right to know, he or 
she may be a resource to the child. However, if there is reason to believe 
that contact would be detrimental to the child that should be taken into 
consideration.  If notification does not occur for this or any reason, that 
reason should be documented in the automated data system.  For siblings 
or other children residing in the home who are not identified as alleged 
victims, reasonable efforts to notify the non-custodial parent is at the 
discretion of the local department.  CPS workers should consider the risk 
of future maltreatment to these children and the potential protective 
benefits of notification when making this decision.  
 
 
h. 
Notify Complainant of Unfounded Disposition 
 
22VAC40-705-140(D)(1).  When an unfounded 
disposition is made, the child protective services worker 
shall notify the complainant, when known, in writing that 
the complaint was investigated and determined to be 
unfounded.  The worker shall file a copy in the case 
record. 
 
 
11.5   Founded Disposition 
 
The definition of a founded disposition as defined in the Virginia Administrative 
Code is:    
22 VAC 40-705-10:  "Founded" means that a review of the facts 
shows by a preponderance of the evidence that child abuse and/or 
neglect has occurred.  A determination that a case is founded shall 
be based primarily on first source evidence; in no instance shall a 
determination that a case is founded be based solely on indirect 
evidence or an anonymous complaint. 
 
 
 
11.5.1 Preponderance of the Evidence  
 
The Virginia Administrative Code defines a preponderance of the 
evidence as:

VIRGINIA DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES 
                                                            
Child Protective Services 
Volume VII, Section III, Chapter A 
 
PART IV:  FAMILY ASSESSMENT AND INVESTIGATION 
 
22VAC40-705-10:  "Preponderance of evidence" means 
the evidence as a whole shows that the facts are more 
probable and credible than not.  It is evidence which is 
of greater weight or more convincing than the evidence 
offered in opposition. 
 
As the standard of proof in making a founded disposition of abuse or 
neglect, a preponderance of the evidence means that the evidence offered 
in support of the allegation is of greater weight than the evidence offered 
in opposition.  The evidence gathered should be evaluated by its 
credibility, knowledge offered and information provided.    
 
11.5.2 First Source Evidence    
 
First source evidence and indirect evidence are defined in the 
Virginia Administrative Code: 
 
22VAC40-705-10:  "First source" means any direct 
evidence establishing or helping to establish the 
existence or nonexistence of a fact.  Indirect evidence 
and anonymous complaints do not constitute first 
source evidence.   
 
“Indirect Evidence” means any statement made outside 
the presence of the child protective services worker and 
relayed to the child protective services worker as proof 
of the contents of the statement.   
 
 
In no instance can a founded disposition be based solely on indirect 
 
evidence or an anonymous complaint. 
 
  
 
a. 
First Source or Direct Evidence 
 
First source or direct evidence means evidence that proves a fact, 
without an inference or presumption, and which in itself, if true, 
conclusively establishes that fact.   First source evidence includes 
the parties and witnesses to the alleged abuse or neglect.  First 
source evidence also includes: witness depositions; police reports; 
photographs; medical, psychiatric and psychological reports; and 
any electronic recordings of interviews.  
 
Direct  evidence may include witnesses or documents.  For 
example, first source evidence would include a  witness who

actually saw the alleged act or heard the words spoken. First 
source evidence would also include the examining physician's 
report establishing  that the child sustained a spiral fracture.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
b. 
Indirect Evidence 
 
Indirect evidence, also known as circumstantial evidence, is 
evidence based on inference and not on personal knowledge or 
observation.6  Indirect evidence relies upon inferences and 
presumptions to prove an issue in question and may require 
proving a chain of circumstances  pointing to the existence or non-
existence of certain facts.   
 
There is no clear distinction between the reliability and credibility of 
first source evidence and indirect evidence.  It remains incumbent 
upon the local department to weigh the credibility of all the 
evidence when determining a disposition.  Indirect evidence may be 
used in support of a founded disposition; however, indirect 
evidence cannot be the sole basis for the disposition. 
 
11.6 Factors to Determine if Medical Neglect Has Occurred   
 
 
 
It is the parent’s responsibility to determine and obtain appropriate medical, 
 
mental and dental care for a child.  What constitutes adequate medical treatment 
 
for a child cannot be determined in a vacuum, but rather, each case must be 
 
decided on its own particular facts. 
 
The focus of the CPS response is whether the caretaker failed to provide medical 
treatment and whether the child was harmed or placed at risk of harm as a result 
of the failure.  Cultural and religious child-rearing practices and beliefs that differ 
from general community standards should not be considered a basis for medical 
neglect, unless the practices present a specific danger to the physical or 
emotional safety of the child. 
 
11.6.1  Treatment or Care Must Be Necessary 
 
The statutory definition of medical neglect requires that the parent 
neglects or refuses to provide necessary care for the child’s health.  
Therefore, the local department must establish that the caretaker’s failure 
to follow through with a complete regimen of medical, mental or dental 
care for a child was necessary for the child’s health.  The result of the

Volume VII, Section III, Chapter A 
 
PART IV:  FAMILY ASSESSMENT AND INVESTIGATION 
 
caretaker’s failure to provide necessary care could be illness or 
developmental delays.  
 
The challenging issue is determining when medical care is necessary for 
the child’s health.  Obviously, life-saving medical treatment is necessary 
and falls within the definition.  However, when parents or caretakers 
refuse medical care that is important to their child’s well being but is not 
essential to life, the issue becomes more complicated in determining 
whether the medical care is necessary.   
 
11.6.2  Assess Degree of Harm (Real or Threatened) to the Child 
 
When assessing whether the medical, mental or dental treatment is 
necessary for the child’s health, the local department should consider the 
degree of harm the child suffered as a result of the lack of care.  If the 
child has yet to suffer harm, then the local department should assess the 
likelihood that the child will suffer harm.  The greater the harm, the more 
necessary the treatment.   
 
In addition to harm, the local department should consider the type of 
medical, mental or dental condition involved and whether the condition is 
stable or progressive.  Whether the condition is stable or progressive may 
be an issue in determining the severity of the condition and the necessity 
of treatment.  If the condition of the child is stable, then the local 
department may consider deferring to the caretaker’s authority.  If the 
condition is progressive and left untreated, then the local department may 
give lesser deference to the caretaker’s authority. 
 
 
11.6.3 Parent Refuses Treatment for Life-Threatening Condition   
 
Pursuant to the Code of Virginia § 63.2-100, under certain conditions a 
parent’s decision to refuse a particular medical treatment for a child with a 
life-threatening condition shall not be deemed a refusal to provide 
necessary care.  Those conditions are: 
• The decision is made jointly by the parents or other person legally 
responsible for the child and the child;  
• The child has reached 14 years of age and sufficiently mature to have 
an informed opinion on the subject of his medical treatment;  
• The parents or other person legally responsible for the child and the 
child have considered alternative treatment options; and  
• The parents or other person legally responsible for the child and the 
child believe in good faith that such decision is in the child's best 
interest.

22VAC40-705-10:  Particular Medical Treatment means a process or 
procedure that is recommended by conventional medical providers 
and accepted by the conventional medical community. 
 
Sufficiently mature is determined on a case-by-case basis and 
means that a child has no impairment of his cognitive ability and is 
of a maturity level capable of having intelligent views on the subject 
of his health condition and medical care. 
 
Informed opinion means that the child has been informed and 
understands the benefits and risks, to the extent known, of the 
treatment recommended by conventional medical providers for his 
condition and the alternative treatment being considered as well as 
the basis of efficacy for each, or lack thereof. 
 
Alternative treatment options means treatments used to prevent or 
treat illnesses or promote health and well-being outside the realm of 
modern conventional medicine. 
 
Life-threatening condition means a condition that if left untreated 
more likely than not will result in death and for which the 
recommended medical treatments carry a probable chance of 
impairing the health of the individual or a risk of terminating the life 
of the individual. 
 
11.6.4  Assess Caretaker’s Rationale 
 
The most singular underlying issue in determining whether a child is being 
deprived of adequate medical care, and therefore, a medically neglected 
child, is whether the parents have provided an acceptable course of 
medical treatment for their child in light of all the surrounding 
circumstances.  The local department should consider whether the 
caretaker’s failure to provide necessary medical treatment was caused by 
ignorance or misunderstanding.  The local department should consider 
whether the caretakers obtained accredited medical assistance and were 
aware of the seriousness of their child’s affliction. The local department 
should weigh the possibility of a cure if a certain mode of treatment is 
undertaken and whether the caretakers provided their child with a 
treatment. The local department should consider whether the caretakers 
sought an alternative treatment recommended by their physician and have 
not been totally rejected by all responsible medical authority.

Volume VII, Section III, Chapter A 
 
PART IV:  FAMILY ASSESSMENT AND INVESTIGATION 
 
 
11.6.5  Assess Financial Capabilities & Poverty 
 
The local department should consider whether the caretaker’s failure to 
provide necessary medical treatment was caused by financial reasons or 
poverty.  Parents or caretakers should not be considered neglectful for the 
failure to provide necessary medical treatment unless they are financially 
able to do so or were offered financial or other reasonable means to do 
so. In such situations, a founded disposition may be warranted if, after 
appropriate counseling and referral, the parents still fail to provide the 
necessary medical care. 
 
11.6.6  Failure to Thrive Must Be Diagnosed by a Physician 
 
The CPS worker must document that the diagnosis of failure to thrive was 
made by a physician and the diagnosis was nonorganic failure to thrive. 
 
11.7  Child Under Alternative Treatment 
 
22VAC40-705-30(C)(1).  A child who, in good faith, is under 
treatment solely by spiritual means through prayer in 
accordance with the tenets and practices of a recognized 
church or religious denomination pursuant to §63.2-100 of the 
Code of Virginia, shall not for that reason alone be considered 
a neglected child. 
 
The Code of Virginia provides that no child shall be considered an abused or 
neglected child only for the reason that the child is under treatment solely by 
spiritual means through prayer in accordance with the tenets and practices of a 
recognized church or religious denomination.  The religious exemption to a 
founded disposition of child abuse or neglect mirrors the statute providing a 
religious defense to criminal child abuse and neglect.7   This exemption means 
that a founded disposition cannot be based only upon the religious practices of 
the parents or caretakers.  A founded disposition can be rendered for other 
reasons.  For example, if the parent caused the injury in the first place, the 
religious exemption would not apply.  The religious exemption to a founded 
disposition of abuse or neglect is designed to protect a family’s right to freedom 
                                                          
 
7  See: Va. Code § 18.2-371.1(C). Any parent, guardian or other person having care, custody, or control of a minor 
child who in good faith is under treatment solely by spiritual means through prayer in accordance with the tenets and 
practices of a recognized church or religious denomination shall not, for that reason alone, be considered in violation 
of this section.

of religion.  The religious exemption statute is not to provide a shield for a person 
to abuse or neglect a child.8 
 
Should there be question concerning whether a child is under the treatment in 
accordance with a tenet or practice of a recognized church or religious 
denomination, the local department should seek the court’s assistance.  The 
court should decide whether the parent or caretaker is adhering to religious 
beliefs as the basis for refusal of medical or dental treatment. 
 
11.8 Medical Neglect of Infants with Life-Threatening Conditions  
 
The Virginia Administrative Code 22 VAC 40-705-30(C) states that medical 
neglect includes withholding of medically indicated treatment.  The Virginia 
Administrative Code defines withholding of medically indicated treatment as 
specific to infants.  When conducting an investigation involving an infant deprived 
of necessary medical treatment or care, the local department must be aware of 
the ancillary definitions and guidance requirements.  
 
22VAC40-705-10. “Withholding of medically indicated 
treatment” means the failure to respond to the infant’s life-
threatening condition by providing treatment (including 
appropriate nutrition, hydration, and medication) which in the 
treating physician’s or physicians’ reasonable medical 
judgment will be most likely to be effective in ameliorating or 
correcting all such conditions. 
 
This definition applies to situations where parents do not attempt to get a 
diagnosis even when the child's symptoms are severe and observable.   
 
11.8.1  Withholding Medically Indicated Treatment When Treatment is 
 
Futile 
 
22VAC40-705-30(C)(2):  For the purposes of this 
regulation, “withholding of medically indicated 
treatment” does not include the failure to provide 
treatment (other than appropriate nutrition, hydration, or 
medication) to an infant when in the treating physician’s 
or physicians’ reasonable medical judgment: 
a.  The infant is chronically and irreversibly comatose;  
                                                          
 
8 The United States Supreme Court held in 1944 that "parents may be free to become martyrs themselves.  But it 
does not follow that they are free, in identical circumstances, to make martyrs of their children before they can reach 
the age of full and legal discretion when they can make that choice for themselves.”  Prince v. Massachusetts, 321 
U.S. 158, 170 (1944).

Volume VII, Section III, Chapter A 
 
PART IV:  FAMILY ASSESSMENT AND INVESTIGATION 
 
b.  The infant has a terminal condition and the provision 
of such treatment would: 
(1)  Merely prolong dying; 
(2)  Not be effective in ameliorating or correcting 
all of the infant’s life-threatening conditions; or 
(3)  Otherwise be futile in terms of the survival of 
the infant; or 
 
(4) The infant has a terminal condition and the provision 
of such treatment would be virtually futile in terms of the 
survival of the infant and the treatment itself under such 
circumstances would be inhumane. 
 
11.8.2 Definitions of Chronically and Irreversibly Comatose & 
Terminal Condition 
 
22VAC40-705-10:  “Chronically and irreversibly 
comatose” means a condition caused by injury, disease 
or illness in which a patient has suffered a loss of 
consciousness with no behavioral evidence of self-
awareness or awareness of surroundings in a learned 
manner other than reflexive activity of muscles and 
nerves for low-level conditioned response and from 
which to a reasonable degree of medical probability 
there can be no recovery. 
 
22VAC40-705-10: “Terminal condition” means a 
condition caused by injury, disease or illness from 
which to a reasonable degree of medical probability a 
patient cannot recover and (i) the patient’s death is 
imminent or (ii) the patient is chronically and irreversibly 
comatose. 
 
11.9 Founded Disposition Cannot be Based Solely on Anonymous 
 
Complaint 
 
A founded disposition cannot be based solely on an anonymous 
complaint.  An allegation of abuse or neglect, in and of itself, cannot prove 
that the alleged act or omission did or did not occur.  Because a person 
alleges that an act occurred does not mean that the act in fact did occur.  
The allegation must be proved or disproved by corroborating evidence.

PART IV:  FAMILY ASSESSMENT AND INVESTIGATION 
 
11.10  Alleged Abuser May Consult with the Local Department Prior to a 
Founded Disposition 
 
22VAC40-705-120D. The subject of the report or complaint may 
consult with the local department to hear and refute evidence 
collected during the investigation. Whenever a criminal charge is 
also filed against the alleged abuser for the same conduct involving 
the same victim child as investigated by the local department, 
sharing the evidence prior to the court hearing is prohibited.  
 
 
The alleged abuser may be informed at any time during the investigation that the 
facts are leading the worker toward making a founded disposition.  
 
If the alleged abuser/neglector wants to present additional evidence or refute 
evidence, the local department may afford this opportunity and consider such 
additional information prior to rendering the disposition. The investigation may be 
extended from 45 days to 60 days for this process to be completed.  
 
The request for a consultation prior to disposition does not apply if there are 
pending criminal charges involving the same victim child.   
 
11.11 Polygraph Examinations are Not Considered Reliable Evidence 
 
Polygraph examinations are not admissible as evidence in CPS 
administrative hearings and cannot be considered as evidence when a 
local department is making a disposition.  Since the Virginia Supreme 
Court has repeatedly ruled that polygraph examinations are scientifically 
unreliable, a local department cannot allow polygraph examinations to be 
entered in as evidence in support of a founded disposition.9   
 
 
11.12 Founded Disposition & Identity of Abuser is Unknown 
 
 
 
                                                          
9  In Robinson v. Commonwealth, 231 Va. 142, 341 S.E.2d 159 (1986), the Virginia Supreme Court stated, "[I]n a 
long line of cases, spanning almost thirty years, we have made clear that polygraph examinations are so thoroughly 
unreliable as to be of no proper evidentiary use whether they favor the accused, implicate the accused, or are agreed 
upon to by both parties."  Virginia courts have not specifically addressed the use of polygraphs in administrative 
hearings.  However, in light of the courts' strong opposition to using results of polygraph testing in evidence, we see 
no principled distinction between the use of a polygraph in court and use in an administrative hearing.  In Dept. of 
Public Safety v. Scruggs, 79 Md. App. 312, 556 A.2d 736 (1989), the court acknowledged that administrative 
agencies are not bound by the strict rules of evidence, but stated that such evidence must be competent.  The court 
found polygraph evidence so unreliable as to deem it "incompetent" evidence.  The Supreme Court relied on 
Robinson in 2004 in Elliott v. Commonwealth, 267 Va. 396, 593 S.E.2d 270 (2004).

PART IV:  FAMILY ASSESSMENT AND INVESTIGATION 
 
It is possible that an investigation reveals a preponderance of evidence 
establishing that the child was physically abused or physically neglected, 
but fails to establish, by a preponderance of that evidence, the caretaker 
responsible for the abuse or neglect.  If, after diligent efforts to identify the 
abuser, the identity of the abuser remains unknown, the local department 
may enter the abuser’s name as “unknown” into the automated data 
system.   
For example, the evidence establishes that the infant was shaken and 
sustained severe injuries.  The only persons with the opportunity to have 
caused the injuries were the parents of the infant and the babysitter who 
provided care for the infant on the night the injuries occurred.  However, 
the evidence is conflicting concerning who actually caused the injuries.  In 
such a situation, the local department may render a founded disposition of 
physical abuse with the identity of the abuser unknown. 
 
 
a. 
Abuser Identified After Disposition 
 
 
If new information is received subsequent to a disposition of Founded with 
Unknown Abuser, this information is to be treated as a new referral and 
requires a new investigation.  If the original information is still pertinent 
and relevant and there is sufficient reason not to re-interview all the 
required contacts, such as potential trauma to the child, the information 
from original interviews may be incorporated into the new investigation.  If 
this additional information allows for a founded disposition with a known 
abuser, it does not replace the original finding. 
 
 
12.0  Determine Level of Founded Disposition 
 
A founded disposition must be categorized into one of three levels.  
Categorization is dependent on the nature of the act and the seriousness of the 
harm or threatened harm to the child as a result of maltreatment.  In all founded 
cases, there may be circumstances influencing the severity of the abusive or 
neglectful incident.  The circumstances may increase or decrease the severity of 
harm or threatened harm.  
 
The level for a founded disposition must be supported by a preponderance of the 
evidence.  The evidence supporting the level must be documented in the record.  
The facts supporting the level will relate to the type and pattern of abuse/neglect, 
the vulnerability of the child, the effect or potential effect of the abuse/neglect and 
the action or inaction of the caretaker.

injuries/conditions, real or threatened, that result in or were 
likely to have resulted in serious harm to a child.  
 
Injuries or conditions that resulted in or were likely to have resulted in serious 
harm include but are not limited to: 
 
a. 
For physical abuse, the situation requires medical attention in order to be 
remediated; the injury may be to the head, face, genitals, or is internal and 
located near a vital organ; injuries located in more than one place; the 
injuries were caused by the use of an instrument such as a tool or 
weapon; an inappropriate drug was administered or a drug was given in 
an inappropriate dosage; child exposed to the production or sale of 
methamphetamine or other drug and is not able to self-protect. 
 
b. 
For neglect situations, the condition would be one where the child's 
minimal needs are rarely met for food, clothing, shelter, 
supervision, or medical care; the child is frequently unsupervised or 
unprotected; the child is left by the caretaker with no plan for the 
child's care or no information about the caretaker's whereabouts or 
time for return; or a young child is left alone for any period of time. 
 
c. 
For mental abuse or neglect, the child has engaged in self-
destructive behavior, or has required psychiatric hospitalization, or 
required treatment for severe dysfunction or for presenting a dan-
ger to self or others, or for problems related to the caretaker 
behavior. 
 
d. 
For sexual abuse, the situation would be one where there was 
genital contact, or force or threat was used, or the abuse had taken 
place over a period of time and there were multiple incidents.   
 
e. 
For medical neglect, caretaker failed to provide medical care in a 
life threatening situation or a situation that could reasonably be 
expected to result in a chronic debilitating condition. 
 
f. 
For non-organic failure to thrive, the syndrome is considered to be 
a form of physical or emotional maltreatment, so refer to b & c

likely to have resulted in moderate harm to a child.  
 
Injuries or conditions that resulted in or were likely to have resulted in 
moderate harm include but are not limited to: 
 
a. 
For physical abuse, the injury necessitates some form of minor 
medical attention; injury on torso, arms, or hidden place (such as 
arm pits); use of tool that is associated with discipline such as a 
switch or paddle, exposure to the production or sale of 
methamphetamine or other drugs and the child may not be able to 
self protect. 
  
b. 
For neglect situations, the condition would be one where the child's 
minimal needs are sporadically met for food, clothing, shelter, 
supervision, or medical care; or a pattern or one-time incident 
related to lack of supervision caused or could have caused 
moderate harm. 
 
c. 
For mental abuse or neglect, the situation would be one where the 
child's emotional needs are rarely met; the child's behavior is 
problematic at home or school;  
d. 
For sexual abuse, minimal or no physical touching but exposure to 
masturbation, exhibitionism, etc.  Caretaker makes repeated 
sexually provocative comments to the child; child is exposed to 
pornographic materials. 
 
e. 
For medical neglect, the situation is one in which a doctor has 
prescribed care to eliminate pain or remedy a condition but the 
caretaker has not followed through with appointments or 
recommendations; the child’s condition is not acute or life 
threatening but could be detrimental to the child’s mental or 
physical health.

harm to a child.  
 
Injuries or conditions that resulted in or were likely to have resulted in minimal 
harm include but are not limited to: 
 
a. 
For physical abuse, the situation requires no medical attention for 
injury, including minimal exposure to the production or sale of 
methamphetamine or other drugs.  
 
b. 
In physical neglect, child's minimal needs inconsistently met for 
food, clothing, shelter, supervision, or medical care; supervision 
marginal, poses threat of danger to child;  
 
c. 
For mental abuse or neglect, the situation would be one where the 
child's emotional needs are met sporadically with evidence of some 
negative impact on the child's behavior; 
 
d. 
For sexual abuse, there was no or minimal physical touching or 
exposure to sexual acts such as masturbation, exhibitionism, etc.  
Caretaker’s actions or behavior, such as making sexually 
suggestive comments to the child, causes or creates a threat of 
minimal harm to the child.   
 
e. 
For medical neglect, the situation may be one in which the child’s 
life is not in danger, the child is not experiencing discomfort at this 
time, but the medical authority reports medical treatment is needed 
to avoid illness or developmental delay.

PART IV:  FAMILY ASSESSMENT AND INVESTIGATION 
 
If the local department makes a founded disposition of abuse or neglect, then the local 
department must complete the third type of assessment, the risk assessment.   
 
The risk assessment identifies families that have low, moderate or high probabilities of 
future abuse or neglect.  A risk assessment is the CPS worker’s appraisal of the 
likelihood that without intervention a family will maltreat their children again.  Risk 
assessment does not predict recurrence, but can assess whether a family is more or 
less likely to have another incident without intervention by the local department.   
The risk level guides the local department’s decision whether or not to open a case to 
ongoing services and the intensity of those services.   
 
Risk of harm to the child may be visualized as a continuum ranging from low through 
high risk.  The evidence may show that the abusive or neglectful event was a one-time 
occurrence with no discernible risk of repeating in the future.  In the alternative, the 
evidence may show the risk of the child being abused or neglected in the future to be 
significant or high.   
 
The evidence gathered during the investigation, an analysis of its reliability and 
importance, and an evaluation of how the various risk factors interrelate determines the 
level of risk to the child.  It is critical that assessments regarding the degree to which the 
child is at risk continue to be made throughout the period of interaction with the family.   
 
The questions listed below relate directly to the facts collected during the investigation.  
The risk assessment results from the synthesis of the answers to the questions.  The 
risk assessment must take into consideration each of the identified factors and any 
other special circumstances that might influence the foreseeable risk of harm. 
 
13.1 Elements of Risk Assessment 
 
 
a. 
Incident  
 
When evaluating the incident, the essential consideration is the degree of 
harm to the child, including: 
 
 
a. 
How severe is the injury?  
 
 
b. 
Is the potential danger more or less severe because of the 
 
manner of infliction?   
 
c. 
Is the potential danger more or less severe because of a 
pattern of abuse or neglect?

PART IV:  FAMILY ASSESSMENT AND INVESTIGATION 
 
 
d. 
Is the precipitating event (or one very similar) likely to   
 
 
 
reoccur?   
 
 
b. 
Child   
 
The local department must evaluate the physical and mental vulnerability of the 
child.  When evaluating the vulnerability of the child, questions to consider 
include:   
 
a. 
Does the child's age, sex, developmental level, behavior, 
medical or physical conditions affect his or her vulnerability 
to abuse or neglect?   
 
b. 
Is the child able to protect him or herself from future abuse 
or neglect?   
 
c. 
Are the child's responses and feelings consistent or 
inconsistent  with what would be expected considering the 
circumstances of the CPS report? 
 
 
d. 
How does the child view his or her role in the abusive  or 
 
neglectful situation?  How does that impact on his or  her 
 
vulnerability for abuse or neglect?   
 
c. 
Caretaker  
The local department must evaluate the caretaker’s ability and willingness  in 
preventing future abuse or neglect.  Caretaker refers to both the abusing and 
non-abusing parent.  When evaluating the caretaker’s willingness or ability to 
prevent future abuse or neglect, questions to consider include: 
 
a. 
Do the caretakers demonstrate the ability to stop the  abuse 
or neglect?  
 
 
b. 
Has the abuse or neglect stopped or diminished? 
 
c. 
What plans do the caretakers have for the future or 
continued protection of the child? 
 
d. 
 How do the caretakers' views of the child impact their ability 
to protect the child? 
 
e. 
What impact do the following issues have on the caretaker’s 
ability to care for the child:  mental health, substance or drug

abuse, domestic violence, prior history of  abuse or neglect; 
prior/current  involvement with criminal justice system; 
physical or mental disability;  
 
 
d. 
Family   
 
Key considerations are the ability and willingness of the family to provide a safe 
home and protect the child.  When evaluating the family’s willingness or ability to 
prevent future abuse or neglect, questions to consider include: 
 
a. 
How do the dynamics, communication, roles, and 
responsibilities of the family members increase or decrease 
the potential for abuse or neglect to the child?   
 
 
b. 
In what way do the family's characteristics and  behaviors 
 
impact on their ability to provide a safe home for the child?   
 
 
c. 
How does the family's view of the child impact their ability to 
 
provide a safe home and protect the child?   
 
 
 
e. 
Other   
 
a. 
How do the characteristics and behaviors of others who 
have access to the child impact the potential for abuse or 
neglect of the child?   
 
b. 
How do the factors in the environment (both in and outside 
the home) impact the potential for abuse and neglect of the 
child?   
 
 
c. 
How does the intervention of the judicial system impact the 
 
potential for abuse or neglect of the child? 
 
 
d. 
How do the obstacles or barriers to services that are needed 
 
impact the potential for abuse or neglect of the  child or other 
 
children?   
 
e. 
What impact has this CPS intervention or prior CPS 
intervention had on potential abuse or neglect of the child?

13.2   Determine the Risk Level for Founded Investigation 
 
The risk assessment must be categorized into one of the following three levels 
and documented in the automated data system: 
 
a. 
High Risk 
 
The worker's assessment of risk related factors indicates a likelihood that 
the child is in jeopardy of abuse or neglect, and that intervention is 
necessary in order to protect the child or other children. 
 
b. 
Moderate Risk 
 
The worker's assessment of risk related factors indicates that the child or 
other children are in possible jeopardy, but that a positive change in the 
situation is likely to occur with minimal intervention.   
 
c. 
Low Risk 
 
The worker's assessment of risk related factors indicates that the situation 
can and will be changed, that no additional intervention is necessary, and 
that the child or other children are at no reasonably assessable risk of 
abuse or neglect.   
 
13.3 Risk Level Determines Need to Convene Family Partnership Meeting 
 
 
A family partnership meeting should be scheduled by the local department when 
the worker assesses a child to be at “very high” or “high” risk of abuse and/or 
neglect and the child is at risk of out of home placement in those families who will 
be or are receiving services. This meeting is scheduled to develop the plan and 
services to prevent the out of home placement and identifies the circumstances 
under which a removal might be considered. The meeting should convene within 
30 days of initiating services and prior to the development of the ongoing service 
plan.  The family partnership meeting must be documented in the automated 
data system.  For guidance on conducting the family partnership meeting refer to:

14.0 Cannot Reopen a Closed Investigation 
 
There is no basis in the Code of Virginia or the Virginia Administrative Code for 
“reopening” a closed investigation.  When new or additional information is received after

a complaint has been determined to be Unfounded, the new/additional information may 
be sufficient to meet the validity criteria for a new CPS report.  If the new information 
adds nothing more to the original complaint, the report should be screened out.  
 
15.0 Notifications in Founded Investigations 
 
15.1 Notify Abuser or Neglector in Writing 
 
The written notification to the abuser or neglector of the founded 
disposition(s) must be in a letter and a copy must be included in the case 
record.  The letter must include: 
• A clear statement that the individual is the abuser and/or neglector; 
and 
• The category of abuse and/or neglect; and 
• The disposition, level and retention time, including statement about 
effect of multiple complaints on retention; and 
• The name of the victim child or children; and 
• A statement informing the abuser of his/her right to appeal the 
finding and to have access to the case record; and 
• A statement informing the abuser that pursuant to § 63.2-1505 of 
the Code of Virginia, if the abuser is a teacher in a public school 
division in Virginia, the local school board shall be notified of the 
founded disposition. 
 
Local departments are encouraged to send the disposition letter by 
certified mail as further documentation of the notification to the abuser or 
neglector.   
 
15.1.1  Additional Notification to Alleged Abuser in Certain 
 
Founded Sexual Abuse Investigations 
The Code of Virginia  § 63.2-1514(A) requires that all records related to 
founded cases of child sexual abuse involving injuries or conditions, real 
or threatened, that result in or were likely to have resulted in serious harm 
to a child shall be maintained by the local department for a period of 25 
years from the date of the complaint.  All investigation records founded on 
or after July 1, 2010 for sexual abuse investigations level 1 shall be 
maintained by the local department 25 years from the date of the 
complaint.  This retention timeframe will not be reflected in the Central 
Registry past the purge dates set out in 22VAC40-700-30.   
For all sexual abuse investigations founded level 1 on or after July 
1, 2010, the written notification shall include a statement informing

the alleged abuser that the investigation record shall be maintained 
by the local department for 25 years past the date of the complaint 
pursuant to § 63.2-1514(A) of the Code of Virginia; however, this 
retention time will not be reflected in the Central Registry past the 
purge date of 18 years as set out in 22VAC40-700-30.  
 
15.2 Inform Abuser or Neglector of Appeal Rights  
 
The abuser or neglector must be informed of his right to appeal the founded 
disposition.  This must be done verbally and in writing as soon as the disposition 
is reached.  In addition, the abuser or neglector must be given a brochure, "Child 
Protective Services Appeals and Fair Hearings" that outlines the administrative 
appeal process.   The local department must document in the automated data 
system that the abuser or neglector was given the appeal brochure and was 
informed verbally of his/her appeal rights.     
 
15.3  Notify Abuser or Neglector Verbally 
 
The verbal notification to the abuser or neglector of the founded disposition(s) 
should include the disposition, level and retention time, including effect of 
multiple complaints on retention and inform the abuser of his/her right to appeal 
to finding and to have access to the case record.  The worker must document in 
the automated data system, the date the verbal notification took place.  If the 
verbal notification did not occur, the CPS worker should document the reasons in 
the automated data system. 
  
 
15.4  Foster Parent is Abuser or Neglector of the Victim Child in Founded 
 
Complaint 
 
22VAC40-705-140(B)(4).  When the abuser and/or neglector in a 
founded complaint is a foster parent of the victim child, the 
local department shall place a copy of this notification letter in 
the child's foster care record and in the foster home provider 
record. 
 
15.5 Notify All Parties if Identity of Abuser or Neglector is Unknown 
 
If the local department renders a founded disposition with the abuser unknown, 
the local department must notify all parties, including the parents or guardian of 
the child, the alleged abuser or neglector and the complainant.  All parties must 
be informed that the investigation resulted in a finding that the child was abused 
or neglected, but the evidence did not establish the identity of the perpetrator.

Volume VII, Section III, Chapter A 
 
PART IV:  FAMILY ASSESSMENT AND INVESTIGATION 
 
The alleged abuser or neglector should be notified that a finding of abuse or 
neglect was not made against that person.  Because the abuser or neglector is 
unknown, no party has the right to an administrative appeal of the founded 
disposition. 
 
The complainant should be notified that necessary action was taken.   
 
15.6 Notify All Parties if Abuser or Neglector is Deceased  
 
If the alleged abuser or neglector is deceased at the time of the report or dies 
during the course of the investigation, the local department must evaluate 
whether the purpose of the investigation would be achieved.  An investigation 
may be appropriate if there is a child victim in need of services or in order to 
prevent other abuse or neglect.   
 
If the local department renders a founded disposition and the named abuser or 
neglector is deceased, the local department must notify all parties, including the 
deceased abuser or neglector’s estate.  The notification letter must state that the 
identity of the alleged abuser or neglector will be referred to as “deceased” in the 
automated data system.  Because the abuser or neglector is deceased, no party 
has the right to an administrative appeal of the founded disposition.  
 
The complainant should be notified that necessary actions were taken. 
 
15.7 Notify Victim Child's Non Custodial Parent or Guardian  
 
22VAC40-705-140(C)(2).  When the disposition is founded, the 
child protective services worker shall inform the parents or 
guardian of the child in writing, when they are not the abuser 
and/or neglector, that the complaint involving their child was 
determined to be founded and the length of time the child’s 
name and information about the case will be retained in the 
Central Registry.  The child protective services worker shall 
file a copy in the case record. 
Reasonable efforts must be made to notify the non-custodial parent of the 
alleged victim child when that parent is not the subject of a report of child abuse 
or neglect.  Not only does the parent have a right to know, he or she may be a 
resource to the child. However, if there is reason to believe that contact would be 
detrimental to the child that should be taken into consideration.  If notification 
does not occur for this or any reason, that reason should be documented in the 
automated data system.  For siblings or other children residing in the home who 
are not identified as alleged victims, reasonable efforts to notify the non-custodial

parent is at the discretion of the local department.  CPS workers should consider 
the risk of future maltreatment to these children and the potential protective 
benefits of notification when making this decision. 
For all sexual abuse investigations founded level 1 on or after July 1, 
2010, the notification to the parent of the alleged victim child shall include 
a statement  that the investigation record shall be maintained by the local 
department for 25 years past the date of the complaint pursuant to § 63.2-
1514(A) of the Code of Virginia; however, this retention time will not be 
reflected in the Central Registry past the purge date of 18 years as set out 
in 22VAC40-700-30.  
 
15.8 Notify Complainant  
 
22VAC40-705-140(D)(2).  When a founded disposition is made, 
the child protective services worker shall notify the 
complainant, when known, in writing that the complaint was 
investigated and necessary action was taken.  The local 
worker shall file a copy in the case record. 
 
15.9 Notify Military Personnel (Family Advocacy Program) 
 
The Code of Virginia § 63.2-1503(N) establishes authority for the local 
department to share CPS information with family advocacy representatives of the 
United States Armed Forces.   
 
22VAC40-705-140(E).  Family Advocacy Program.  When a founded 
disposition is made, the child protective services worker shall notify 
the Family Advocacy Program representative in writing as set forth 
in 22 VAC 40-720-20.   
 
In founded complaints where a need for protective services is identified in which 
the abuser or neglector is an active duty member of the United States Armed 
Forces, or the spouse of a member residing in the member's household, 
information regarding the disposition, type of abuse or neglect, and the identity of 
the abuser or neglector shall be reported to the appropriate Family Advocacy 
Program representative at the time of the disposition. See Part IX:  Confidentiality 
of this manual for guidance on other information disclosure to Family Advocacy.

15.10 Referral To Early Intervention Programs For Children Under Age 
Three In Founded Investigations 
 
 
The CPS worker is required to refer a child under the age of three in a founded 
investigation for early intervention services.  All localities are served by an Infant 
& Toddler Connection of Virginia program. This referral is required by the Child 
Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA).  In Virginia, the eligible 
population is infants and toddlers from birth to age three who are 
developmentally delayed, who have atypical development, or who have a 
diagnosed physical or mental condition that has a high probability of resulting in 
delay.  
 
Local departments are encouraged to meet with the local Infant and Toddler 
program to learn about any referral issues that should be explained to the parent. 
Local departments are also encouraged to develop procedures with the Infant & 
Toddler Connection of Virginia program to make referrals of children under age 
three in founded investigations who may be eligible for these services.  
Recommended elements of these procedures could include: 
 
• Within five (5) working days of completing the investigation the local 
department of social services will send a referral to the local Part C 
Early Intervention program using the local referral form. 
• The local department will send a copy of the referral to the family with 
the notice of disposition. The parent shall also be informed verbally of 
the referral and have an opportunity to discuss the referral process. 
• The local department will request the family to sign a release form 
allowing the exchange of information between the Infant-Toddler 
Connection Program and the local department regarding the referral. 
 
More information on the Infant & Toddler programs in Virginia can be found at 
www.infantva.org. and in the joint Memorandum of Understanding issued by the 
Commissioners of the Department of Social Services and Department of

part-time, permanent, or temporary teacher in a school division located 
within the Commonwealth, the local department shall notify the local 
school board of the founded disposition made after July 1, 2008 at the 
same time the subject is notified of the founded disposition.  This includes 
in home investigations when the teacher is the subject of the founded 
investigation involving his own children. Any information exchanged for the 
purposes of this subsection shall not be considered a violation of § 63.2-
102, 63.2-104 or 63.2-105. 
 
The local department may send a copy of the disposition letter to the 
subject of the complaint to the local school board to meet this notification 
requirement.   
 
This notification requirement applies only to teachers who are employed 
by a local school board at the time of the disposition of the complaint.  The 
notification requirement does not apply to other local school board 
employees.

a License Issued by the Board of Education 
 
Pursuant to § 63.2-1503 P of the Code of Virginia, the local department shall 
notify the Superintendent of Public Instruction when an individual holding a 
license issued by the Board of Education is the subject of a founded complaint of 
child abuse or neglect and shall transmit identifying information regarding such

16.0 Investigation of Medical Neglect of Disabled Infants with Life-Threatening 
 
Conditions 
 
After receiving a complaint or report involving the withholding of medical 
treatment of an infant, the local department should initiate contact with the 
designated person in the hospital.  The local department should arrange with the 
local hospital for naming a contact person or liaison.  The local department may 
contact the CPS State Hotline because the hospital’s contact name is available 
from the CPS State Hotline and the list is updated annually.  Upon receipt of the 
complaint or report, the CPS worker should immediately:   
 
a. 
Verify the child's presence at the hospital by contacting the 
hospital’s liaison;  
 
 
b. 
Verify the child's status.  
 
16.1 Contact Physician or Hospital Staff 
 
The local department should arrange to meet with the attending physician or the 
Infant Care Review Panel and conduct a visit to the hospital to verify the child’s 
situation.   
 
16.2 Determine Who is Responsible for the Child 
 
The CPS worker should make a site visit and determine who is responsible for 
the child.  This will usually be the child's parents, unless the parents have 
abdicated their authority.  Situations when the parents are not responsible 
include, but are not limited to:   
 
a. 
When parents permanently voluntarily entrust the child to an 
agency;

16.3 Seeking Court Assistance 
 
When treatment appears necessary and the Court is available to act on a 
petition the worker can:   
 
a. 
Petition the Court for custody so that treatment can be provided; 
 
b. 
Petition the Court for a Protective Order specifying that treatment 
be provided.  
 
When emergency treatment is necessary and the Court is unavailable, the 
worker should consider taking the child into custody pursuant to The Code 
of Virginia §63.2-1517. 
 
I. 
Family Assessment and Investigation Case Record 
 
All family assessments or investigations must be documented in the automated data 
system. The CPS worker will collect information from a variety of sources in conducting 
a family assessment or investigation.   
 
1.0 
All Family Assessments and Investigations Must be Documented in the 
Automated Data System 
 
22VAC40-705-10:  "Documentation" means information and materials, 
written or otherwise, concerning allegations, facts and evidence. 
 
Thorough and detailed documentation of the family assessment or investigation is
