Who is it?
Statehood Day is just the start of a months-long celebration that will reach every corner of Ohio.
Other activities will include a Tall Ships festival on the Lake Erie coastline in July, a re-enactment of
a wagon train cross the state in June and July, a riverboat festival on the Ohio River in October, and
a month-long celebration of the centennial of flight in Dayton in July. The celebration will also
include two days of fireworks, and entertainment in Columbus July 3-4.
These activities will happen on top of other projects that the Ohio Bicentennial Commission has
undertaken over the past several years. One ongoing project will see 250-pound bronze Bicentennial
Bells cast in 41 Ohio Counties. This project began in 2001 as a partnership between the Bicentennial
Commission and the Verdin Company of Cincinnati, Ohio's oldest family-owned manufacturer.
When completed, the project will have cast a personalized bell in each of Ohio's 88 counties during
a two-day, out-in-the-open event.
Another enormously popular program has seen the Bicentennial Commission paint its logo on a
barn in each Ohio County. The barn paintings have become extremely popular, with hundreds of
Ohioans cris-crossing the state to visit and photograph all 88 barns.

In addition, the Ohio Department of Public Safety (ODPS) began distributing the bicentennial
plate in October 2001.  The ODPS sold 1,384,013 bicentennial plates in 2001.  In 2002, there
were 3,629, 611 plates sold.  More than 5 million plates
are now on the road advertising the bicentennial year.
IT’S  ABOUT  SAFETY
Community-based bicentennial celebrations will take place
in the form of 40 Commission-funded Legacy Projects,
which include antique car rallies, exhibits, living history
performances and lecture series in different parts around
the state.
A full list of all bicentennial activities, including a monthly
Calendar of Events, is available at the Ohio Bicentennial
Commission Web site, www.ohio200.com.  Look for

PATROL CARS CRUISE
TO A NEW COLOR
Performance Ratings
of Deputy Registrars
Lead to Fee Increase
The color is white.  The reason is visibility.  On February 14, 2003, the Ohio
State Highway Patrol (OSHP) premiered its new Patrol cruiser at the an-
nual awards banquet in Columbus.  The Trooper of the Year, Sgt. Matthew
R. Crow, received the first one and each district will be given one new car.
Gradually, the other charcoal gray cars will be phased out, usually when a
car reaches 85,000 miles, which is approximately 33 months of service.  It
will take several years to change over the 1,200 marked Patrol cars.
The current dark color tends to blend in with roads during the day and can't
be seen at night.  The death of two troopers in less than three years is a
factor in the switch.  Trooper Robert Perez was completing paperwork on
a routine traffic stop on the Ohio Turnpike in Sandusky when a speeding
car hit the cruiser from behind and killed him on May 15, 2000.
On November 5, 2001, Trooper Frank Vazquez was approaching a car on
Interstate 270 in Columbus when a sport utility vehicle hit him, the cruiser
and the car he stopped.  Vazquez died the next day.
Effective January 1, 2003, the
deputy registrar fee increased from
$2.75 to $3.25. A provision of the
State's general revenue budget bill
(HB 94), provided for an annual re-
view of deputy registrars for the
purpose of determining fees which
will be paid to transact driver li-
cense and vehicle registration
functions on behalf of the Bureau
of Motor Vehicles (BMV).  The fee
is collected to reimburse deputy
registrars for their expenses in per-
forming driver and vehicle registra-
tion services on behalf of the state.
Deputy registrars and their em-
ployees are not state employees.
Patrol cruisers were white from 1970 until 1981.  They became silver in
1983 to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the founding of the Patrol. In
1992, the cars became charcoal.
The decision to change colors was made last September, after the first
Patrol Car Committee meeting. Committee members met one evening to
observe a patrol car demonstration in a parking lot on the state fairground.
Headed by Major Robert Cassidy, the other members included Lt. Col.
Michael W. Finamore, Capt. Lisa Taylor, Lt. Jim Wernecke, Lt. Brian Charles,
Lt. Rick Fambro, Lt. C. Lance Mathess, MCES Milan Orbovich, Sgt. Kay
Perkins, Sgt. Walter Davis, Sgt. Dennis Lee, Fleet Mgr. Joe Price, Sgt. John
Rinko, Tpr. Kenneth Metz, and Tpr. Mark Neff.
The consensus of the committee was that the white Crown Victoria pro-
vided far superior visibility at night when compared to the current issue gray
patrol car. The new white cruisers will continue to move the Patrol in the
direction of providing troopers with the safest, most reliable, and best equip-
ment available.

The 50-cent increase is the result
of the deputy registrars receiving
a statewide satisfaction rating of
90-percent or better on surveys
conducted by The Ohio State Uni-
versity. The study focused on the
delivery of services to Ohioans by
the 215 deputy registrar agencies.
The BMV's Registrar stated that the
results of the study are encourag-
ing and confirm that the BMV is
moving in the right direction with
their customer focused approach.
According to the survey, 90 percent
of respondents reported a favor-
able opinion regarding the perfor-
mance of the BMV and 93 percent
indicated that the Deputy Registrar
Agency they visited met or ex-
ceeded their expectations of qual-
ity customer care.

The deputy registrar fee is used in
transactions dealing with vehicle
registrations, out-of-state inspec-
tions, driver licenses, state identi-
fication cards and endorsement
issuances. The fee increase will
affect transactions completed
through the deputy registrars, mail,
phone and Internet.

 ESA Awards for Fourth
Quarter
The Excellence in Service (ESA) Awards ceremony was held on
January 8, 2003, in the Shipley Building Atrium.  The following
employees received awards:
According to a study that appeared
in the August issue of the American
Journal of Public Health, by the year
2030, about 7 million baby boomers
age 85 and older will have stopped
driving and will be forced to rely on
other forms of transportation.
With this dependency comes a host
of issues for baby boomer families
and society in general. The study says
that more than 600,000 Americans
stop driving each year.  This number
is expected to rise sharply as baby
boomers begin to retire.

Seniors stop driving because of poor
eyesight, memory problems or other
health-related problems that make it
difficult for them to get behind the
wheel, according to Jeff Runge, the
administrator for the National Highway
Traffic 
Safety Administration
(NHTSA).
It becomes harder for older people to
rely on bus transportation because
they may have trouble walking to the
bus stop.  Some communities have
begun offering services that provide
curb-to-curb service; but in many
places, seniors have to rely on family
and friends.
Runge suggests that adult children
take a hard look at the situation be-
fore a crisis occurs and says it is of-
ten a person's doctor that can assess
the situation and help tell the older
person they are no longer fit to drive.
