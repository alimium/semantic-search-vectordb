 I am truly honored to represent the residents of House District 23 in the State Legislature.  
This past session produced some good legislation in the areas of public safety and tax 
relief.  I focused my efforts in the areas of the Ala Wai Watershed, Harbor Repair, Elder 
Care, Noise Abatement and Homeless Issues.   Significant progress was made in these 
areas, but I believe there is much more work to be done.  That is why I will seek election to 
continue serving the citizens of Ala Moana, Kaka’ako and Waikiki.  
If I am elected, I will continue to work on the above areas as well as for tax relief for 
businesses and residents.  The need for infrastructure upgrades in the areas of water, 
sewage and electrical service has become a critical issue for House District 23.   Our 
neighborhoods are at a turning point, with the opportunity for some wonderful new and 
redevelopments.  However, the infrastructure must be upgraded to support the plans.
 
For the residents who have not yet met me, by way of introduction, I am a 13 year resident 
of Kaka’ako.  I served as an officer in the US Coast Guard and have managed small 
businesses in Hawaii.   I am a member of the Board of Advisors for the Hawaii Ocean 
Safety Team and in my spare time, I like to play tennis.  I invite you to visit my website:
