Climate Data Services
The Climate Services Branch is on point to coordinate the various tools that are 
provided by NWS and our partners in order to provide
Timely, continuous, reliable climate records
Within the NWS: Manage changes to the NWS Climate Web Pages
With our partners at NCEI, NERCC, SRCC & WRCC
✓ WxCoder provides a means for the NWS Cooperative Observer 
to provide timely, paperless  reporting of observations
✓ IV-ROCS for those observers without internet access to provide 
their observations
✓ NOWData2 provides the NWS Climate Web Pages with the 
most current data from the NWS Cooperative Observers
✓ xmACIS2 provides the local office a robust set of data retrieval 
tools in order to provide localized service to their customers
19
✓ Health of the Network reports to help the WFO identify local
