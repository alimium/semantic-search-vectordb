Massive Detector Paradigms
– Single large volume with multiple horizontal drift 
regions
– Single large volume with single vertical drift region 
followed by multiplication in the gas
– Many (perhaps identical) detectors of the largest 
practical “modest” size with horizontal drift 
regions
• Liquefied Natural Gas tank (FLARE-like)
• Liquefied Natural Gas tank (GLACIER-like)
• Modules (ICARUS-like)
Many large LNG tanks in 
service. excellent safety

and it can still be put in a neutrino beam.
– Although the neutrino beam itself may only be ~10 
microseconds long, the electrons will take ~2 milliseconds to 
drift to the TPC sense wires
– If it can be demonstrated that the cosmic ray background 
can be handled it may be sensible to locate the detector near 
the surface (under a few meters of overburden).
Some uses of Massive LAr Detectors
• One use (of particular interest at Fermilab):
– An excellent electron neutrino detector in a neutrino beam
• Another use:
– A detector under (at least ~50 meters of) dirt/rock cover to 
reduce cosmic ray background
– This allows for nucleon decay, supernovae neutrino watches …

Slide 8
Some Features of Massive LAr Detectors
• Features of modular approach:
– It avoids various problems with large dimension objects
– It does not “put all your eggs in one basket”
– It allows for a staged turn on of data taking
• Light collection is another feature
– Provides a trigger for natural processes such as nucleon 
decay and supernovae … and is very useful for sorting out 
background tracks in detectors in neutrino beams
• Feature of long drift: Purity
– ICARUS has shown it can be done on 300ton scale
– Now it must be done better to be useful for massive scale

• Focus of technical effort Fermilab: “Big Tank” issues
• Using Fermilab’s neutrino beams:
– Proposal to put a ~300liter TPC in front of the MINOS near 
detector (T962) by Yale, Michigan State University and Fermilab
– Conceptual development of a 150ton neutrino detector on the 
surface almost directly above the MINOS near detector.
• Long Baseline study with Brookhaven
– LArTPC physics case studies include using off-axis NuMI beam as 
well as on-axis beam to DUSEL (off-axis = narrow band, on-axis = 
broad band)
• Specific recent study
– Understand the physics reach of a 5kton LArTPC detector near the 
location of NOvA.
• We continue to trade ideas with other groups around the world.

– qualify / disqualify materials to be used in a detector
– The presently preferred TPC design at Fermilab for the 5kton 
detector is the Cellular Design.
– Demonstrate that the purity required by a large liquid argon TPC 
detector can be achieved without evacuation, and estimate the 
associated costs for a 5kton scale detector or larger
– A key is to use argon as a “piston” to push out the air as an 
inexpensive first step (e.g., remove ~ton of oxygen in a 5kton tank)
• Commissioning of the Materials Test Station 
• Purity demonstration without evacuation
• Cellular TPC design
• Systems integration test in a ~30liter TPC (not in this talk)
– Observe cosmic ray tracks
– Develop electronics needed for T962 and other detectors (MSU)
•Purity monitors
– Will make more as needed for the purity demonstration without 
evacuation and other uses.

Test of purging a volume from atmosphere (without evacuation):
Insert Argon gas at bottom of tank over large area at low velocity.
Fewer volume changes than simple mixing requires will achieve a given reduction in air concentration.
The Argon introduced, being heavier than air, will act as a piston and drive the air out of the tank at the top.

•
Demonstrate that the purity required by a large liquid argon TPC
detector can be achieved without evacuation, and estimate the 
associated costs.
•
A credible demonstration must use, as much as possible, the same 
materials and techniques as expected to be used for a massive detector 
(e.g., 5kton).  Thus, the design of the detector must be sufficiently 
understood.
•
The purity demonstration itself does not need a functioning TPC,
but it does need to include the TPC materials arranged as in an 
experiment, and prepared in the same manner as in an 
experiment.
•
The present focus is to propose using a 150ton LNG tank

• purge oxygen to 50ppm or less
• vertical velocity chosen to control diffusion and to be the same as to 
be used in a 5kton detector
• recirculated through filter scaled down from 5kton
• remove water and oxygen, goal is 500ppb
• i. e., achieve purity similar to that achieved by ICARUS with 
evacuation
• Final purity expected to be determined by contaminants from tank
walls, TPC materials, flow restrictions due to presence of TPC, 
leaks, etc.
– Warm argon gas used as a piston
– Recirculation of warm argon gas
– Liquid purification system similar to ICARUS
• Three steps starting from air in the tank:

Slide 28
Cellular Design: An Alternate Wire Layout
(A Better Idea, perhaps)
In the previous design with angled wires, attached to the tank top, 
bottom, and sides, there will be some wires that do not reach all the 
way to the top.  Hence they cannot  easily be read out (without 
electronics immersed in the liquid, for example).
Each set of wire planes has 3 planes to detect electrons drifting in from 
the left, and 3 planes for electrons drifting in from the right.
For each plane in  the left triplet, there is a corresponding plane, with 
the same DC potential, in the right triplet.
Why not …
Connect the short wires on the left, that did not reach the top, to the 
set of short wires on the right that start not at the tank bottom, but 
higher up on the wall.
Voila:   Complete coverage.

1. Panels are made off-site and shipped (by truck or cargo 
plane) to the detector site
2. Panels are made while the tank is being built
3. Panels are fully tested and cold-shocked
4. Panel installation is fast and low-risk
The panel is tall enough to reach the top of the Argon pool.
Interpret the previous cross section as that of a panel that 
forms a “cell” just 3 m wide.
Since a single wire wraps around the cell from the left side to 
right side, this introduces pattern recognition complications.
What do we gain ?

A     5 ton detector is a cylinder 5 meters high with diameter 1 meter. 
A 150 ton detector is a cylinder 5 meters high with diameter 5 meters.
A   5 kton detector is a cylinder 17 meters high with diameter 17 meters
The transverse dimension is partly modular - more panels, similar drift distances; 
If the 150 ton detector works, the design of the 17 meter panel is probably 
the key technical challenge.
