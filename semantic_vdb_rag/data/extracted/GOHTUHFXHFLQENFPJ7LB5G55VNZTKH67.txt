Native villages; continued use
of self-identification to obtain
information on race; a greater
propensity in 1990 than in ear-
lier censuses for individuals
(especially those of mixed In-
dian and non-Indian parent-
age) to report themselves as
American Indian; and im-
proved outreach programs
and promotion campaigns.
Thirty-nine percent of the
American Indian population
was under 20 years old in
1990, compared with 29 per-
cent of the Nation’s total popu-
lation.   The median age in
1990 of the American Indian
population was 26 years, con-
siderably younger than the
U.S. median age of 33 years.
The comparable median ages
in 1980 were 23 years and 
30 years, respectively.  The
American Indian population 
is younger in part because 
of higher fertility rates than 
the total population.
Nearly two-thirds of 
American Indian families are
married-coupled families.
The American Indian, 
Eskimo, and Aleut 
population has grown 
rapidly since 1970.
In the last two decades, the
American Indian, Eskimo, and
Aleut population grew rapidly.
In 1970, this population num-
bered 827,000; it reached 
1.4 million in 1980 and nearly
2 million in 1990.  The 1990
census counted 1,878,285
American Indians, 57,152 
Eskimos, and 23,797 Aleuts.
Census Bureau estimates and
projections suggest that on
July 1, 1994, the American In-
dian, Eskimo, and Aleut popu-
lation numbered 2.2 million,
and that it will reach 4.3 million
and just over 1 percent of the
population by 2050.
The 72 percent increase 
between the 1970 and 1980
censuses and the 38 percent
increase between the 1980
and 1990 censuses cannot be
attributed only to natural 
increase.  Other factors that
may have contributed to the
higher count of American In-
dians1 include  improvements
in the question on race;

About 6 in 10 of the Nation’s
442,000 American Indian 
families were married-couple
families in 1990, compared
with about 8 in 10 of the 
Nation’s 64.5 million families.

Indian husband and wife 
Nearly one-half of the 
American Indian population
lives west of the Mississippi
River.
Nearly one-half of the Ameri-
can Indian population lived in
the West in 1990, 29 percent
in the South, 17 percent in the
Midwest, and 6 percent in the
Northeast.  Between 1980 and
1990, the proportion of Ameri-
can Indians increased notice-
ably only in the South, from 26
to 29 percent.  In 1990, four
States had an American In-
dian population over 100,000
— Oklahoma, California, Ari-
zona, and New Mexico.  The
population in these four States
comprised 42 percent of the
total U.S. American Indian
population.  Oklahoma was
the State with the largest
American Indian population in
1990, climbing from second

trust lands were high school
graduates or more.  Among
the 10 largest reservations
and trust lands, this proportion
ranged considerably.  Black-
feet (66 percent) and Hopi 
(63 percent) had similar
proportions of high school
graduates.  Gila River, at
about 37 percent, had the 
lowest proportion who had 
at least graduated from high
school, followed by Navajo
with 41 percent.
families was 71 percent in
1980, compared with 82 per-
cent of all husband and wife
families.  Consistent with the
national trend, the proportion
of American Indian families
maintained by a female
householder with no husband
present increased during the
last decade and reached 27
percent in 1990.  This propor-
tion was considerably larger
than the national figure of 
17 percent.
The number of 
American Indians living on 
reservations and trust lands
varied considerably.
Of the 314 reservations and
trust lands identified for the
1990 census, only the Navajo
Reservation and Trust Lands
located in Arizona, New Mexi-
co, and Utah had more than
100,000 American Indians —
143,405 lived there.
An additional nine reservations
had more than 7,000 Ameri-
can Indians in 1990:  Pine
Ridge, NE-SD (11,182); Fort
Apache, AZ (9,825); Gila Riv-
er, AZ (9,116); Papago, AZ
(8,480); Rosebud, SD (8,043);
San Carlos, AZ (7,110); Zuni
Pueblo, AZ-NM (7,073); Hopi,
AZ (7,061); and Blackfeet, MT
(7,025).  The 218,320 Ameri-
can Indians living on these 
10 reservations and trust
lands accounted for about half
of all American Indians 
living on reservations and 
trust lands.
More American Indian 
families and persons were
in poverty, compared with
all families and persons.
Between 1979 and 1989, 
the poverty rate increased for
both  American Indian families
and persons.2  Twenty-seven
percent of American Indian
families were poor in 1989,
compared with 24 percent in
1979.  This compared with a
poverty rate of 10 percent for
all families in both 1989 and
1979.  In 1989, 50 percent 
of American Indian families
maintained by females with 
no husband present were
poor, compared with 31 per-
cent of all families maintained
by women with no husband 
present.
The 1980 and 1990 censuses
show that the poverty rate 
for American Indians has 
remained considerably higher
than that of the total popula-
tion.  In 1989, 31 percent of
American Indian persons lived
below the poverty level, up
from 27 percent in 1979.  The
national poverty rate was

has improved significantly.
In 1990, 66 percent of the
1,080,000 American Indians
25 years old and over were
high school graduates or high-
er, compared with only 56 per-
cent in 1980.  Despite the 
advances, the 1990 proportion
was still below that for the total
population (75 percent).
American Indians were also
less likely than the entire U.S.
population to have completed
a bachelor’s degree or higher.
About 9 percent of American
Indians completed a bache-
lor’s degree or higher in 1990,
compared with 8 percent in
1980 — still lower than the 20
percent for the total population
in 1990.
American Indians on 
reservations and trust lands
had low per capita incomes.
The per capita income in 1989
was about $4,478 for Ameri-
can Indians residing on all 
reservations and trust lands,
compared with $8,328 for all
American Indians.  The per
capita income of American In-
dians on the 10 largest reser-
vations ranged from about
$3,100 on the Papago and
Pine Ridge Reservations to
over $4,500 on the Blackfeet
($4,718) and Hopi ($4,566)
Reservations.
NOTE:  The most recent data
for the American Indian popu-
lation are from the 1990 cen-
sus.  The Current Population
Survey is not sufficiently large
to provide reliable estimates
for this population.
