*  Distribution maps show the counties where a species is known to occur in one of its priority areas, as well as the counties 
where a species is likely to occur in one of its priority areas due to the presence of suitable habitat.  Counties that are part of the
recovery area for Threatened and Endangered species are also shown as part of a species distribution. Occurrences of a
species in other counties are possible as new information becomes available, and maps will be updated as necessary at the
beginning of each calendar year. The date shown in the footer identifies when the last update was made to maps found on this page.
