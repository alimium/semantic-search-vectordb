4A 
Adjusting Transitional Yields For High-Risk Land  
 
To reduce the frequency of excessive indemnities in high-risk areas, RMA may 
adjust transitional yields (T-Yields) by using T-Yield Map Areas or other actuarial 
document, to more accurately reflect an average yield for the area.  The T-Yields 
in the database are also subject to change.  Refer to the Crop Insurance 
Handbook (CIH) for more information on T-Yields.  
 
A(1) 
Identify areas of high-risk land on the FCI-33, FCI-33 Legal Descriptor 
Document or FCI-33 Supplement. Use Natural Resource Conservation 
Service (NRCS) soils surveys, climatological data, insurance experience, 
RMA RO site inspections, and local resource personnel to determine the 
presence of high-risk land. 
 
 
 
A(2) 
Determine the adjusted “T- Yield” for a high-risk area: 
 
(2)(a) Calculation.  Divide the weighted average yield potential of 
predominant soil-mapping units in the high-risk area (High-Risk 
Yield [HRY]), by the weighted average yield for the predominant 
soils of the cropland in the entire county (County Average Yield 
[CAY]), excluding any high-risk land.  HRY/CAY = Yield Factor (F). 
 
(2)(b) Determine the County Transitional Yield (T-Yield by 
practice/type/map area) from the county actuarial documents.  
Multiply the County T-Yield by Yield Factor (F) to obtain the 
adjusted T-Yield for the high-risk area.  See [Exhibit 1]. 
 
 
 
A(3) 
Determine the adjusted T-Yield for flood prone/excess moisture areas: 
 
 
Yields published by NRCS do not account for probable losses due to 
recurring problems with flooding and excess moisture; the following can 
be used to determine an adjusted T-Yield: 
 
(3)(a) Determine the County T-Yield (by practice/type/map area) from 
the county actuarial documents. 
 
(3)(b) Compute the flood/excess moisture frequency.  Subtract the 
flood/excess moisture frequency from 1.00.  Multiply the result 
times the County T-Yield.  This will be the adjusted T-Yield for the 
flood-prone/excess moisture land.   
 
A(4) 
Soils with no published yields (contact NRCS for updated or 
unpublished lists) may be ranked by using methods such as yield 
potential versus available water, comparability with other similar soils, 
adjustments for slope, salinity, etc., and interactions of these 
characteristics. Other sources of supporting information include 
climatological data, actual yield history, geographic information system 
mapping, university personnel and reports, NRCS and FSA personnel. 
 
NOTE:  Determination of adjusted T-Yields for high-risk land should be 
thoroughly documented and retained in the county work folder.

Master Yields 
 
B(1) 
Approving County Crop Programs For Master Yields 
 
Use the following standards to recommend county crop programs for 
master yields: 
 
(1)(a) Agronomic practices generally preclude the accumulation of a 
complete four years of production history in a ten-year calendar 
period for a unit. 
 
(1)(b) Unbiased third-party evidence of planted acreage and harvested 
production (supporting evidence) is available through a processor 
or the insured. 
 
(1)(c) The occurrence of a large number of policies for the crop and 
predominance of crop share (vs. cash rent/ownership) may cause 
administrative problems with an operator entity master yield, 
because sharing landowners may be insured with a different 
company.  NOTE:  Added land procedures for standard APH will 
not apply to a crop in a county eligible for master yields.  If the 
crop has not been produced for four years or more, producers 
would not be eligible for master yields and will be limited to 
variable or 100% T-Yields.   
 
(1)(d) Master yields are applicable on a county crop program basis.  
Different Master yields may be established for areas with similar 
growing conditions. This is referred to as the master yield 
homogenous area. 
 
(1)(e) Submit recommended changes to the Master Yield List in Exhibit 
7 of the CIH by crop and state or by county crop program to the 
Product Development Division no later than COB on the first of 
March each calendar year.   
 
 
B(2) 
Determining Homogeneous Master Yield Areas 
 
(2)(a)  Considerations when determining a homogeneous master yield 
area include: 
 
 
1 Soil type and yield potential; 
 
 
2 Rainfall and climatic conditions; 
 
 
3 Farming practices and management; 
 
 
4 Loss experience; 
 
 
5 Actuarial maps; and  
 
 
 
6 Farm Serial Numbers (FSN) or legal descriptions.

AUGUST 2003 
 
FCIC 24010 
 
B(3) 
Hard-Copy Evidence For Master Yields 
 
 
 
 
For cases where the RMA RO determines the approved APH yield, the 
RMA RO may require hard-copy evidence of production when reported 
yields do not appear reasonable. 
 
(3)(a) Reasonable means: The reported yield is greater than the result 
of multiplying the applicable lower level yield edit factor for annual 
crops contained in the Data Acceptance System (DAS) manual 
times  the transitional yield for the practice/type for the county or 
area within a county. 
 
 
 
(3)(b) Send a letter to the Insurance Provider (IP) describing the 
required hard-copy evidence.  Remind the company/agent that 
RMA RO will assign a yield if the required evidence is not returned 
within 20 calendar days from the date of notification from the RMA 
RO. 
 
 
 
B(4) 
Transfer Of APH Yield History For Master Yields 
 
(4)(a) In some cases, an insured with a master yield may expand the 
farming operation across a county or state line or form a new 
entity.  When this occurs, the published Transitional Yield may not 
be appropriate.  The RMA RO may determine a yield (F Yield 
Descriptor) to be used in place of the published Transitional Yield 
until four years of production history can be accumulated.  Upon 
receipt of a timely filed Request For Actuarial Change (as defined 
in the CIH), the RMA RO may consider determining a yield for the 
following cases: 
 
 
1 Producers who have a master yield in a county and expand 
their operation into an adjacent county that has similar yield 
expectations. 
 
 
2 Individuals who participate in the creation of a master yield 
credited to another person (New Entity) must have participated 
in management of the crop for at least four years.  In addition, 
the RMA RO must determine that a reasonable expectation of 
similar production from this new entity exists in order to issue 
an RO Determined Yield.  If the entity change qualifies for 
successor-in-interest, a total transfer of the database would be 
used.  Refer to Section 4 in the CIH. 
 
 
(4)(b) RMA RO Determined Yields 
 
1 MAP AREAS:  This procedure may apply to counties that have 
map areas if the Transitional Yield in the map area in the 
county expanded into is within 15 percent of the Transitional 
Yield in the map area of the existing county.  The RO 
Determined Yield will be reduced by the ratio of the 
Transitional Yields, but will not be increased above the actual 
yields.  No RO Determined Yields are authorized between 
map areas within a county.

AUGUST 2003 
 
FCIC 24010 
 
 
2 RO’s may determine and issue a reasonable yield to be used 
in place of the Transitional Yield until four years of actual 
yields can be accumulated.  Reasonable yields may be 
determined by: 
 
 
a Using NRCS soil survey yields by soil-mapping unit to 
establish relationships between acreage. 
 
b Indexing yields using the ratio of Transitional Yields or 
processor averages between Transitional Yield areas, 
types, practices, or varieties.  The RO Determined Yield 
will not exceed the actual yields obtained by the original 
entity or adjacent county. 
 
3 The RMA RO will establish the RO Determined Yield and 
issue it in a letter to the company instructing them to use the 
yield in the master yield Database(s) with an “F” descriptor and 
to keep the letter in the producer’s file until four years of actual 
history is accumulated on the master yield(s). 
 
 
4C 
Perennial Crop Underwriting Guidelines  
 
 
Submit proposed guidelines or updates to existing guidelines to the Product 
Development Division for approval.  Existing guidelines will apply unless changes 
are submitted for approval prior to the yield determination process for the crop 
year. 
 
C(1) 
Each RMA RO will establish underwriting guidelines to determine yield 
adjustments when needed.  Consider the following criteria when 
developing these guidelines: 
 
(1)(a) The use of inspection reports which indicate the condition of the 
crop, cultural practices, level of management, etc. 
 
(1)(b) The use of insured's yield history. 
 
(1)(c) History of previous insureds. 
 
(1)(d) Variations in base yield for each crop within states and between 
states. 
 
(1)(e) Current growth stage. 
 
(1)(f) Orchard density and tree spacing. 
 
(1)(g) Tree/vine/bush variety (cultivar) by block or unit. 
 
(1)(h) Degree of carryover damage (disease, freeze, etc.). 
 
(1)(i) 
Outside sources of underwriting information such as university 
extension specialists, etc.

C(2) 
Guideline Preparation  
 
(2)(a) Format office underwriting guidelines as shown in [Exhibit 2].   
 
(2)(b) Use the BACKGROUND statement to define the problem being 
addressed.   
 
(2)(c) Use the DETERMINATION portion of the guidelines to convey  
a concise decision statement.   
 
(2)(d) Use the IMPLEMENTATION section to define office procedures. 
 
 
C(3) 
Regional Offices are authorized in the Crop Insurance Handbook to 
issue guidelines, which waive pre-acceptance field inspections for 
certain situations (e.g., abnormally low yields from insurable causes(s) of 
loss for a given area may cause the yield variance to require field reviews 
of an excessive number of contracts). 
 
(3)(a) Waiving pre-acceptance field inspection.  As per the CIH, 
Insurance Providers are not required to perform field inspections, 
based on the yield variance (as amended by RMA RO guidelines), 
on more than 10 percent of their Category C APH contracts per 
crop, per region.  The RMA RO is authorized to issue additional 
guidelines/criteria identifying which contracts (by crop, by region) 
are to be selected under the 10 percent limitation.   
 
 
(3)(b) Pre-Acceptance Perennial Crop Inspections 
 
 
The CIH also states that the ”Insurance Providers should contact 
the applicable RMA RO and specify the reason, which may cause 
excessive pre-acceptance field inspections, and provide 
examples, which clearly indicate that excessive pre-acceptance 
field inspections would be required.” 
 
 
RMA RO may issue guidelines that waive making Pre-Acceptance 
Perennial Crop Inspection Reports if more than 10 percent of a 
companies Category C Crop policies by crop, by region will be 
selected under the Yield Variance in CIH Section 7 F(2)(b)1&2. 
 
1 Regional guidelines should only address the policies that 
should be reviewed under this 10 percent rule (e.g., When 
selecting policies, priority should be given first to polices 
selected for yield variance with Pre-Acceptance Perennial 
Inspections Reports that are greater than five years old).  
 
2 Copies of the RO guidelines/criteria identifying which 
contracts by crop by region are to be selected, under the 
10 percent rule for completing Pre-Acceptance Perennial 
Inspections Reports due to yield variance, must be 
submitted to the Product Development Division, 
Underwriting Standards Branch for approval, prior to being 
issued.  RMA RO’s are not authorized to waive doing any 
inspections reports for these contracts or any other CIH

procedure. Once approved by RMA RD/PDD/UD 
guidelines should be made available electronically on the 
Regional Office Websites, at the same time they are 
issued. 
 
(3)(c) RO Determined Yields 
 
 
The RMA RO may issue guidelines to Insurance Providers 
authorizing them to calculate approved APH yields for cases 
where RMA RO determinations would otherwise be required.  In 
these cases forwarding of the documentation to the RMA RO 
would not be required.  As per CIH Section 7F(3)(b)3, Insurance 
Providers are required to send a list of these policies to the RMA 
RO for spot check purposes.   
 
 
Copies of the RMA RO underwriting guidelines, with instructions 
for calculating yields and doing yield substitutions under the yield 
adjustment election, must be submitted to the Product 
Development Division/Underwriting Standards Branch for 
approval.  Once approved by RMA RD/PDD/UD guidelines should 
be made available electronically on the Regional Office Websites, 
at the same time they are issued. 
 
1 The RMA RO should be cautious in issuing any guidelines to 
address catastrophic years that would alter adjustments for 
alternate bearing or down trending identified by the present 
yield variance contained in CIH procedure.  The RMA RO’s 
may not waive CIH procedures preventing CUPS, to apply, to 
contracts selected for special cases or RO Determined Yields.  
See [3d) below] for Yield Substitutions. 
 
2 The RMA RO should spot-check and/or review approved APH 
yields completed by an Insurance Provider authorized to under 
RMA RO guidelines for Perennial Category C Crops.   
 
a RMA RO Determined Yield Request with Pre-Acceptance 
Perennial Crop Inspections, less than five years old 
(unless documentation following procedure to waive based 
upon the 10% rule), and all other required supporting 
documentation, should be reviewed to determine 
compliance with RMA policy, procedure and guidelines. 
 
b The RMA RO guidelines will provide instructions for 
selecting policies for spot check and/or review.  A minimum 
of one policy by crop by insurance provider by state must 
be pulled for spot check or review.     
 
3(d) 
Yield Limitations and Adjustments 
 
1 The actual yields, prior to any substitution under the yield 
adjustment election, are used for determining if any yield 
adjustments may be required. 
 
9 
 
AUGUST 2003 
 
FCIC 24010 
 
As per CIH Section 7 J(6)(a) Yield limitations (CUPS) do not 
apply to policies identified as special cases.  
 
a Special cases are identified in the CIH Section 7F(2), yield 
substitutions for these policies are determined by RMA 
RO’s. 
 
i 
CIH Section 7(2)(b) 1 & 2. 
 
aa CIH Section 13 D(7)(a)2 a, yield substitutions (60% 
of T-Yield) will not be made for low yields occurring 
due to alternate bearing years such as policies 
identified by CIH Sec. 7(2)(b)1.  
 
bb CIH Section 13 D(7)(a)2 b, yield substitutions will 
not be made for low yields occurring due to yields 
declining, such as policies identified in Section 7 
F(2)(b)2. 
 
ii  CIH Section 7(2)(c), productivity is reduced due to 
disease, damage has occurred or cultural practices 
have been performed that will reduce the insured crop 
from previous production levels or answered yes to 
Question #22 on the Producer’s Pre-Acceptance 
Worksheet.  Acreage that is in poor condition, being 
renovated, grafted, or reduced tonnage contracts, etc., 
such as policies identified in Section 7 F(2)(c).  
 
iii CIH Section 7(2)(e), irrigation water supply is not 
adequate such as policies identified under Section 7 F 
(2)(e). 
 
iiii CIH Section 7(2)(f), unusual cases submitted to the 
RMA RO, policies identified under Section 7 F(2)(f) 
(e.g. contracts with young acreage, prior to 2001, 
where 60% T-Yield substitutions may be greater than 
the acreage is capable of producing).  
 
b Requests for greater yields than the average yield are for 
policies not identified as special cases. 
 
i 
Policies identified as special cases, requesting the 
RMA RO to establish higher yields after approved 
yields are issued, must be submitted under 
reconsideration criteria (within 30 days of issuance of 
the approved yield). 
    
2 RO Guidelines Examples:  
 
a If the RMA RO identifies in their guidelines that the Yield 
Variance Table in Section 7 F(2)(b)1 of the CIH will be 
used to determine alternate bearing for a crop such as 
apples.  The RMA RO may have a tolerance test for 
policies that are selected by this table, prior to doing any 
yield substitutions.  They may issue guidelines such as the 
most recent crop year’s yield is equal to or greater than 
125 percent of the APH average yield and the prior year’s  
 
10 
 
AUGUST 2003 
 
FCIC 24010 
 
average yield is 75 percent or less than the APH average 
yield.  For these policies adjustments will by made using 
the average of the years in the database could be 
multiplied by 0.5 and the average of the two lowest yields 
multiplied by 0.5 and sum the results to obtain the RO 
Determined Yield.   Units selected that are identified as 
alternate bearing would not qualify for the 60% yield 
substitution or CUPS based upon the CIH procedures. 
 
However, contracts selected by this criteria, that the RMA 
RO identifies as not having alternate bearing, may have 
low yields that qualify for the 60% T-Yield substitutions.  
 
b Using the yield variance in Section 7 F(2)(b)2, policies 
selected by this criteria are also determined prior to doing 
any yield substitution.  The RMA RO guidelines may 
indicate that adjustments for policies selected where the 
most recent three years average is 25 percent less than 
the APH average yield (prior to any yield substitution) 
should by limited to 80% of the prior three year average. 
 
As per CIH procedure the 60% T-Yield substitutions are 
determined by the Corporation not to be appropriate for 
qualifying years, and CUPS will not apply for these units.  
Contracts selected by this criteria, that the RMA RO 
identifies as not having yield declines may qualify for the 
60% T-Yield substitutions for qualifying low yields.     
 
c 
If the unit had been selected because productivity had 
been reduced, the yield substitution may be used prior to 
adjustment only for insurable causes such as disease and 
hail.  However, if cultural practices were to limit production, 
such as a reduced tonnage contract, or grafting, removal of 
trees/vines/bushes, the approved yield will be limited to the 
terms of the contract, condition of the acreage or policy 
provisions on insurability.  
 
NOTE: These provisions and any guidelines the RO may issue or follow cannot 
change or waive procedures in the Crop Insurance Handbook or 
provisions of any Policy.

Tobacco Producers  Except Tobacco type 31; 41 & 32 PA; 51 & 61 CT; 51 &61 
MA; and 32 MD).  Refer to the CIH for additional information. 
 
D(1) As provided in the Crop Insurance Handbook, insureds are not 
required to report yield history on an APH form.  Producers report yield 
history to the USDA/Farm Service Agency (FSA) County offices.  RMA 
obtains this producer data from FSA, processes the data into county 
producer classifications, see [Exhibit 5] and publishes these classifications 
in County FCI-32 (Producer) Actuarial Classification Listings, hereafter 
referred as listings.  Producer insurance coverage and guarantees are

Producer classifications are updated annually using FSA’s most 
recent ten (10) year history of county planted acreage and production.  
This ten year history is referred to by RMA as the base period.  Due to the 
timing of data availability from FSA to RMA’s filing schedule, there is a 
one-year lag applicable for the listings.  (Example: Crop year 2004 listings 
are based upon 1993-2002 planting history.) 
 
(2)(a) If the producer has ten years of actual yields, total all production 
and acreage from all farms for each of the ten years in the base 
period.  Divide production by acreage for each year to  
 
derive a weighted average by year.  Drop the high and low yields 
and divide by eight for the product average. 
 
(2)(b) If the producer has three to nine years of actual yields in the base 
period, determine the weighted average yield for each year by 
dividing total production by total acreage from all farms for each of  
 
the producer’s planted years.  Sum the weighted average yields 
and divide by the sum of the county average NASS yields for the 
same years to determine an index.  A proxy yield for each non- 
planted year will be determined by multiplying the county average 
NASS yield for that year by the index.  The high and low year 
yields will be dropped and the simple average determined for the 
remaining year(s) yield(s). 
 
(2)(c) If the producer has two years of actual yields in the base period, 
determine the weighted average yield for each year by dividing 
total production by total acreage from all farms for each of the 
producer’s planted years.  Sum the weighted average yields and 
divide by the sum of the county average NASS yields for the same 
years to determine an index.  The index will be cupped at .60 and 
capped at .95.  A proxy yield for each non-planted year will be 
determined by multiplying the county average NASS yield for that 
year by the index. Determine the simple average for the ten years.  
 
(2)(d) If the producer has one year of actual yield in the base period, 
determine a proxy yield for the missing nine years by multiplying 
the county average NASS yield for each year by .80.  Determine 
the simple average for the ten years.

FCI-32 Actuarial Classification Listing Rules Page will provide rules 
that govern the producer classifications published in the listings.  RMA 
RO’s are authorized to define the rules that govern producer 
classifications in their regions.  
  
D(4) 
RMA RO’s are authorized to establish classifications by farm serial 
number based on the risk associated with the land.  The Farm Serial 
Number (FSN) listing on the last page(s) of the FCI-32 provides 
classifications for farms for which limits will be imposed.  The primary 
reason for limiting a farm classification would be where the producer has 
similar yields on most farms, except one or two.  The exceptional farms 
generally have yields that are considerably lower than those of other 
farms.  This situation possibly indicates severe problems with this land; 
therefore, lower yields.  It may be advisable to limit the amount of 
coverage assigned to this land.  FSN classifications reflect land risk only.

4E 
Added Land Discretion   
 
 
Beginning with the 2003 crop year, discretion was granted to the RMA RO’s to 
consider factors other than the land productivity when reviewing added land 
request.  Examples of cases or other factors to consider is when yields used to 
determine the Simple Average (SA) T-Yield are from small acreages.  In such 
cases, the RMA RO’s may authorize use of a variable T-Yield rather than a SA T-
Yield. 
  
 
Added land requests are submitted to RMA RO’s for cases where added land 
exceeds the acreage thresholds.  See the CIH, Exhibit 36, for thresholds.  The 
RMA RO’s will review requests to determine if use of SA T-Yields is appropriate.   
 
 
Following is an outline to determine if authorization of SA T-Yields is appropriate, 
for requests exceeding thresholds shown in the CIH, that require RMA RO 
review.  The goal of RMA RO reviews is to determine that: 
 
E(1) 
The added land has similar characteristics as the existing land, 
currently in the operation, that would indicate productivity falls within 15% 
of the existing land. 
 
 
 
(1)(a) Soil survey yield data and maps showing soil types are used to 
compare, or climate or elevation data may also be used to 
determine similar agronomic conditions. 
 
 
 
(2)(b) The actual production history for the crop by P/T/V on the added 
land for the previous crop year(s) from the previous  
 
 
operator/tenant and submitted by the insured, may be used for 
this comparison. 
 
 
 
E(2) 
The actual yields reported from the existing land in the operation, 
being used to determine the SA T-Yield, are credible and represent 
sufficient acreage to provide a reliable source to base yields for the added 
land. 
 
For instance, if it appears average yields used to determine the SA T-
Yield contains “yield builders” such as small amounts of acreage 
compared to the amount of land being added or the data base for the  
 
13 
 
AUGUST 2003 
 
FCIC 24010 
 
existing unit has acreage going from small to large and these yields 
exceed T-Yields, the average yield may be reduced to determine use of 
the SA T-Yield. 
 
 
 
 
(2)(a) The simple average yield for the basic unit can be recalculated to 
determine if the recalculated yield is within 15% of standard 
(unadjusted) SA T-Yield. 
  
1 Compute the weighted average of all qualifying units in the 
basic unit and T-Yield areas to eliminate any problems with 
small acreage and high yields. 
 
 
 
 
2 Remove the high yields for small acreage, if there are no other 
similar units with acreage for the year.  If the added land has 
equal productivity to the existing land, (based upon soil types, 
etc.,) but the recalculated yield is less than 85% of the 
standard SA T-Yield that would be applied by added land 
procedure, the RMA RO would determine that the variable T-
Yield is appropriate for the request.

HIGH RISK LAND RATE CLASSIFICATION 
 
 
5A 
Flood.  Each river and its flood plain represent complex interaction between 
hydrology, topography, crop physiology, weather, soils, and the effects of human 
intervention, see [Exhibit 3].   
 
Flood is a random predictable peril affecting identifiable locations and 
representing a definable risk that is in addition to the standard insurance risk for 
the crop and county.  (Recurrent frequency of the event within a locality is 
observable and measurable.)  These unique characteristics dictate a separate 
accounting for the risk within an actuarial structure of an insurance product.  This 
segregation of risk is typical for all crop, property, and personal liability products 
offering flood insurance. 
 
A(1) 
Rating Flood Prone Land.  
 
(1)(a) Rate flood prone land based on the extent, frequency, and 
severity of loss.  The determined premium rate (additive, 
multiplicative, or fixed) that corresponds with a classification 
assignment on the FCI-33 will be listed on the FCI-35, Coverage 
and Rates table.  Premium rates or rate area classifications may 
also be identified on the FCI-33 Legal Descriptor or FCI-33.  More 
than one rated area may be identified on these actuarial 
documents if the county has multiple river, streams, or 
watersheds; if crops are grown between the river and a levee, or 
the risk of flood varies within the same location (e.g., changes in 
elevation). 
 
(2)(b) Rating for flood requires consideration of the crop, the extent of 
potential flooding, flood severity, and frequency of occurrence.  
Determine the minimum flood stage or elevation that will be used 
to determine flood frequency.  A premium rate may be calculated  
for an area using river gage stations along the river or from a 
comparable watershed.  Readings should be obtained for at least 
the most recent 20-year period that data are available.   
 
A(2) 
Determining extent, frequency, and severity.  
 
(2)(a) Isolating the extent of flood risk is the process of identifying land 
directly and indirectly affected by flooding.  A direct impact would 
be on unprotected land adjacent to the river.  Resulting damage 
would be immediate and obvious.  An indirect impact may be on 
acreage behind a levee that is vulnerable to seepage, 
overtopping, levee breach, high water table, or poor drainage.  
The extent of potential flooding is influenced by elevation, flood 
magnitude, topography, presence and amount of natural 
vegetation during the year, watershed size, flood control  
measures, and artificial drainage.  Flood zone maps produced by 
other governmental entities, topography maps, soil surveys, direct 
physical observation, aerial photography, etc., may be used to 
determine the extent of flood risk.  Use the FCI-33 to show 
determined high-risk area boundaries. 
 
15 
 
AUGUST 2003 
 
FCIC 24010 
 
(2)(b) Determining frequency consists of tabulating how often, when, 
and the duration of flooding.  There are many possible flood 
magnitudes; hence, many possible elevations affected within a 
flood plain.  Duration and timing also have significant influence.  
Short duration flooding late in the growing season may produce 
negligible damage to a particular crop.  The same type of flood 
experienced during mid-season may cause total loss.  The 
opposite results may be produced when a different crop is 
planted.   
 
1 Determining the frequency and severity of crop loss from a 
historical flood depends on gaining an idea of: 
 
a When it occurred during the year. 
 
b The depth of the water. 
 
c 
The size of the area affected. 
 
d How fast the water moved. 
 
e How quickly the water receded. 
 
2 In addition to these historical observations, unique 
characteristics of each crop and the applicable insurance 
program must be considered: 
 
a When the crop is normally planted. 
 
b How high the crop grows. 
 
c 
At what point(s) during the growing season is the crop 
more or less susceptible to flood damage. 
 
d What features of the insurance product mitigate or 
enhance the potential for indemnification. 
 
3 
Example considerations: 
 
A major flood in the Midwest in early March has no 
effect on the probability or severity of a corn loss 
because the crop is not normally planted. 
 
The effects of a slow moving, shallow flood that 
recedes reasonably quickly during early September 
will be negligible effects on corn, but catastrophic to 
soybeans.   
 
A late April flood that drains away quickly may produce 
a corn replanting payment, but is not likely to result in a 
total loss unless soil type drainage limitations or 
continued rainfall prevent replanting the crop. 
 
16 
 
AUGUST 2003 
 
FCIC 24010 
 
(2)(c) Determining loss severity involves identifying the percentage of 
crop loss associated with each historical flood when data are 
available.  Flood is usually catastrophic to a growing plant. 
It does not gradually reduce a plant's ability to produce (such as 
drought). The plant is most often simply eliminated.  However, 
consideration to overall loss within an area must be given when 
evaluating each event.  For example, an early season flood may 
result in replanting or delayed planting of the crop.  Final yields 
may be unaffected or reduced.  A crop planted later than normal 
due to flooding is younger and more vulnerable to stress from 
drier summer conditions than a timely planted crop.  The resulting 
cause of loss may be drought although the initial contributing 
factor was flood.   
 
Develop a flood severity scale for each crop.  Apply the scale 
whenever the river exceeds flood stage or a point where crop 
damage may occur.  This flood severity scale should  
account for the time of the flood and the expected yield loss.  
Early season flooding causes delayed planting or replanting of the 
crop without severely limiting crop potential.  While floods 
occurring near the final planting dates and later are often 
catastrophic.  An example of a severity table ranking the 
significance of each historical event may look like the following:

A(3) 
Evaluating flood gage peak flow discharge verses daily flow 
discharge rates.   
 
(3)(a) When evaluating peak and daily flow discharges, a difference will 
be seen between the cubic flow amounts recorded in each data 
set.  A block of data may look like this: 
 
Date             Peak Flow Discharge           Daily Flow Discharge 
 
1979.04.12            19700                                      17300 
1996.05.08            13000                                        7280 
1993.09.23              8820                                        6340 
              
(3)(b) The peak flow discharge is the instantaneous discharge for the 
highest gage height recorded for that day (or period).  Gage height 
is measured usually every 15 minutes, although some programs 
have a variable time recording of gage height.  The highest gage 
height reached is used to compute the peak discharge.   
 
(3)(c) The daily flow discharge is the average sum of the discharges 
obtained from the daily gage height readings.  This is why the 
peak flow is higher than the average flow. 
 
(3)(d) These differences have several ramifications on flood rating. 
 
17 
 
AUGUST 2003 
 
FCIC 24010 
 
1 When performing flood event analysis, recognize that a daily 
flow discharge has affected more or less of the flood plain on 
that day than the daily average or mean alone. 
 
2 A large variation between peak and daily average flow may 
suggest: 
 
a Faster moving water and quicker plant destruction. 
 
b Presence and effect from flood abatement measures. 
 
c 
Possible water release or diversion from man-made flood 
control structures. 
 
d Flood damage between levees and the river may be more 
immediate and more severe than on an unprotected river.   
 
A(4) 
Determining Flood Peril Premium Rates. 
 
(4)(a) Apply the appropriate weight for each time the river was above 
flood stage.  The loss severity weight for any single year cannot 
exceed 1.00 since this denotes a total loss.  Total the weights 
assigned and divide by 20 (number of years of flood data).  The 
result is the risk-rate for flood.  Refer to Section 5 C for additional 
rate calculation instructions.  
 
(4)(b) This system works well when flood-history data are available.  
When data is not available, the RO must utilize other sources of 
information such as the NCRS Soil Survey Report Field Reviews 
during seasons of flooding, the county soil surveys aerial 
photography, topographic maps, and personal interviews within 
the county to evaluate the flood risk. 
 
 
5B 
Rating of Fragile and Highly Erodible Land.  
 
 
 
B(1) 
Land with inherent risk factors such as low water holding capacity, 
excess water runoff, salinity, alkalinity, etc., will be rated based on known 
rates for comparable land in a similar climate.  The rate that corresponds 
with a classification assignment on the FCI-33 will be shown on the FCI-
35 as a fixed, add on, or multiplicative rate. 
 
 
 
B(2) 
Establish a rate based on a county having similar characteristics, or 
in which the soil, climate topography, etc., of the land in question is 
within normal variation for the county.  In some cases, rates could be 
determined from individual insurance experience versus the county for 
the same crop years after conversion to the same coverage level and on 
a yield (free from the effects of revenue products) only basis. 
 
 
 
B(3) 
Methods to establish new rate areas, to aid in reviewing prior high-risk 
rate areas, and determining a rate for a written agreement: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
18 
 
AUGUST 2003 
 
FCIC 24010 
 
 
 
 
(3)(a) Determine rate from a known area.  Once an area of similar 
characteristics is found, calculate the rate for that area using the 
expected yield for the new rate area.  Divide this rate by the rate 
at that same yield in the county in which the new rate area will be 
established.  Adjustments in yields and rates may need to be 
made based on differences in climate or soils between the area of 
known rates and the new rate area.  (If the result is less than 1.2 
(20% difference), do not establish the high rate area for that crop 
or consider removing an existing high rate area. 
 
 
 
 
(3)(b) Determine rate from producer experience.  This may be practical 
to do in areas with few producers and verifiable insurance 
participation within the proposed high rate area.  Determine who is 
insured in the proposed high rate area.  Normalize producer and 
county insurance experience for the same years to a common 
coverage level and on the basis of yield only (free from effects of 
revenue products).  Determine the average APH yield of the pool  
 
 
 
 
versus the county.  Compare the pool rate at the pool yield to the 
county rate at the county yield.  If the result is less than 20% 
higher, do not establish the high rate area for that crop or consider 
removing an existing high rate area. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(3)(c) Determine rate when not practical to do (a) or (b).  If the high rate 
area is determined to be necessary and justifiable, start the area 
with a 20% rate increase (multiplicative factor of 1.20) and monitor 
experience over several years to determine needed adjustments.  
 
 
5C 
Climatic Conditions and Microclimates 
 
C(1) 
The climatic conditions, length of growing season, Growing Degree Days 
(GDD), risk of frost and/or freeze are so common in the area or micro 
climate that the success in growing the crop (or lack of data) may be 
infrequent and it cannot be determined that the crop is adapted to the 
area.  Frost and freeze probabilities (temperature, frequency, and 
duration) associated with the crop (annual or 
perennial)/type/variety/growth stage, geographic location, and topography 
are important considerations when it comes to determinations of 
insurance coverage and appropriate rates (premium) that are acceptable 
to the insured and insurer.  The below listed items identify possible 
considerations when making frost and freeze rating determinations.   See 
also [6 Unclassified/Unrated Land]. 
 
C(2) 
The county contains numerous microclimates or areas where the growing 
season is limited or inadequate to produce the crop/type. 
 
C(3) 
Frost and /or freeze. Crop losses increase dramatically as the 
temperature falls below the critical temperature sometimes defined as the 
temperature at which a 10% loss in production is expected.  As an 
example the difference between a light 10 percent killing frost and a 
disastrous 90% kill may be 3 degrees Fahrenheit.

General High Risk Rate Calculations.  
 
C(1) 
The basic formula for rating a high-risk peril such as flood is: 
 
 
 
F x S = Peril Base Premium Rate Add-on 
 
Where: 
 
F = Frequency of Loss Occurrence Over Time 
S = Severity of Loss  
 
C(2) 
A rate determination for measurable risk within defined boundaries 
may involve the use of two modified forms of this basic rate formula 
depending on what type of rating (Worst Case Rating verses Class 
Average Rating) best fits the characteristics of the risk and its location.

measures actual or relative land productivity. 
 
 
Rates are set according to risk of loss in identified areas of the county with the 
objective of collecting sufficient premiums to pay indemnities and accumulate a 
reserve over time.  See also [5C High Risk Land Rate Classification/Climatic 
Conditions and Microclimates]. 
 
 
6B 
Reasons for identifying an area(s) within a county as unclassified/unrated  
 
B(1) 
Coverage will not be provided for areas not considered suitable for 
production of the commodity being insured. 
 
(1)(a) Noncropland (i.e., NRCS Class VIII rating or severe limitations 
make them unsuitable for production of the insured crops, parks, 
military reservations, etc) where it is felt they need to be identified. 
 
 
 
(1)(b) Land that is uninsurable or has uninsurable causes of loss based 
on the policy (i.e., subject to backup/contained water/flood 
easements, stripmines, reclaimed land, etc.). 
 
 
 
(1)(c) Classes of soils identified by NRCS whose severe limitations 
make them unsuitable for crop production. 
 
 
B(2) 
Soils and/or climate are not considered suitable for production of the 
commodity being insured due to factors such as productivity, moisture 
availability, growing season restrictions. 
 
(2)(a) The risk of growing the insured crop in this area is so great and/or 
uncertain that a sound insurance program cannot be operated. 
 
(2)(b) The land and/or risk factors in question have so much variation 
within these areas that rating on an area basis is not possible.  
The risks are so “variable” that the crop cannot be pre-rated on a 
map and must be individually rated by Written Agreement, FCI-33 
Legal Descriptor or FCI-33 Supplement. 
 
(2)(c) Land along major rivers and islands that are farmed only during 
year’s when water levels are low. 
 
(2)(d) Cropland that has risks so “frequent and/or severe” that actuarially 
sound rates cannot be determined. 
 
(2)(e) Areas with no history of producing the crop to show adaptability, 
such as perennials in a county with numerous microclimates. 
 
23 
 
AUGUST 2003 
 
FCIC 24010 
 
(2)(f) Deep, excessively drained, very rapidly permeable soils. 
 
 (2)(g) Other factors such as disease problems. 
 
B(3) 
Insurance availability would encourage cropping patterns with 
limited yield potential and/or high risk in certain areas of a county or 
is inconsistent with recommended conservation methods.  
 
(3)(a) The county contains numerous microclimates or areas where the 
growing season is limited or inadequate to produce the crop/type. 
 
1 The climatic conditions, length of growing season, Growing 
Degree Days (GDD), risk of frost and/or freeze are so common 
in the area or micro climate that the success in growing the 
crop (or lack of data) may be so infrequent that it cannot be 
 
determined that the crop is adapted to the area.   
 
 
 
 
 
2 The crop is normally harvested before maturity for hay or 
silage in this area within a county. 
 
a Corn is traditionally harvested for silage and grain is limited 
to years with extended growing season (more Growing 
Degree Days) or higher precipitation. 
 
b Oats are traditionally harvested as hay due to limited 
growing season (lack of GDD’s) or where conditions during 
the growing season are generally hot and dry.  
 
(3)(c) The crop type or practice would not allow sufficient time for 
required conservation practices. 
 
The crop would be harvested so late in the growing season in 
these areas that a cover crop, required for conservation practices 
due to soil types in this area, could not be timely established, 
(sandhills area of a county marginally adapted to the crop, i.e., 
soybeans).  
 
(3)(d) The crop/practices are grown/carried out on a very limited basis 
and only these areas have been identified as insurable. 
 
 
6C 
Information needed to rate Unclassified/Unrated land 
 
 
C(1) 
Requests with acceptable production history, preferably a minimum of 
four years, of the crop/type/practice. 
 
 
C(2) 
Accumulated data from written agreement experience to indicate 
applicability. 
 
 
C(3) 
New varieties-disease resistance, early maturation, etc.

C(5) 
Specific information on any land improvements, (i.e., elevation of levee 
above sea level, means to remove water from inside levees, pumping

Methods of Insurance for Unclassified/Unrated land 
 
D(1) 
If the applicable information requirements of C above are met.   
 
 
If the information reviewed can be used by the RMA RO to develop an 
actuarial sound premium rate and coverage under existing terms of the 
policy, the RO can offer insurance on Unclassified/Unrated land by the 
following methods: 
 
(1)(a) Written agreement. 
 
(1)(b) Modification of FCI-32, FCI-33 Map, FCI-33 Legal Descriptor, or 
FCI-33 Supplement.

Flood Plain Characteristics And Rating Implications 
 
Type 1 
 
Characteristics: 
The profile is typical of smaller streams at the beginning of watersheds.  It may also 
describe larger rivers in mountainous areas depending on the type of existing parent 
material.  Flood plain development and agricultural use are minimal.  Slopes, lack of 
tillable land, low productivity are limitations. 
    
   
Rating Implications included with surrounding insurable land:  
There are minimal rating implications due to the absence of insurable land.  These 
profiles are usually assigned standard class rates.  Or, they may be included with 
exceptional rate classifications assigned to larger associated flood plains.

Type 2 
 
Characteristics: 
Type 1 profiles generally evolve into Type 2 profiles.  Slope of the flood plain is steep (B 
and C slopes).  A more or less constant slope exists between flood plain boundaries and 
the river.  Acreage becomes tillable depending on the suitability of soil types although 
much remains in woodland or pasture.  There are relatively few fields with uniform land 
elevations.  Floodwater drainage is usually rapid.  However, water speed will produce 
immediate damage by scouring or laying the crop down. 
 
Rating Implications:  
The uniformity of profile slope toward the river suggests class average rating is 
appropriate.

AUGUST 2003 
 
FCIC 24010 
 
Type 3 
 
Characteristics: 
The flood plain has fully developed and is generally surrounded by rolling land.  Soil 
types are often derived from a mixture of alluvial and colluvial deposits.  Very little or no 
slope exists next to the river.  There is very little or no observable development of 
primary and secondary flood plains.  Slope increases dramatically at the flood plain 
boundary.  This marked elevation increase is commonly referred to as a bluff line.   
Floodwater speed is slower.  However, drainage away from the flood plain is also 
slower.  Crop damage from extended submersion instead of water speed is typical.  
Damage from high water tables and poor internal soil drainage become more common.      
 
Rating Implications:  
Worst case rating is commonly used.  Class average rating might be used depending on 
the degree of slope (more) and severity of historical discharge volume (less) in the 
primary flood zone.  
 
Type 3 
T y p e  3  
 
 
 
Type 4 
 
Characteristics: 
This profile exists in two forms.  It may be part of a Type 3 profile in larger flood plains 
along major rivers or it may be common in regions with predominately flat terrain such as 
the Midwest.  There is very little variation in slope.  No distinction of variable flood risk 
within the profile can reasonably be made.  On a flat terrain, that would normally be a 
small creek or river may produce floods of impressive proportions even after moderate 
rainfall because extent is not confined by land elevation.  Smaller Type 4 profiles are 
often more frequently flooded than similar profiles along major rivers due to the greater 
influence of local weather.  Flood timing and its variable relationship to crop damage 
become important rating considerations.  The effects of Type 4 profile flooding a crop 
along major rivers is almost always catastrophic regardless of timing during the growing 
season.      
 
Rating Implications:  
 
Worst case rating is used.

FCIC 24010 
 
Type 5 
 
Characteristics: 
A Type 5 profile is a Type 4 profile with some minimal flood abatement measures.  
These measures may include piled dirt field boundaries, non-Corps specification levees, 
and passive drainage ditches.  Flood abatement measures may have anywhere from no 
effect on flood frequency to legitimate flood prevention depending on many other land 
characteristics.  Abatement measures may also work to increase potential crop damage 
from excessive moisture and poor drainage.  Drainage of water runoff from adjacent 
uplands or direct flooding may become increasingly difficult.    
   
 
Rating Implications:  
 
Rating may become dependent on the quality of flood abatement measures.  The entire 
flood plain may be worst case rated, only that acreage between flood abatement 
measures and the river may be worst case rated.  Or, a combination of worst case and 
class average rating may be appropriate. 
 
 
Type 5 
T y p e  6  
 
 
 
Type 6 
 
Characteristics: 
 
This profile may be found along older river channels that have changed course over 
time.  Land elevation for some portions of the flood plain is at or even below  
the current river channel.  When flooding occurs, lower elevations away from the 
river are inundated and unable to drain back into the river as water recedes.   
 
Flood damage away from the river may actually be more severe than on land adjacent to 
the river.  Direct overflow and normal runoff from surrounding land may create severe 
drainage limitations. 
   
Rating Implications:  
Worst case rating is applicable.  There may be unusual situations where worst case 
rating applies to depressional areas while class average or standard rating is reasonable 
for land closer to the river.

Type 7 
 
Characteristics: 
This irregular profile is usually produced by variation of parent material within the flood 
plain.  Parent materials subject to differing rates of erosion and older colluvial or glacial 
deposits contribute to the ‘washboard’ appearance of this profile.  Potential flood 
damage on associated farmland is highly variable.  There may be knolls in the flood 
plain that do not flood aside depressional areas similar to a Type 6 profile. 
 
Rating Implications:  
Appropriate rating methods are dependent on the distribution and size of farmed fields 
within the flood plain.  If only those areas not subject to flood are farmed, standard rating 
may be used.  If fields are large with continuous mono-cropping across the flood plain, 
class average rating may be used.  If only small fields in lower areas are farmed, worst 
case rating is used.

Type 8 
 
Characteristics: 
 
A Type 8 profile is similar to a Type 4 profile.  The difference is a Type 4 profile is 
beginning to show development of primary and secondary flood plains.  It is often not 
possible to physically distinguish between them for rating purposes. 
 
Rating Implications:  
 
Average class or worst case may be appropriate depending on the distribution and slope 
of land in each flood plain.

Type 9 
 
Characteristics: 
Type 9 profiles have extensive primary and secondary flood plain development.  
It is possible to separate land for rating purposes.  
 
 
 
Rating Implications:  
Generally, average class rating is applied to secondary flood plains due to lower risk and 
increasing slope.  Worst case is appropriate for primary flood plains depending on the 
extent and quality of flood control structures. 
   
 
 
Type 9 
T
 
 
 
 
 
Type 10 
 
Characteristics: 
A Type 10 profile may have characteristics similar to any other type of flood plain.  The 
difference is presence of a substantial flood control structure on one side of the flood 
plain.  In this case, the levee may be a Corps Specification levee that is privately owned.  
Existence of the structure may decrease risk behind the levee; however, severity of 
flooding on the river side of the structure is general increased.  This is because 
constriction of the flood plain forces water to move faster and spread out further on the 
opposite side of the river.    
   
 
 
Rating Implications:  
Land behind the levee may be assigned standard or average class ratings depending on 
the quality of the levee, seep potential, susceptibility of soil types to excessive moisture 
damage, and drainage limitations.  Worst case rating is generally applicable to land 
between the river and the levee and land on the opposite side of the river.

Type 11 
 
Characteristics: 
This profile is characteristic of the largest rivers.  Corps Specification or better 
levees on each side of the river define the flood plain.  Construction of the levees 
is substantial and failure is not expected even under severe conditions.  
Breaching does occur although not generally more often than every twenty-five to 
fifty years. 
 
 
Rating Implications:  
Land behind the levee may be assigned standard or average class ratings 
depending on the quality of the levee, seep potential, susceptibility of soil types 
to excessive moisture damage, and drainage limitations.  Worst case rating is 
applicable to land between the river and the levees.

Reference To Actuarial Structures  
 
Almost all actuarial structures in use to classify risk and assign premium rates have their basis 
in the assumption that productivity and risk are related.  As productivity increases, risk and its 
associated premium rate decrease.  General types of structures include: 
 
Single risk classification:  This actuarial structure is generally established in counties with 
limited crop acreage and potential risk variation among insureds.  A single class rate applies to 
all insured acreage.  An example might be an apple program in a predominately flat county with 
100 potential acres.  A low number of insureds and a lack of evident risk variation suggest a 
county-wide rate is the most appropriate structure.  
 
Multiple risk classifications: Continuous rating methods, and producer listing yield 
classifications, farm yield groupings, soil productivity groupings, and practice-type-variety 
groupings.  The basic underwriting concept of multi-class rating is to account for variable risk 
exposure.  Use of multi-class structures makes it is possible to attract a better risk with lower 
premiums while continuing to adequately rate for the higher risk.  If this approach is successful, 
rates may be reduced thereby attracting more business.  In a county with many acres of a crop, 
the relationship between risk and productivity generally holds true although other program 
features or the presence of exceptional risk may work to degrade the actual relationship.  In a 
county with limited crop acreage, this relationship may not exist.  Over- or under-rating of all 
multiple risk classifications is possible if they are not systematically reviewed. 
 
Exceptional or High Risk Classification:  The actuarial structure for exceptional risk is simply 
an extension of single or multi-class rating.  Almost all perils and associated losses have a 
random occurrence in a county.  For example, hail may damage crop production on 100 acres 
in part of a county; however, future recurrence on the same location is unknown and 
unpredictable. This type of random loss, which may happen at any location, is the basis of a 
county average rate shared by all insurance participants.    The exceptional risk does not exhibit 
random loss behavior.  Exceptional risk is the expectation of repetitious loss from one or more 
perils in a definable location.  The best example of exceptional risk for crop and other lines of 
property insurance is flood.  Flood occurs within the physical bounds of a flood plain.  It is a 
measurable peril with historical frequency that is expected to continue into the future.  Other 
perils also exhibit this tendency toward repetitious loss due to the natural limitations of certain 
soils.   These characteristics such as aluminum toxicity, poor drainage, sand content, land 
degradation, or high water table often mimic or exacerbate the effects of a weather related peril. 
 
Price coverage plans (RA, CRC, IP, etc.) and Group Risk Plan coverage also have a revenue 
factor that must be considered along with yield components in determining risk.
