RS19552
This bill creates an emergency surcharge to be paid by persons who commit crimes and infractions.
The surcharge would enable the Judicial Branch, during the current ﬁnancial crisis, to continue to
fulﬁll its constitutional responsibilities and to provide services that beneﬁt the people of the State
of Idaho and help to reduce the burden on the state budget. Each person who is found guilty or
pleads guilty to a criminal offense or infraction, committed between April 15, 2010, and June 30,
2013, would pay a $20 fee for each offense or infraction. Eighty percent of the fees collected
would be deposited in the Drug Court, Mental Health Court and Family Court Services Fund, and
twenty percent would be deposited in the Idaho Statewide Trial Court Automated Records System
(ISTARS) Fund.
The Judicial Branch has participated fully in the budget holdbacks and has searched for innovative
ways to provide court services more efﬁciently.
Further cuts would gravely impair efforts to
provide Idaho’s citizens the justice to which they are constitutionally entitled, and to continue
such beneﬁcial programs as drug courts and mental health courts.
To prevent these consequences, the Judicial Branch proposes the adoption of court costs that will
be dedicated to the needs of the courts, that will be paid by users of the courts who have committed
offenses, and that will enable the courts to keep their doors open and to continue to operate the
programs that are more necessary than ever during these challenging times.
The emergency
surcharge will provide approximately an additional $4.1 million to the dedicated funds, relieving
the pressure on general fund dollars. The funds raised through the emergency surcharge will be
used solely to continue court operations and to fund needed services and programs as provided
by Idaho Code §§ 1­1623 and 1­1625.
This bill includes an emergency clause that will permit the application of the emergency surcharge
to crimes and infractions occurring on or after April 15, 2010. It also provides, through what
amounts to a sunset provision, that the emergency surcharge will not apply to offenses committed
after June 30, 2013. This will permit further review over the next three years of the ﬁnancial outlook
and the needs of the Judicial Branch.
FISCAL NOTE
Based on ﬁgures from calendar year 2009 and expected collection rates, it is estimated that the
emergency surcharge will generate $4,121,400 annually.
Of this amount, $3,297,100 will be
deposited in the Drug Court, Mental Health Court and Family Court Services Fund, and $824,300
in the ISTARS Fund.
