Appeal from the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims in Case No. 05-

__________________________ 
DECIDED:  September 2, 2008 
 
__________________________ 
 
Before NEWMAN, MAYER, and SCHALL, Circuit Judges. 
 
Opinion for the court filed by Circuit Judge NEWMAN.  Concurring opinion filed by 
Circuit Judge SCHALL. 
 
This appeal centers on the attempt of Fortunata Capellan to establish that her 
husband, Santiago A. Capellan, was killed in the Battle of Bataan in 1942 while in the 
Armed Forces of the Philippines in the service of the United States Armed Forces.  His 
body was never recovered.  Mrs. Capellan’s claim is founded on 38 U.S.C. '107, which 
provides certain veterans benefits to members of the Philippine military services who 
were incorporated into the United States Armed Forces.  See 38 C.F.R. '3.40. 
After the war Mrs. Capellan applied for veterans’ benefits based on her 
husband’s service.  The application was granted and Mrs. Capellan received benefits 
for several months in 1950 until they were terminated in August of that year.  This 
appeal is from the most recent denial of her claim for dependency and indemnity 
compensation, by decision of the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims 
(the “Veterans Court”).  The Veterans Court held that Mr. Capellan’s military service had 
not been established by an official United States military document or verified by a 
United States service department pursuant to 38 C.F.R. §3.203, and declined to 
consider the new evidence from Philippine military authorities.1  In its ruling the 
Veterans Court appears to have diverged from other decisions concerning verification of 
Philippine military service when new information was provided after an earlier adverse 
determination.  See, e.g., Padilla v. Nicholson, No. 05-2518, 2007 WL 412356, at *2 
(Vet. App. Jan. 3, 2007) (requiring review of new information); Dela Cruz v. Nicholson, 
No. 04-137, 2005 WL 3057877, at *3-*4 (Vet. App. Oct. 21, 2005) (requiring review of 
new information). 
At the threshold, the government challenges our jurisdiction of this appeal. 
Jurisdiction 
Pursuant to 38 U.S.C. '7292(a), as amended in 2002, this court has appellate 
authority “with respect to the validity of a decision of the [Veterans Court] on a rule of 
                                            
1 
Capellan v. Nicholson, No. 05-1990, 2007 WL 561972 (Vet. App. Feb. 22, 
2007). 
 
 
2007-7236

law or of any statute or regulation . . . or any interpretation thereof . . . that was relied on 
by the Court in making the decision.”  However, except to the extent that an appeal 
presents a constitutional issue, this court “may not review (A) a challenge to a factual 
determination, or (B) a challenge to a law or regulation as applied to the facts of a 
particular case.”  38 U.S.C. '7292(d)(2).  The 2002 amendment to '7292(a) enlarged 
our jurisdiction beyond issues of the validity or interpretation of a statute or regulation, to 
include review of any legal principle and its interpretation.  See Morgan v. Principi, 327 
F.3d 1357, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (“[T]he amendment enacted by Congress has the 
effect of making the review of ‘a decision of the Court [of Appeals for Veterans Claims] 
on a rule of law’ a separate jurisdictional basis, and textually independent of whether 
that rule of law was ‘relied on’. . . .”); see also Wilson v. Principi, 391 F.3d 1203, 1209 
(Fed. Cir. 2004) (“We have interpreted the revised statute as conferring on this court a 
form of ‘case jurisdiction,’ as opposed to ‘issue jurisdiction.’”). 
The Secretary of Veterans Affairs (herein “the VA”) argues that this court does 
not have jurisdiction to consider any aspect of this appeal, stating that Mrs. Capellan is 
simply seeking review of a factual determination concerning Mr. Capellan’s military 
service.  Mrs. Capellan argues that the decision of the Veterans Court was based on an 
incorrect interpretation of certain statutes and regulations.  The issues she raises 
primarily concern 38 C.F.R. '3.203, a VA regulation that relates to evidence of military 
service and that states the procedures to be followed by claimants and by the VA in 
collaboration with the military services.  Mrs. Capellan argues that this regulation was 
incorrectly interpreted in view of the VA’s statutory duty to assist, 38 U.S.C. '5103A, 
and the benefit-of-the-doubt statute applicable to veterans’ claims, 38 U.S.C. §5107(b). 
 
 
2007-7236

We conclude that the jurisdictional requirements of §7292 are met.  See Alpough 
v. Nicholson, 490 F.3d 1352, 1358 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (accepting jurisdiction where the 
Veterans Court relied on erroneous interpretations of 38 U.S.C. '101(3) and 38 C.F.R. 
'3.53(b) in rejecting surviving spouse’s claim for benefits); Wilson, 391 F.3d at 1211 
(accepting jurisdiction and remanding for reapplication of EAJA in light of statutory 
change and intervening precedent).  We thus accept jurisdiction, and remand for 
reapplication of the relevant statutory and regulatory provisions, consistent with this 
opinion. 
BACKGROUND 
Before and during World War II the Commonwealth of the Philippines was a 
territory of the United States.2  On July 26, 1941 President Roosevelt placed the military 
forces of the Philippines in the service of the United States Armed Forces in the Far 
East (USAFFE).  See Military Order, 6 Fed. Reg. 3825 (July 26, 1941).  The United 
States duly provided that members of the Philippine military forces who fought the 
Japanese invasion, or Philippine persons who fought as guerrillas during the Japanese 
occupation, and their survivors, were eligible for certain benefits from the United States.  
See 38 U.S.C. '107(a) (defining Philippine service qualifying for certain benefits, 
including dependency and indemnity compensation for a surviving spouse pursuant to 
chapter 13 of title 38); 38 C.F.R. ''3.40, 3.41 (specifying types of Philippine service 
qualifying for dependency and indemnity compensation benefits).

Before the war, the Philippines had achieved a measure of self-
governance pursuant to the Philippine Independence Act of 1934, Pub. L. No. 73-127, 
48 Stat. 456.  The Philippines became independent on July 4, 1946.  See generally 
Quiban v. Veterans Admin., 928 F.2d 1154, 1156-58 (D.C. Cir. 1991).

After the war Mrs. Capellan filed a claim for death pension and other benefits 
based on her husband’s military service and his death at Bataan.  A United States Army 
Report dated August 2, 1948 states that the Army confirmed that Santiago A. Capellan 
served in the military service of the United States through the Philippine Commonwealth 
Army, that his service began on December 23, 1941, and that he was killed in action on 
February 28, 1942 during the battle for Bataan.  The Report states that Mr. Capellan 
was a private in “B” Company, 1st Battalion, 1st Infantry Regiment, and that three 
affidavits pertaining to his military service were attached.  On August 17, 1950 the Army 
issued another Report, stating that Mr. Capellan “has no recognized guerrilla service 
nor was he a member of the Commonwealth Army in the service of the Armed Forces of 
the United States.”  The 1950 Report does not explain the change from the 1948 
Report, although it refers to a separate “loyalty report” on Mr. Capellan’s father which is 
not included in the record.  Mrs. Capellan briefly received benefits from the VA but they 
were terminated in 1950. 
The activity relevant to this appeal is focused on documentation from the 
Philippine military authorities that Mrs. Capellan received in 1997 with respect to her 
husband’s service and death at Bataan.  A document dated December 9, 1997, signed 
by Records Officer Romeo L. Soriben and Captain Narciso S. Erna, Assistant Adjutant 
General of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, certified that Private Santiago Capellan 
served in the “B Co 1st Bn 1st Regt,” and described his service as: 
Beleaguered status fr 19 Dec 41 to 28 Fed 42; Died at Bagac, Bataan 
Phils on 28 Fed 42; Termination of casualty status on 23 Oct 44 (RPD dtd 
20 Nov 47)

Admin. Rec. at 15.  Mrs. Capellan also received a certification of the records of the 
Armed Forces of the Philippines dated December 3, 1997 and signed by Captain 
Narciso Erna, which recorded payments made in arrears for Mr. Capellan’s service 
while a member of the Commonwealth Army of the Philippines in the 
service of the USAFFE/GRLA. 
 
Admin. Rec. at 16.  These documents were submitted in January 1998 to the VA 
Regional Office in Manila.  In October 1999 the Regional Office wrote Mrs. Capellan 
that it was unable to locate the relevant claims files and requested additional 
information.  The Regional Office letter stated: 
So that proper adjudicative action may be taken on your claim, you must 
furnish the following: 
$ 
VA Form 21-534.  Please fill out every blank which applies to you. 
$ 
VA Form 21-4138.  Please explain why your benefits were 
terminated in July 1950. 
$ 
Copies of Notices of Award and Disallowance to include all 
available previous VA correspondence. 
$ 
A copy of the veteran’s death certificate. 
$ 
A copy of your marriage certificate. 
Admin. Rec. at 24.  Mrs. Capellan responded in December 1999, providing both 
requested VA forms and stating that she had not received a death certificate because 
her husband’s “body was unrecovered and no document was issued to us by proper 
authorities.  I hope that this military service record will serve as his death certificate.”  
She included a copy of her marriage certificate, and explained that her copies of the 
Notices of Awards and Disallowances were misplaced or lost and could not be provided.  
She explained that Mr. Capellan’s father had received a letter from the VA in July 1950 
asking for Mr. Capellan’s military service record but that “[w]e were not able to submit 
the document needed because of improper guidance,” and referred to a February 1951 
 
 
2007-7236 
6
letter from the VA stating that her benefits were terminated “for the reason that my 
husband has no recognized guerilla service.” 
The Regional Office requested a search for Mr. Capellan’s military records from 
the National Personnel Records Center (NPRC) in Missouri.  The NPRC is part of the 
United States National Archives and Records Administration, and receives and stores 
records of various types concerning persons who served in the Armed Forces.  The 
NPRC provided the Regional Office with the 1948 U.S. Army report, which stated that 
Mr. Capellan had served with the Philippine Commonwealth Army in the service of the 
United States Armed Forces from December 23, 1941 through February 28, 1942 when 
he was killed in action.  The Regional Office then wrote the NPRC that it had “reason to 
believe that there may have been a subsequent (1950) re-certification that revoked the 
1948 report.”  The NPRC then provided the 1950 Army Report, the NPRC stating that 
“the determination of that date (8/17/50) stands.”  The record provided on this appeal 
does not reflect that the VA provided the Philippine military records, or any of Mrs. 
Capellan’s other evidence, to the NPRC for verification of service. 
The Regional Office then denied Mrs. Capellan’s claim, stating that under 38 
C.F.R. '3.203 decisions concerning verification of military service are the responsibility 
of the NPRC and “are binding on the VA which has no authority to change or amend the 
findings.”  Although the Regional Office decision listed the evidence provided by Mrs. 
Capellan, including the newly provided 1997 documents from the Philippine military 
officials and other post-1950 materials, the record shows no evaluation of this evidence 
by the NPRC, the Regional Office, or any United States military authority.  The Regional 
Office decision did not state that any of Mrs. Capellan’s post-1950 evidence had been 
 
 
2007-7236 
7
provided to the NPRC or any other authority for review.  The denial informed Mrs. 
Capellan of her right to appeal, which would commence by filing a Notice of 
Disagreement with the Regional Office. 
Mrs. Capellan submitted a Notice of Disagreement, attaching some previously 
submitted documentation from various Philippine authorities, including a document 
dated March 5, 2002 from the Philippine Veterans Affairs Office stating that it certified 
that Santiago Capellan “is a veteran of World War II/Philippine Revolution who served 
with 1st Reg. Div. PA with the grade/rank Pvt,” that his service was in the USAFFE, and 
that an Old Age Pension for his widow Fortunata Capellan based on his service was 
approved on June 20, 1991.  Mrs. Capellan also refiled an October 25, 1955 affidavit of 
Major Jose M. Javier, the commanding officer of the “B” Company, 1st Battalion, 1st 
Infantry Regiment Division, which included the following: 
5.  That I know officially and personally the late veteran, 
SANTIAGO CAPELLAN, a reservist who reported to active duty in the 
Philippine Army and was inducted into the USAFFE on or about 18 
December 1941, at Camp Murphy, by an American Officer, and was 
assigned to my unit (“B” Co, 1st Bn, 1st Reg Div) as filler when my unit 
suffered casualties after the fierce fighting against the enemy at Mauban, 
Quezon; that said veteran, Santiago Capellan, was inducted into the 
USAFFE as Private; 
6.  That the late Pvt. Santiago Capellan had rendered continuous 
service and had seen actions in Bataan where he was killed in action 
during the enemy bombing of our line of resistance at Bagac, Bataan, on 
or about 15 February 1942, and died instantly; 
 
Admin. Rec. at 77. 
Other evidence submitted in 2002 included a Philippine Veterans Affairs Office 
list of veterans including Mr. Capellan who were entitled to shares of the Philippine 
Veterans Bank, and a stock certificate from the Philippine Veterans Bank showing Mrs. 
 
 
2007-7236 
8
Capellan’s status as the widow and heir of Santiago Capellan.  Also resubmitted was an 
affidavit, dated August 18, 1946, of both the mayor and the chief of police of the city of 
Lopez, where Mr. Capellan had lived, stating that they each personally knew 
Santiago Capellan, a Reservist Private who left this municipality of Lopez, 
province of Tayabas, for active Military Service on December 19, 1941, 
and from that time to the present time [August 18, 1946], said Reservist, 
Santiago Capellan had not returned to his family. 
 
Admin. Rec. at 78.  Also resubmitted was the March 20, 1969 affidavit of two military 
comrades of Mr. Capellan, Vicente Pilarca and Inocencio Anacion, who stated that they 
served with Santiago Capellan in the Philippine Army at Bataan and saw him hit by 
enemy bullets and killed.  The affidavit states: 
That we both personally know one, SANTIAGO CAPELLAN, a boyhood 
friend and townmate whom we met in Bataan somewhere in Abucay, and 
who told us, he was in uniform, that he was inducted into the USAFFE at 
Lucena, Quezon (Tayabas) as private in "B" Co., 1st Inf. under Lt. 
Cuaresma; 
That in the main Japanese Offensive at Balanga, we met the said veteran 
and in the haste of retreat, we chanced to be together and that while 
together, he was hit by enemy bullets causing his death, his body having 
been unrecovered; 
That the late Private SANTIAGO CAPELLAN died in action on or about 
the month of February, the date we could not recall at present, in the year 
1942; 
That we know the above facts because the said veteran was with us 
during the critical days of the battle at Bataan and we personally saw him 
hit and died of enemy bullets; 
 
Admin. Rec. at 100. 
The Regional Office held a hearing in Manila on September 10, 2002.  In addition 
to the documentary records, Mrs. Capellan and two family members testified that her 
husband was killed in action while serving in the USAFFE.  They provided a photograph 
of Mr. Capellan in military uniform, and a group photo with his battalion.  The Regional 
 
 
2007-7236 
9
Office then denied the claim, stating that the 1950 Army Report was dispositive and that 
the entirety of the evidence provided by Mrs. Capellan “cannot be accepted as proof of 
military service of your deceased husband in absence of substantiating evidence in the 
records of the Army.”  The Regional Office did not discuss any of the evidence, and 
sought no substantiation from the United States or Philippine military authorities. 
Mrs. Capellan appealed to the Board of Veterans Appeals, which held that the 
duties to notify and to assist should be applied, and remanded “to obtain additional 
development and full compliance with the VA’s due process requirements.”  On March 
5, 2004 the VA Appeals Management Center wrote to Mrs. Capellan and asked her to 
“Please provide us with any evidence or information you may have pertaining to your 
appeal.  Provide medical evidence (that you have not already submitted) that will show 
that the deceased had valid military service.”  The letter stated that the VA was 
responsible for retrieving “[r]elevant records from any Federal agency,” and would make 
reasonable efforts to get “[r]elevant records not held by a Federal agency.”  Mrs. 
Capellan was instructed to “give us enough information about your records so that we 
can request them from the person or agency that has them.”  The letter also stated:  “It’s 
your responsibility to make sure that we receive all requested records that aren’t in the 
possession of a Federal department or agency.” 
On April 24, 2004 Mrs. Capellan replied to the Appeals Management Center and 
referred to the evidence in her file, pointing to the affidavits from persons who knew Mr. 
Capellan and witnessed his military service and saw his death in action at Bataan.  She 
stated that his body was never recovered, and that there was thus no medical evidence 
of his death.  The Appeals Management Center then denied her claim, stating that “[t]he 
 
 
2007-7236 
10
“evidence clearly indicates that Santiago A. Capellan has no recognized guerrilla 
service, nor was he a member of the Commonwealth Army of the Philippines in the 
service of the Armed Forces of the United States.”  The decision did not discuss any of 
Mrs. Capellan’s evidence, and it appears that the Center relied solely on the 1950 U.S. 
Army Report in reaching its conclusion, stating that “substantial evidence” to refute this 
conclusion had not been submitted.  The Center did not say how or if the Center had 
assisted, although it stated that a March 2003 letter met the VA’s duty to notify the 
claimant of her rights. 
Mrs. Capellan appealed to the Board, and summarized the material she had 
submitted as follows: 
It is not only the Affidavits of Lucia V. Almacha and Natividad C. 
Escobido [relatives] that were submitted.  But many other documents that 
substantiated my claim and considered as New and Material Evidences. 
Some of the material evidences are as follows: 
1. 
Affidavit of Mr. Vicente Pilarca. 
An eyewitness that my husband in Uniform as a USAFFE 
participated in the Battle of Bataan. 
2. 
Inocencio Anacion 
Comrades-in-arms and eyewitness that my husband in 
uniform of the USAFFE was killed in action in Bataan. 
3. 
Masterlists of the Shareholders of Stock Certificate of the Philippine 
Veterans Bank, owned by the World War II Veterans. 
4. 
Certification of Military Service from the Non-Current Branch Office 
Division, Gen. Headquarters, AFP, Camp Gen. Emilio Aguinaldo, 
Quezon City, Philippines. 
5. 
Certification of Salaries and Allowances received during the World 
War II, as a Backpay from the Gen. Headquarters, Camp Gen. 
Emilio Aguinaldo, Quezon City, Philippines. 
6. 
Certification from the Phil. Veterans Affairs Office of my husband's 
Military Service during World War II. 
7. 
Affidavit of Mr. Jose M. Javier, during their Defense of Bataan, 
together with my husband. 
8. 
Picture of my husband during their USAFFE training in Port Area, 
Manila, Philippines, in uniform.  His picture is with a check.

On March 25, 2005 the Board denied Mrs. Capellan's claim, stating that none of 
the evidence she submitted could be considered because none of it was a “document 
issued by a U.S. Service Department,” quoting 38 C.F.R. '3.203.  The Board cited Duro 
v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 530 (1992), which held that the “VA is prohibited from finding, 
on any basis other than a service department document, which VA believes to be 
authentic and accurate, or service department verification, that a particular individual 
served in the U.S. Armed Forces.”  Id. at 532.  She was informed of the right to appeal 
to the Veterans Court. 
With her appeal to the Veterans Court, Mrs. Capellan again pointed to the 
evidence from the Philippine military authorities and others attesting to her husband's 
military service and to his death at Bataan.  She stated that a thorough investigation by 
the Philippine Judge Advocate General’s Office in 1947 had determined that Mr. 
Capellan had served and was killed in action, and provided the additional information 
that had been before the Board.  She stated that it was known that Philippine military 
personnel were not fully recorded in the NPRC archives, citing specific examples, and 
that these records were especially deficient as to Philippine personnel killed in the war. 
In the Veterans Court, the VA acknowledged Mrs. Capellan’s evidence, including 
the certification of her husband’s military status from the Philippine Armed Forces, but 
argued that there was a “plausible basis” for the Board’s decision in light of the 
evidentiary requirements of 38 C.F.R. §3.203.  The Veterans Court ruled that the VA is 
bound by the United States Army’s 1950 report, and that none of the subsequent 
evidence could be considered because it was not issued by a United States military 
service department.  The Veterans Court cited Duro, 2 Vet. App. at 532, and Soria v. 
 
 
2007-7236 
12
Brown, 118 F.3d 747, 749 (Fed. Cir. 1997), where the Federal Circuit observed that 
“Philippine veterans are not eligible for veterans’ benefits unless a United States service 
department documents or certifies their service.”  Subsequent cases have recognized 
that the Soria decision preceded the enactment in 2000 of the statutory duty to assist.  
See Palor v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 325, 330-31 (2007) (discussing effect of Veterans 
Claims Assistance Act on Soria decision). 
DISCUSSION 
The record does not show any request by any VA authority for service 
department review of any of the documents provided by Mrs. Capellan as she 
proceeded, over the years, in the Regional Office and the Board of Veterans Appeals 
and the Veterans Court — although 38 C.F.R. '3.203(c) states that the VA “shall 
request verification of service from the service department”: 
38 C.F.R. '3.203  Service records as evidence of service and character of 
discharge. 
    (a) Evidence submitted by a claimant.  For the purpose of establishing 
entitlement to pension, compensation, dependency and indemnity 
compensation or burial benefits the Department of Veterans Affairs may 
accept evidence of service submitted by the claimant (or sent directly to 
the Department of Veterans Affairs by the service department), such as a 
DD Form 214, Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty, or 
original Certificate of Discharge, without verification from the appropriate 
service department if the evidence meets the following conditions: 
(1) The evidence is a document issued by the service 
department. . . . 
 
. . . . 
    (c) Verification from the service department.  When the claimant does 
not submit evidence of service or the evidence submitted does not meet 
the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section (and paragraph (b) of this 
section in pension claims), the Department of Veterans Affairs shall 
request verification of service from the service department. . . .   
 
Section 3.203 is a general evidentiary rule; it contains no special provisions concerning 
Philippine military service as recognized under 38 U.S.C. §107(a).  Thus section 
 
 
2007-7236 
13
3.203(c) requires verification of service from the service department whenever a 
claimant lacks the kind of official evidence specified in section 3.203(a).  The reports of 
all of the tribunals in the records provided to us show that they treated the 1950 Army 
Report as dispositive because it was the last review by the Army.  While this 1950 Army 
Report was located by the NPRC in response to a specific VA search request in 2001, 
after the first VA search request had turned up only the 1948 Army Report, the record 
does not show that the VA ever provided any of Mrs. Capellan’s post-1950 evidence to 
the Army or to the NPRC.  Mrs. Capellan argues that this rejection of her claim without 
review of all the evidence did not comport with the VA’s duty to assist her, and the 
obligation to afford her claim the benefit of the doubt based on all the evidence.  The 
provision by the NPRC of the Reports in its archives does not constitute review of all the 
evidence related to military service. 
The “duty to assist,” 38 U.S.C. '5103A; 38 C.F.R. §3.159, although mentioned by 
the VA, does not appear to have been invoked to provide agency assistance in 
procuring the requisite “verification of service from the service department.”  Similarly, 
the “benefit of the doubt” statute, 38 U.S.C. §5107(b), was ruled inapplicable by the 
Veterans Court because the court stated that the evidence was not in equipoise.  The 
Veterans Court, like the Board, interpreted 38 C.F.R. §3.203(c) to negate consideration 
of the post-1950 evidence submitted by the claimant.  This interpretation of section 
3.203(c), relied on by the Veterans Court and the VA, is incorrect in light of the legal 
requirements of assistance to claimants. 
The “duty to assist” statute and regulations apply to all evidence needed to 
substantiate a claim.  The VA’s obligation includes assisting the claimant in developing 
 
 
2007-7236 
14
her claim by making “as many requests as are necessary to obtain relevant records 
from a Federal department or agency.”  38 C.F.R. §3.159(c)(2).  In this case, it is not 
explained how this duty was met, for, according to the record, service department 
consideration was not requested for any evidence that Mrs. Capellan provided after 
1950.  The Veterans Court has interpreted section 3.203(c) consonant with the current 
duty to assist, stating that “when a claimant submits evidence establishing that the 
service department’s certification was based upon erroneous information, a second 
certification may be required.”  Laruan v. West, 11 Vet. App. 80, 82 (1998) (en banc), 
overruled on other grounds by D’Amico v. West, 209 F.3d 1322, 1327 (Fed. Cir. 2000).  
Similarly, in Padilla v. Nicholson, No. 05-2518, 2007 WL 412356, at *2 (Vet. App. Jan. 3, 
2007) the Veterans Court held that the Board erred in relying on an earlier NPRC record 
rather than submitting the new evidence concerning the claimed military service.  The 
court stated: “When new identifying information is provided by the appellant, the 
Secretary ‘shall request verification of service from the service department.’” Id. (quoting 
38 C.F.R. §3.203(c)).  See also Dela Cruz v. Nicholson, No. 04-137, 2005 WL 3057877, 
at *3 (Vet. App. Oct. 21, 2005) (applying duty to assist where it was unclear whether the 
proper form had been used to obtain an affidavit from the Philippine Army in connection 
with a request for verification of service).  In Sarmiento v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 80 (1994), 
overruled on other grounds by D’Amico, 209 F.3d at 1227, the Veterans Court stated 
that “there is no stated limit on the number of times that the Secretary ‘shall’ request 
service department verification when one claiming entitlement fails to submit qualifying 
evidence of service.”  Id. at 85.  We conclude that the correct interpretation of the 
governing statutes and regulations requires that a claimant’s new evidence be

submitted and considered in connection with a request for “verification of service from 
the service department” pursuant to 38 C.F.R. §3.203(c). 
The “benefit of the doubt” statute, 38 U.S.C. §5107(b), and the analogous 
“reasonable doubt” regulation, 38 C.F.R. §3.102, apply to all material issues relating to 
a claim, including verification of military service.  See Kelly v. Nicholson, 463 F.3d 1349, 
1354 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (stating that 38 U.S.C. §5107(b) “applies not only to decisions 
relating to the overall merits of a claim, but by its plain language it applies to all 
decisions determining any material issue relating to a claim”).  The VA argues that these 
provisions are outside our appellate jurisdiction because they relate to the weighing of 
evidence, which is excluded from our review by 38 U.S.C. §7292(d)(2).  We agree that 
the weighing of evidence is not within our appellate authority.  However, when statute 
and regulation require that the veterans’ tribunals weigh the evidence, our authority 
includes assuring that the evidence is weighed under the appropriate statutes and 
regulations.  See Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1335 (Fed. Cir. 2006) 
(Federal Circuit has jurisdiction to review interpretation of the benefit of the doubt rule 
and other legal provisions).  Both the statute and the regulation explicitly require the 
consideration of all evidence submitted by the claimant.  See 38 U.S.C. §5107(b) (“The 
Secretary shall consider all information and lay and medical evidence of record in a 
case before the Secretary with respect to benefits under laws administered by the 
Secretary.”); 38 C.F.R. §3.102 (“When, after careful consideration of all procurable and 
assembled data, a reasonable doubt exists regarding service origin, the degree of 
disability, or any other point, such doubt will be resolved in favor of the claimant.”).  The 
reasonable doubt regulation by its terms applies “even in the absence of official records,

particularly if the basic incident allegedly arose under combat, or similarly strenuous 
conditions, and is consistent with the probable results of such known hardships.”  38 
C.F.R. §3.102.  In accordance with 38 C.F.R. §3.203(c), the agency is required to 
ensure consideration of “all procurable and assembled data,” including lay evidence, in 
connection with a request for “verification of service from the service department.” 
38 C.F.R. §3.203 requires that Mr. Capellan’s military service be determined 
based on all relevant evidence, with due application of the duty to assist, 38 U.S.C. 
§5103A; 38 C.F.R. §3.159, and the statutory and regulatory requirements to consider 
“all information and lay . . . evidence of record,” 38 U.S.C. §5107(b); see also 38 C.F.R. 
§3.102.  The VA erred in denying Mrs. Capellan’s claim based on the archival 1950 
Army Report, while obtaining no review of the subsequent evidence by the service 
department.  We vacate the decision of the Veterans Court, and remand for 
determination, on the entirety of the evidence, of Mr. Capellan’s military service.

FORTUNATA CAPELLAN, 
 
Claimant-Appellant, 
 
 
v. 
 
 
JAMES B. PEAKE, M.D., 
 
Secretary of Veterans Affairs, 
 
Respondent-Appellee. 
 
 
Appeal from the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims in Case No. 05-
1990, Chief Judge William P. Greene, Jr. 
 
SCHALL, Circuit Judge, concurring. 
The court holds that the Department of Veterans Affairs (“VA”) failed to comply 
with the duty to assist because it did not furnish the Department of the Army with the 
material provided by Mrs. Capellan in support of her claim and did not request from the 
service department, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.203(c), verification of the military service 
of her husband, Santiago Capellan.  Based upon its holding, the court remands the 
case to the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (“Veterans Court”) for further 
proceedings.  In that regard, the final paragraph of the opinion reads as follows: 
38 C.F.R. §3.203 requires that Mr. Capellan’s military service be 
determined based on all relevant evidence, with due application of the 
duty to assist, 38 U.S.C. §5103A; 38 C.F.R. §3.159, and the statutory and 
regulatory requirements to consider “all information and lay . . . evidence 
of record,” 38 U.S.C. §5107(b); see also 38 C.F.R. 3.102.  The VA erred in 
denying Mrs. Capellan’s claim based on the archival 1950 Army Report, 
while obtaining no review of the subsequent evidence by the service 
department.  We vacate the decision of the Veterans Court, and remand 
for determination, on the entirety of the evidence, of Mr. Capellan’s military 
service. 
I agree that the VA failed to comply with the duty to assist.  I also agree that a 
remand is necessary.  I write separately, however, to express my view that the only 
appropriate remand in this case is a remand in which the Veterans Court directs the VA 
to request verification, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.203(c), of Santiago Capellan’s military 
service and in which the Veterans Court directs the VA to provide the service 
department with all the material submitted by Mrs. Capellan in support of her claim.  Any 
other remand activity by the Veterans Court beyond this would, in my view, be contrary 
to this court’s decision in Soria v. Brown, 118 F.3d 747 (Fed. Cir. 1997).  After the 
service department acts on the request for verification, the VA will be in a position to 
rule on Mrs. Capellan’s claim.
