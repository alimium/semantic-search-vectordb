This map is for use in administering the National Flood Insurance Program. It does
not necessarily identify all areas subject to flooding, particularly from local drainage
sources of small size.  The community map repository should be consulted for
possible updated or additional flood hazard information.
47° 00' 00"
The 1% annual chance flood (100-year flood), also  known as the  base flood, is the flood that has
a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded in  any given year.  The Special Flood Hazard Area is
the area subject to flooding by the 1% annual chance flood.  Areas of Special Flood Hazard
include Zones A, AE, AH, AO, AR, A99, V, and VE.  The Base Flood Elevation is the water-surface
elevation of the 1% annual chance flood.

To obtain more detailed information in areas where Base Flood Elevations (BFEs)
and/or floodways have been determined, users are encouraged to consult the Flood
Profiles and Floodway Data and/or Summary of Stillwater Elevations tables contained
within the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) Report that accompanies this FIRM.  Users
should be aware that BFEs shown on the FIRM represent rounded whole-foot
elevations.  These BFEs are intended for flood insurance rating purposes only and
should not be used as the sole source of flood elevation information.  Accordingly,
flood elevation data presented in the FIS Report should be utilized in conjunction with
the FIRM for purposes of construction and/or floodplain management.

Special Flood Hazard Areas formerly protected from the 1% annual chance
flood by a flood control system that was subsequently decertified.  Zone
AR indicates that the former flood control system is being restored to provide
protection from the 1% annual chance or greater flood.

ZONE A99
Area to be protected from 1% annual chance flood by a Federal flood
protection system under construction; no Base Flood Elevations determined.
ZONE V
Coastal flood zone with velocity hazard (wave action);  no Base Flood Elevations
determined.
Coastal Base Flood Elevations shown on this map apply only landward of 0.0
North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD 88).  Users of this FIRM should be
aware that coastal flood elevations are also provided in the Summary of Stillwater
Elevations table in the Flood Insurance Study Report for this jurisdiction.  Elevations
shown in the Summary of Stillwater Elevations table should be used for construction
and/or floodplain management purposes when they are higher than the elevations
shown on this FIRM.

LIMIT OF STUDY
T. 18 N.
Boundaries of the floodways were computed at cross sections and interpolated
between cross sections.  The floodways were based on hydraulic considerations with
regard to requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program.  Floodway widths
and other pertinent floodway data are provided in the Flood Insurance Study Report
for this jurisdiction.
T. 17 N.
The floodway is the channel of a stream plus any adjacent floodplain areas that must be kept free of
encroachment so that the 1% annual chance flood can  be carried without substantial increases in
flood heights.

The projection used in the preparation of this map was Universal Transverse
Mercator (UTM) zone 10.  The horizontal datum was NAD 83, GRS 1980
spheroid.  Differences in datum, spheroid, projection or UTM zones used in the
production of FIRMs for adjacent jurisdictions may result in slight positional
differences in map features across jurisdiction boundaries.  These differences do not
affect the accuracy of this FIRM.
