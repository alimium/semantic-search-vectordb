ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS 
INITIAL DECISION FINDS PAINE WEBBER WILFULLY AIDED AND ABETTED 
WILFUL VIOLATION OF TENDER OFFER PROVISIONS 
Administrative 
Law Judge David J. Markun has filed an initial decision finding that 
Paine Webber Jackson & Curtis, Incorporated, a broker-dealer 
registered with the 
Commission, wilfully aided and abetted a wilful violation of the tender offer re-
quirements of Section l4(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. 
178n(d), in purchasing for a client on the Pacific Stock Exchange, in June 1980,
9.9% of the outstanding common stock of Diamond International Corporation 
in a 
single transaction involving some 256 sellers. 
The client concededly did not 
comply with the tender offer requirements of Section l4(d) and Commission rules 
thereunder. 
A tender offer under Section l4(d) by another offeror was pending at 
the time of the June 1980 acquisition of 9.9% of the Diamond common stock by
Respondent's 
client. 
The decision further found that two associated persons of the Respondent, wholly-
owned broker-dealer 
subsidiaries Blyth Eastman Paine Webber and Paine Webber 
Mitchell Hutchins also wilfully aided and abetted the primary violation, thus 
establishing an additional basis for imposition of a sanction against the Respon-
dent. 
On the basis of several factors, Judge Markun concluded that the finding by the 
Commission of wilful aiding and abetting violations would adequately satisfy the 
public interest without imposition of a sanction upon the Respondent. 
The decision is subject to review by the commission on its own motion or on petition
of a party.

RELTRON CORP. ENJOINED 
The Commission announced that on January 5 the U.s. District Court for the 
District of Columbia entered a Final Judgment of Permanent Injunction against 
Reltron Corp. of Rochester, New York, restraining it from failing to file timely
peri06ic ~eports and ordering it to comply with certain undertakings. 
Reltron,
consenting to the entry of the Court's judgment, admitted that it had filed 
reports in an untimely manner on 13 separate occasions and failed to file six 
Notifications 
of Late Filing required to have been filed in connection with its 
late periodic reports. 
The Commission's complaint was filed on November 9, 1982. 
Reltron has agreed to adopt certain procedures to assure timely filing of reports
required to be filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

Corp., U.S.D.C. D.C., Civil Action No. 82-3191).
