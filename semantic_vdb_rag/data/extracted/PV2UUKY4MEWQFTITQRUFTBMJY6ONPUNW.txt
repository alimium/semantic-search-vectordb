Fortenberry Comments on ‘Highly Complex and Dangerous’ Situation in Egypt
WASHINGTON, D.C.--Congressman Jeff Fortenberry today issued the following statement
concerning today’s escalating clashes in Egypt:
  
"This is a highly complex and dangerous situation in the streets of Egypt.
  
"Egypt is the cultural and historic center of the Arab world and has provided a stabilizing
influence in the volatile Middle East.  This is a critical moment for the future of the country and
the region.
  
"People have the right to express their concerns with the government, and there must be space
within Egyptian civil society for the highest aspirations of the people. Peaceful and pragmatic
dialogue are necessary hallmarks of democratic change.  Unfortunately, chaos and violence is
the current dynamic.  It is important that the outcome addresses the sources of tension and
despair while preventing exploitation by violent extremists."   
Congressman Fortenberry, who has lived near Tahrir Square in Cairo, is a member of the
House Foreign Affairs Committee.
