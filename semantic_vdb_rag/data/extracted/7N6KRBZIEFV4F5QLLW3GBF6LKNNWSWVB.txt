RULING ON DEFENDANT’S MOTION
 TO SUPPRESS AND DEFENDANT’S REQUEST FOR A HEARING
For the reasons set forth below, defendant Shamar A.
Thorton’s Motion to Suppress (Doc. No. 13) and his Motion for a
Hearing (Doc. No. 14) are being denied.
I.
FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND
On or about October 5, 2005, the Hartford DEA Task Force
received information from a confidential informant regarding an
individual believed to be engaged in the sale and distribution of
crack cocaine in the Bowles Park area of Hartford.  The
confidential informant provided a physical description of the
suspect and a description of his vehicle.  On October 5, 2005, an
individual who matched the physical description provided by the
confidential informant was observed by the investigating agents
entering 251 Nahum Drive and exiting a few minutes later.  The
subject, later identified as defendant Shamar A. Thornton was
then observed entering the vehicle described by the confidential
informant and driving away from 251 Nahum Drive.  The
investigating agents observed the vehicle roll through a stop
sign and fail to signal when turning.  While the defendant was
stopped in traffic, he appeared to notice the investigating
agents’ unmarked vehicles, and he was observed checking his
mirrors and looking around as if looking for an escape route. 
When the defendant put his vehicle in reverse, the investigating
agents approached the vehicle.  The defendant appeared to panic,
and Task Force Agent Burgos observed the defendant stuff
something down the back of his pants.  The defendant was removed
from the vehicle and handcuffed.  
Task Force Agent Plourde, a certified K-9 handler, directed
his K-9 to sniff the defendant’s vehicle and person.  The K-9
alerted on the defendant’s buttocks area.  As Burgos was about to
conduct a pat down of the defendant’s person, the defendant
stated that he had stuffed a small amount of crack cocaine down
his pants and that he was sorry.  As a crowd began to assemble in
the area, the investigating agents decided to transport the
defendant to a parking lot approximately one block away. Burgos
subsequently located and seized from the defendant’s person a
plastic bag containing 25 knotted plastic bags, each of which
contained a white rock-like substance.  A field test confirmed
the presence of cocaine. 
Plourde and other investigating agents then proceeded to 251
Nahum Drive, Apartment 1A, where they met Marquila Alexander, the
defendant’s girlfriend.  Alexander confirmed that she lived in
- 2 -
the apartment with the defendant.  Alexander provided written
consent to search the apartment.  In a bedroom dresser drawer
containing male underwear and documents and letters belonging to
the defendant, the investigating agents found a Rossi .38 caliber
revolver.  In addition, a substance that later field tested
positive for cocaine and .38 caliber ammunition were seized from
a safe located inside a bedroom closet.  
The defendant was transported to the DEA’s Hartford field
office, where he was advised of his Miranda rights.  He waived
his rights and provided a written statement in which he admitted
ownership and possession of the crack cocaine, as well as the
ammunition and the firearm found at his residence.
On February 28, 2006, the defendant was arrested and charged
by criminal complaint with Possession of a Firearm by a Convicted
Felon.  On March 8, 2006, a Grand Jury sitting in Bridgeport
returned a three-count indictment charging the defendant with
Possession of a Firearm by a Convicted Felon, in violation of 18
U.S.C. § 922(g)(1), Possession with Intent to Distribute 5 or
More Grams of Cocaine Base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§
841(a)(1) and 841(b)(1)(B), and Possession of a Firearm in
Furtherance of a Drug Trafficking Crime, in violation of 21
U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A).
The defendant has moved to suppress (i) the controlled
substances seized from his person; (ii) his statement to
- 3 -
investigating agents that he stuffed a small amount of crack
cocaine down his pants; (iii) objects seized by investigating
agents from 251 Nahum Drive, Apartment 1A; and (iv) his oral and
written statements made at the DEA’s Hartford field office.     
II.
ARGUMENT
A.
Request for Evidentiary Hearing
It is well settled in the Second Circuit that a defendant
seeking to suppress evidence bears the burden of demonstrating
that there are disputed issues of fact that would justify an
evidentiary hearing.  United States v. Culotta, 413 F.2d 1343,
1345 (2d Cir. 1969); United States v. Gillette, 383 F.2d 843,
848-49 (2d Cir. 1967).  A defendant’s burden is not satisfied by
“conclusory, non-particularized allegations of unlawful official
behavior.”  United States v. Tracy, 758 F. Supp. 816, 820 (D.
Conn. 1991).  Rather, the showing required to justify a hearing
must be made by an affidavit of someone with personal knowledge
of the underlying facts; a defense attorney’s declarations are
insufficient.  Gillette, 383 F.2d at 848-49 (affidavit by defense
attorney in support of motion not based on attorney’s personal
knowledge was insufficient to create factual issues required to
be resolved at an evidentiary hearing); Shaw, 260 F. Supp.2d at
570 (same); United States v. Caruso, 684 F. Supp. 84, 87
(S.D.N.Y. 1988)(same).
- 4 -
Experience shows that unless such serious charges are
initiated upon the sworn statement of persons having
personal knowledge of the facts, a great deal of time of
the parties and the Court is frequently wasted upon
unnecessary, 
expensive 
and 
protracted 
suppression
hearings, all for the reason that the attorney demanding
suppression merely upon his own say-so often discovers
only at the hearing that he had been misled by unsworn
misrepresentations of his clients, which they would be
unwilling to swear to in an affidavit, particularly if
they were questioned closely by their counsel and warned
of the consequences of perjury.
United States v. Garcia, 272 F. Supp. 286, 290 (S.D.N.Y. 1976). 
A motion to suppress not supported by an affidavit by someone
with personal knowledge of the facts may be properly denied
without a hearing.   United States v. Ruggiero, 824 F. Supp. 379,
393-94 (S.D.N.Y 1993); United States v. Sierra-Garcia, 760 F.
Supp. 252, 264-65 (E.D.N.Y 1991).
Here, the defendant’s motion is predicated entirely on the
unsworn assertions of his counsel.  The defendant argues that the
traffic stop was not lawful because he “did not roll through a
stop sign . . did not fail to signal while turning and he did not
place the car in reverse.”  Mem. in Supp. of Def.’s Mot. to
Suppress (Doc. No. 13-2)(“Def.’s Br.”), 2.  The defendant argues
further that his statement at the scene of the traffic stop was a
product of custodial interrogation and offered without him having
received Miranda warnings. Id.  With respect to the search of 251
Nahum Drive, the defendant argues that he did not provide consent
and he “believes” that Marquila Alexander did not consent
voluntarily.  Id.  Lastly, the defendant argues that his
- 5 -
statement at the DEA’s Hartford field office was involuntary, and
given without him having received his Miranda warnings.  Id.  
The defendant submits no affidavit or other documentation in
support of his motion.
 The unsupported factual assertions of his counsel are
insufficient to warrant an evidentiary hearing or justify the
relief requested by the defendant.  Moreover, these unsworn
assertions are disputed by statements in the Hartford Police
Department incident report and in the sworn affidavit submitted
in support of the Criminal Complaint.  See Government’s Resp. to
Def.’s Mot. To Suppress and Objection to Def.’s Req. for a Hr’g
(Doc. No. 18) (“Government’s Resp.”), Ex. A; Compl., Borysevicz
Aff. (Doc. No. 1).  By way of contrast, in the absence of a sworn
statement by an affiant with personal knowledge, the defendant
has no accountability for the assertions that his counsel has
made.
The defendant argues that he should not be required to
substantiate his claims with a sworn statement because he is at
risk for an enhancement for obstruction of justice should he be
convicted and the court concludes he proffered a false sworn
statement.  The defendant provides no legal support for his
request that the court convene an evidentiary hearing without him
being required to show that there is a genuine dispute as to a
material fact.  However, a key reason for requiring a sworn
- 6 -
affidavit is to make the defendant and any other witnesses
accountable for their statements to the court.  The investigating
agents have asserted the relevant facts in a police incident
report and in a sworn affidavit.  The relevant case law requires
the same of the defendant.  There is no reasonable basis here to
excuse the defendant from satisfying the requirements for being
given an evidentiary hearing.
 
B.  The Traffic Stop 
The defendant argues that, contrary to the representations
by the investigating agents, he did not violate traffic
regulations. As discussed above, the defendant fails to make a
showing that there is a genuine dispute as to this factual issue. 
Task Force Agents have represented that they observed the
defendant roll through a stop sign and turn without first using a
turn signal.  “The decision to stop an automobile is reasonable
where the police have probable cause to believe that a traffic
violation has occurred.”  United States v. Harrell, 268 F.3d 141,
148 (2d. Cir. 2001) (quoting Whren v. United States, 517 U.S.
806, 810 (1996)).  See, e.g., Conn. Gen. Stat. §§14-242, 244 and
301.  Here, the records shows that the agents observed the
defendant commit traffic violations.
If a traffic stop is lawful, the driver and any passenger do
not have a Fourth Amendment interest in not being ordered out of
the stopped vehicle.  See Pennsylvania v. Mimms, 434 U.S. 106
- 7 -
(1977) (once vehicle is lawfully stopped, ordering driver out of
car is a de minimis intrusion and driver has no Fourth Amendment
interest in not being ordered out of car); Maryland v. Wilson,
519 U.S. 408 (1997) (passengers in lawfully stopped car have no
Fourth Amendment interest in not being ordered out of car). Once
the defendant’s vehicle was observed violating a traffic
regulation, the agents were authorized to stop the vehicle, order
the defendant to exit the vehicle and detain him for a reasonable
period of time so that the agents could further their
investigation.  
Here, it appears that when the defendant detected the
presence of the investigating agents, he put the vehicle in
reverse and began to search for an escape route.  As the agents
converged on his car, the defendant was observed stuffing
something down the back of his pants.  Based on these
observations, and considered in light of the fact that the
defendant had been described by a reliable informant as a small
time crack cocaine dealer, the agents had reasonable suspicion to
extend the duration of the detention and investigate further. 
The Fourth Amendment permits law enforcement officers to initiate
investigative stops when they have “reasonable suspicion,
supported by articulable facts that criminal activity ‘may be a
foot.’” United States v. Sokolow, 490 U.S. 1, 7 (1989) (quoting
Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 30 (1968); see also United States v.
- 8 -
Cortez, 449 U.S. 411, 417 (“An investigatory stop must be
justified by some objective manifestation that the person stopped
is, or is about to be, engaged in criminal activity.”).  “[T]he
level of suspicion required for a Terry stop is obviously less
demanding than that for probable cause.” Sokolow, 490 U.S. at 7
(citations omitted).   “Although an officer's reliance on a mere
‘hunch’ is insufficient to justify a stop, the likelihood of
criminal activity need not rise to the level required for
probable cause, and it falls considerably short of satisfying a
preponderance of the evidence standard.” United States v. Arvizu,
534 U.S. 266, 273-274 (2002) (citations omitted).
In determining whether the information possessed by a law
enforcement officer provided a sufficient basis for a stop, the
court is required to look at the totality of the circumstances. 
Arvizu, 534 U.S. at 273; Alabama v. White, 496 U.S. 325, 330
(1990).  “[T]he court must evaluate those circumstances ‘through
the eyes of a reasonable and cautious police officer on the
scene, guided by his experience and training.’” United States v.
Colon, 250 F.3d 130, 134 (2d Cir. 2001) (quoting United States v.
Bayless, 201 F.3d 16, 133 (2d Cir. 2000).  The “totality of the
circumstances” inquiry permits police officers to “make
inferences from and deductions about the cumulative information
available to them that might well elude an untrained person.” 
Arvizu, at 273 (quotations omitted). 
- 9 -
Here, the record shows that the traffic stop by the
investigating agents was supported by reasonable suspicion, as
was the extension of the duration of the detention and the
further investigation.
C. 
Search at 251 Nahum Drive.
The defendant argues that the search of the apartment he
shared with Marquila Alexander at 251 Nahum Drive was conducted
without consent.  He argues that he “believes” Alexander’s
consent was involuntary.  This is an equivocal and
unsubstantiated assertion that cannot justify either an
evidentiary hearing or suppression of the items seized from the
apartment.  Also, the defendant’s argument about fear of an
enhancement for obstruction of justice should he be found guilty
is not relevant here because an affidavit would be submitted by
Alexander, not by the defendant. 
In addition, Alexander’s written consent to a search of the
apartment flatly contradicts the defendant’s unsupported
assertion.  See Government’s Resp., Ex. B.  On the consent form,
Alexander represents that she was not “threatened, nor forced in
any way” and that she “freely consent[s] to this search.”  Id.
D. 
Defendant’s Statements During the Traffic Stop.
The defendant argues that he did not say to Burgos that he
had stuffed a small amount of crack cocaine down his pants, and
also that, in any event, he was not given Miranda warnings.  See
- 10 -
Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966).  Both of the arguments
by defense counsel are unsupported.
“Miranda warnings are required only where there has been
such a restriction on a person’s freedom as to render him ‘in
custody’.”  Oregon v. Mathiason, 429 U.S. 492, 495 (1977). 
“[T]he initial determination of custody depends on the objective
circumstances of the interrogation, not on the subjective views
harbored by either the interrogating officers or the persons
being questioned.”  Stansbury v. California, 511 U.S. 318, 323
(1994).  “[A] custodial setting is one providing ‘inherently
coercive pressures that tend to undermine the individual’s will
to resist and to compel him to speak.’” United States v.
Mitchell, 966 F.2d 92, 98 (2d Cir. 1992).    
The record at this point demonstrates that the defendant’s
admission to possessing crack cocaine was not in response to a
custodial interrogation.  As Burgos was conducting a pat down of
the defendant’s person, the defendant stated that he had stuffed
a small amount of crack cocaine down his pants and that he was
sorry.  Thus, the defendant’s statement was not in response to
any questioning by an investigating agent.  “The fundamental
import of the privilege while an individual is in custody is not
whether he is allowed to talk to the police without the benefit
of warnings and counsel, but whether he can be interrogated . . .
Volunteered statements of any kind are not barred by the Fifth
- 11 -
Amendment and their admissibility is not affected by our holding
today.”  Miranda, at 478.  
It is clear therefore that the special procedural
safeguards outlined in Miranda are required not where a
suspect is simply taken into custody, but rather where a
suspect in custody is subjected to interrogation.
‘Interrogation,’ as conceptualized in the Miranda
opinion, must reflect a measure of compulsion above and
beyond that inherent in custody itself.
 
Rhode Island v. Innis, 446 U.S. 291, 300 (1980).  Therefore, even
if the defendant was in custody for purpose of Miranda warnings,
the record as it now stands shows that the statement offered by
the defendant was not elicited during an interrogation.  
E. 
Defendant’s Post-Arrest Statement
The defendant also argues that his oral and written
statements to investigating agents following his arrest were
involuntary and were not preceded by Miranda warnings.  This
assertion by defense counsel is also unsupported.  The defendant
argues that the investigating agents told him that by providing a
statement, “he would save from a federal prosecution Marquila
Alexander and also save her child from DCF custody proceedings.”
Def.’s Br. 2.  However, the defendant’s written statement
contains his representation that he provided the statement
“voluntarily, without threat or promise made to me by anyone.  I
have been read my rights and I understand them.” Government’s
Resp., Ex. C.  In addition, the incident report states that
Special Agent Borysevicz advised the defendant of his Miranda
- 12 -
rights from a preprinted card, that the defendant acknowledged
that he understood his rights, and that this was witnessed by
Plourde.  See Government’s Resp., Ex. A at 4.  Based on the
record, the court concludes that the defendant’s post-arrest
statement was voluntary and preceded by Miranda warnings.  
III. CONCLUSION
For the reasons set forth above, Defendant’s Motion to
Suppress (Doc. No. 13) and Defendant’s Motion for a Hearing (Doc.
No. 14) are hereby DENIED.
It is so ordered.
Dated this 16th day of November 2006 at Hartford,
