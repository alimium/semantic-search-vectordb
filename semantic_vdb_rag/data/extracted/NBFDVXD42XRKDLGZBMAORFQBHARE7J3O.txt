Rep. Bilirakis Reminds Travelers of New Border Crossing Procedures
  Starting today, oral declarations of citizenship from U.S. and Canadian citizens will no longer
be allowed at land and sea border crossings.  Citizens from the U.S. and Canada will now have
to show proof of citizenship by presenting either: a &quot;trusted traveler&quot; document; a
passport; or government-issued photo identification such as a driver’s license, plus proof of
citizenship, such as a birth certificate.  
  
  Congressman Bilirakis says the more stringent requirements will help to fill a vulnerability gap
at America's border crossings.   
  
  &quot;The implementation of more stringent identification requirements at border crossings
was a deficiency raised by the 9/11 Commission and subsequently addressed by Congress in
2004,&quot; said Congressman Bilirakis. &quot;While it may take some time for all travelers
to be acclimated to the new rules, I have been assured that DHS will work hard to implement
these new regulations with flexibility and understanding, and that exceptions will continue to be
made for those who do not meet all of the new identification requirements. As a member of
Homeland Security Committee, which has oversight of this issue, I will continue to monitor the
progress of this transition very closely.&quot;  
  
  CBP Commissioner W. Ralph Basham says his agency will work with travelers and continue to
educate the public about these new changes.   
  
  “We feel that ultimately these changes will help create not only more secure borders, but more
efficient borders as well – whether at a land border port of entry or a seaport,&quot; said Comm
issioner Basham
.  &quot;We will be flexible in this phase, which is intended to raise awareness and help
travelers get adjusted to the changes, and we thank Congressman Bilirakis for his commitment
to also getting the message out.”  
  
  Locally, Port Director Wainio said he recognizes the challenges these new procedures may
pose to those traveling via the Port of Tampa, and says that the he and his staff will work to
assist all travelers as they adapt to these new changes.

  “The Port of Tampa is the largest economic engine in West Central Florida and one of the
most diversified ports in the nation.  Key to the Port’s success has been the strength of the
cruise industry,&quot; said Port Director Wainio.  &quot;The Port makes every effort to ensure
that visitors who are cruising from Tampa have a very positive experience while in our great
community.”
