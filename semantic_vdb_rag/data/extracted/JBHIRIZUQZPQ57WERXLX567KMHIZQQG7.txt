Standing for Veterans
  
Congressman Rooney meets with American Legion representatives from 
  
Florida to discuss TRICARE fees and reducing the VA claims backlog.
  
  
As an Army veteran and a member of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Veterans
Affairs, Congressman Rooney is dedicated to ensuring our service members and veterans

receive the benefits they have earned and deserve. 
  
Congressman Rooney has been a tireless advocate bringing awareness to the growing number
of troops and veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder, traumatic brain injury, depression,
and other invisible wounds. He has worked to improve mental health services, increase funding
for treatment, and expand access to licensed mental health professionals for TRICARE
beneficiaries. He has stood firm against increases in TRICARE fees for veterans and military
families, and has worked across the aisle to combat veteran homelessness.
  
One of Congressman Rooney’s top priorities for improving services for America’s veterans
reducing the disability claims backlog at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Despite more
than four years of promises from the Obama Administration to eliminate the backlog, the
situation has only grown worse. The number of unprocessed claims will soon reach one million,
and nearly all claims are still processed on paper, rather than online. Congressman Rooney
firmly believes this is unacceptable. He helped lead a bipartisan group of veterans in Congress
in writing a letter to President Obama urging him to take immediate action to reduce the
backlog
 and improve VA services.
  
Congressman Rooney firmly believes we have a moral obligation to care for those who served.
He will continue holding the VA accountable for providing the very best services possible for our
returning war fighters, their families and veterans.
