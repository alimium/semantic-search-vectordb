SOP No. 14 
 
Recommended Standard Operating Procedure 
for 
Gravimetric Calibration of Volumetric Standards Using an Electronic Balance 
  
 
1 
Introduction 
 
 
1.1 
Purpose of Test  
 
This procedure is a precision mass calibration converting mass values to 
volumetric values using pure water as a standard reference material. The results 
provide calibration of either the "to deliver" or "to contain" volume of measuring 
containers that may be used as volumetric measuring standards. The procedure 
uses gravimetric calibration principles to minimize calibration uncertainties. 
Accordingly, the procedure is especially useful for high accuracy calibrations. 
The procedure references measurement control standards to ensure the validity of 
the standards and the measurement process; however, additional good 
measurement practices such as those required for precision mass calibrations must 
be used. The procedure makes use of an electronic balance and is suitable for all 
sizes of gravimetric calibrations only limited by the capacity and resolution of the 
balance and handling capabilities. Standards that are calibrated for use in legal 
weights and measures applications should be evaluated for conformance to the 
appropriate specifications and tolerances that apply. This procedure calculates the 
average volume based on two runs. NOTE: NIST calibrations generally make use 
of the average of five replicates. 
 
1.2 
Prerequisites 
 
1.2.1 Verify that valid calibration certificates with appropriate values and 
uncertainties are available for all of the standards used in the calibration. 
All standards must have demonstrated metrological traceability to the 
international system of units (SI), which may be to the SI through a 
National Metrology Institute such as NIST. 
 
1.2.2 Verify that the mass standards to be used have sufficiently small standard 
uncertainties for the level of calibration. Reference mass standards should 
not be used for gravimetric calibration due to the risk of water 
contamination. Weights of ASTM Class 2 or 3 or OIML Class F1 or F2 are 
recommended for this procedure. Working standards of other classes are 
generally not designed to maintain adequate stability needed; however, 
corrections obtained within a few days of the volume calibration may 
provide adequate stability and may be used if the uncertainty is 
sufficiently small and the density is available for performing buoyancy 
corrections.

1.2.3 Verify that the balance used is in good operating condition with adequate 
capacity, sufficiently small resolution, and sufficiently small process 
standard deviation, as verified by a valid control chart or preliminary 
experiments using this procedure. NOTE:  standard deviations obtained 
from mass calibrations do not reflect the process repeatability of 
gravimetric calibrations; therefore process repeatability must be obtained 
using this procedure! The accuracy of the balance and weighing 
procedures should be evaluated to minimize potential bias in the 
measurement process.  
 
1.2.4 Verify that the operator is experienced in precision weighing techniques 
and has had specific training in SOP 2, SOP 4, SOP 29, GMP 3, GMP 10, 
and gravimetric calibrations. 
 
1.2.5 Verify that an adequate quality and supply of distilled or deionized water 
(see GLP 10) is available. Note: Do not use tap water for this procedure! 
 
1.2.6 Verify that air currents are minimized in the laboratory when weighing is 
performed. Verify that the laboratory facilities meet the following 
minimum conditions to enable meeting the expected uncertainty that is 
achievable with this procedure:

2.1 
Scope, Precision, Accuracy  
 
The procedure is applicable for the calibration of any size of measuring container 
that, when filled with water, will not overload the electronic balance used. 
Typical containers range in capacity from 1 mL to 20 L; however, this procedure 
is also applicable for larger provers provided that facility, equipment and 
standards meet the requirements in this SOP. When larger provers (e.g., 100 gal 
or more) are tested, also see the Test Notes in the Appendix. The procedure is 
generally only appropriate for micropipettes when additional evaporation 
corrections are made. The precision of calibration depends on the care exercised 
in adjusting the various volumes and strict adherence to the various steps of the 
procedure. The accuracy attainable depends on the ability of the operator to read 
and set the meniscus, uncertainties of the standard weights, the air buoyancy 
corrections, and thermal expansion corrections that are made.

2.2 
Summary 
 
The electronic balance used is calibrated by incorporating standard masses into 
the procedure. The volumetric vessel to be calibrated is then weighed dry or 
“wetted down,” depending on whether the calibration is to be made on a “To 
Contain” or “To Deliver” basis. The container is filled with pure water of known 
temperature and re-weighed. The difference in mass is used to calculate the 
capacity of the container at the nominal capacity and at various capacities when 
multiple neck graduations are present. Transfer vessels may be used for all 
procedures except for flasks and containers marked “To Contain” (TC).  
 
2.3 
Standards and Equipment Requirements 
 
2.3.1 An electronic balance having sufficient capacity to weigh the loaded 
vessel is required. The balance selection affects the potential measurement 
errors associated with this procedure. Prior to use and where available, it 
is recommended to use the adjust/calibrate feature on balances. Option A 
provides a single point calibration factor for the balance. In general, 
concerns are greater for balances or mass comparators larger than 5 kg due 
to corner loading errors, non-linearity, and repeatability over the range of 
use. Option B as described in the calculation section for larger volumes 
corrects for balance non-linearity in both the filled and empty/drained 
ranges of use. Option B will also likely be required on mass comparators 
that have multiple ranges. It also provides corrections for variations in air 
density that may occur over a longer weighing process on larger volumes. 
For all procedures in this SOP, the balance should be zeroed prior to each 
measurement to minimize possible effects due to balance drift. The 
sensitivity or resolution of the balance may be a limiting factor in the 
accuracy of the measurement. The resolution and repeatability must be 
smaller than the accepted uncertainty of the calibration. Linearity errors or 
additional uncertainties may need to be considered when the mass 
standards are slightly less than the volume or container being measured.  
 
2.3.2 Sufficient quantity of calibrated mass standards. Mass standards are 
selected so that they are slightly larger than the combined mass of the 
volume and container or transfer vessel that will be weighed. When 
summations of masses are used, the summation mass is used, and the 
“effective density” must be calculated, taking care not to use “average” 
density values.  
 
2.3.3 Thermometer with resolution and uncertainty less than 0.1 °C to 
determine water temperature. 
 
2.3.4 Thermometer with resolution and uncertainty less than 0.50 °C to 
determine air temperature. 1

2.3.5 Barometer with resolution and uncertainty less than 135 Pa (1 mm Hg) to 
determine air pressure.1 
 
2.3.6 Hygrometer with resolution and uncertainty less than 10  % to determine 
relative humidity.1  
 
2.3.7 Distilled or deionized water (See GLP 10) of sufficient quality and 
quantity for the calibration. Note: Do not use tap water for this procedure!  
 
2.3.8 Stopwatch or other suitable timing device (does not need to be calibrated.) 
 
2.4 
General Considerations 
 
2.4.1 Cleanliness checks 
 
Verify that all containers to be calibrated are clean as evidenced by 
uniform drainage of water. No water droplets should remain on any 
interior surface as the water drains from the container. A reproducible 
“wet-down” weight is evidence for cleanliness in cases where it is not 
possible to visually check for uniform drainage. Use GMP 6 or 7 to clean 
vessels as necessary. All glassware must be meticulously cleaned, prior to 
calibration. When clean, the walls will be uniformly wetted. Instructions 
for cleaning are given in GMP 6 and GMP 7. An exception is plastic ware, 
which will not be wetted. Follow manufacturer's instructions for cleaning 
such vessels. Do not use cleaning agents that will attack, discolor, or swell 
plastic ware. 
 
2.4.2 Use water that is thermally equilibrated with the laboratory environment. 
Equilibration can be achieved by storing the water in clean containers in 
the laboratory. It is important to use water that is equilibrated in the 
laboratory as much as possible to minimize potential calibration errors and 
convection currents during the calibration. Consider water to be 
equilibrated when within ± 5 °C of the laboratory temperature. 
 
2.4.3 Volumetric calibrations to a marked volume (graduation line) are critically 
dependent on the setting of a meniscus. See GMP 3 for guidance in 
reading a meniscus. 
 
2.4.4 Use GLP 13 as the procedure to dry any container to be calibrated on a 
“To Contain” basis. 
 
2.4.5 Wet down (not used for any container calibrated “To Contain”) 
 
For glassware and hand-held test measures: Fill the container to capacity 
with distilled or deionized water, then empty over a 30 s period while 
avoiding splashing. Drain for 10 s unless another drain time is specified. 
SOP 14  
 
 
 
Page 4 of 19 
January 2016 
(This is commonly called a “30 s pour, 10 s drain” emptying procedure.)  
A 30 s (± 5 s) pour followed by a 10 s drain, with the measure held 
between a 10 degree and 15 degree angle from vertical is required during 
calibration and use for glass flasks. A wet-down is not required for a 
transfer vessel that is used to weigh a delivered volume of water. 
 
For stationary provers: Fill the container to capacity with distilled or 
deionized water, then empty. Time the drain once the cessation of the 
main flow is complete for 30 s and close the valve. 
 
2.5 
Calibration Procedure for Burets 
 
2.5.1 Clamp the buret vertically on a support stand. Also clamp a plain glass test 
tube or beaker, large enough to hold a thermometer, in the vicinity of the 
buret. 
 
2.5.2 Fill the buret with water and test for absence of leaks from the tip and 
stopcock. Drain and fill several times to condition the buret. Fill when 
ready to test. 
 
2.5.3 Drain and record the delivery time, defined as the time of unrestricted 
flow from the zero mark to the lowest graduation mark with the stopcock 
fully open. 
 
2.5.4 Fill the buret slightly above the zero mark with temperature-equilibrated 
water and also fill the test tube that holds the thermometer. Record the 
water temperature. 
 
2.5.5 Set the meniscus on the zero mark and touch the tip with the wetted wall 
of a beaker to remove any excess water. The buret tip must be full. 
 
2.5.6 Measure and record the air temperature, air pressure, and relative 
humidity. 
 
2.5.7 Zero the balance and then place a known mass standard on the balance pan 
that is slightly larger than the filled capacity of the empty transfer vessel 
or flask when filled with water. Record the reading as O1.  
 
2.5.8 Zero the balance and then weigh an empty transfer vessel or flask 
including the stopper or cover to be used. Record as O2.  
 
 
2.5.9 Fully open the stopcock and discharge the contents of the buret into the 
previously weighed flask or transfer vessel. The tip of the buret should be 
in contact with the wall of the flask. When the level in the buret is within a 
few millimeters above the line being calibrated, slow the discharge and 
SOP 14  
 
 
 
Page 5 of 19

make an accurate setting. When the setting is completed, move the flask 
horizontally to break contact with the tip. Recheck the setting. 
 
2.5.10 Stopper (or cover) the filled transfer vessel or flask. Check to make sure 
that the outside of the transfer vessel or flask is not wet. Zero the balance 
and then weigh the filled transfer vessel or flask. Record the balance 
reading as O3. 
 
2.5.11 Measure and record the temperature of water in the container. 
 
2.5.12 Test the next interval in the same manner - from the zero mark to the next 
interval of test. 
 
2.5.13 For burets with a specified waiting time, empty as in 2.5.9 to within a few 
millimeters of the calibration mark. Pause for the specified waiting time 
(e.g., 10 s), then adjust the meniscus to the graduation line as in 2.5.9. 
 
2.5.14 Measure and record the air temperature, air pressure, and relative 
humidity. 
 
2.5.15 Make a duplicate determination for each interval (Run 2). 
 
2.5.16 Calculate the volume for each interval as described in Section 3, Option 
A. 
 
2.6 
Calibration Procedure for Pipets (One-Mark) 
 
2.6.1 Measure and record the air temperature, air pressure, and relative 
humidity. 
 
2.6.2 Zero the balance and then place a known mass standard on the balance pan 
that is slightly larger than the filled capacity of the empty transfer vessel 
or flask when filled with water. Record the reading as O1.  
 
2.6.3 Zero the balance and then weigh an empty transfer vessel or flask, 
including the stopper or cover that will be used. Record the balance 
reading as O2. 
 
2.6.4 Fill the pipet to the index mark and measure the delivery time with the tip 
in contact with the internal surface of a beaker (not the transfer vessel that 
will be used.) 
 
2.6.5 Refill the pipet by suction, slightly above the index line. Record the water 
temperature. Wipe tip with filter paper, then slowly lower level to the 
index line, using a stopcock or pinch clamp for fine control. The tip must

be in contact with the wetted wall of the beaker while this setting is being 
made. Do not remove any water remaining on tip at this time. 
 
2.6.6 Hold the pipet in a vertical position and deliver water into the previously 
weighed transfer vessel or flask, with the tip in contact with the inside 
wall or neck. 
 
2.6.7 After flow has ceased, wait two seconds then remove the pipet from 
contact with the flask. Check to make sure that the outside of the transfer 
vessel or flask is not wet.  
 
2.6.8 Stopper (or cover) the filled transfer vessel or flask. Zero the balance and 
then weigh the transfer vessel or flask. Record the balance reading as O3. 
 
2.6.9 Measure and record the temperature of water in the container. 
 
2.6.10 Measure and record the air temperature, air pressure, and relative 
humidity. 
 
2.6.11 Make a duplicate determination for the pipet (Run 2). 
 
2.6.12 Calculate the volume as described in Section 3, Option A. 
  
2.7 
Calibration of Flasks (To Contain) – Transfer vessel must not be used.  
 
2.7.1 Clean and dry the flask to be calibrated as described in GLP 13. Then 
stopper the flask. 
 
2.7.2 Measure and record the air temperature, air pressure, and relative 
humidity. 
 
2.7.3 Zero the balance and then place a known mass standard on the balance pan 
that is slightly larger than the filled capacity of the flask when filled with 
water. Record the reading as O1.  
 
2.7.4 Zero the balance and then weigh the dry flask including its stopper or 
cover. Record the balance reading as O2. 
 
2.7.5 Place an appropriate sized funnel in neck and fill the flask to just below 
the reference graduation while maneuvering the flask to wet the entire 
neck below the stopper. Let stand for two minutes then adjust the 
meniscus to the reference graduation line, taking care to avoid wetting the 
neck above the capacity graduation. 
 
2.7.6 Check that the outside surface of the flask, and its internal surface above 
the water level are dry, and that neither bubbles or foam are present in the 
water. Remove visible water droplets if needed with a laboratory wipe. 
SOP 14

Stopper or cover the flask.  
 
2.7.7 Zero the balance and then weigh the filled flask and its stopper or cover, 
and record the balance reading as O3. 
 
2.7.8 Measure and record the temperature of the water in the flask or other 
container. 
 
2.7.9 Measure and record the air temperature, air pressure, and relative 
humidity. 
 
2.7.10 Make a duplicate determination (Run 2) after drying the flask per GLP 13. 
 
2.7.11 Perform volume calculations as described in Section 3, Option A.  
 
2.8 
Calibration of Flasks (To Deliver) 
 
2.8.1 Clean but do not dry the flask to be calibrated. Condition the flask by 
filling and emptying the flask over a 30 s period by gradually inclining it 
to avoid splashing. When the main flow has ceased, hold the flask in a 
nearly vertical position for 10 seconds unless another drain time is 
specified, then touch off the drop of water adhering to the tip of the flask. 
 
2.8.2 Measure and record the air temperature, air pressure, and relative 
humidity. 
 
2.8.3 Zero the balance and then place a known mass standard on the balance pan 
that is slightly larger than the filled capacity of the flask when filled with 
water. Record the reading as O1.  
 
2.8.4 Zero the balance and then weigh the drained (empty) flask including its 
stopper or cover. Record the balance reading as O2. 
 
2.8.5 Fill the flask to just below the reference graduation. Let the flask stand for 
two minutes, then adjust the meniscus to the reference graduation line. Do 
not dry the inside of the flask above the graduation line, but take care to 
ensure that the outside of the flask is dry.  
 
2.8.6 Zero the balance and then weigh the filled vessel, with cap or stopper. 
Record the balance reading as O3. 
 
2.8.7 Measure and record the temperature of the water in the flask.

2.8.9 Make a duplicate determination (Run 2). 
 
2.8.10 Calculate the volume of the flask as described in Section 3, Option A. 
 
Note: The order of weighing the filled and drained flask in Section 2.8 may be reversed. In that 
case, the filled vessel is still weighed and recorded as O3, the flask is drained as in 2.8.1, and the 
properly drained vessel is weighed and recorded as O2. 
  
2.9 
Calibration of Other Volumetric Glassware  
 
2.9.1 Measuring Pipets (non-single-mark) – Calibrate in a manner similar to that 
used to calibrate burets (2.5). 
 
2.9.2 Graduated Cylinders – Calibrate in a manner similar to that used for flasks 
(To Deliver cylinders, use section 2.8; To Contain cylinders, use section 
2.7). 
 
2.10 
Calibration of Slicker-Plate Type Standards  
 
2.10.1 This calibration makes use of Option B where equivalent mass standards 
are used at both the filled and empty loads on the balance. A transfer 
vessel is recommended. 
 
2.10.2 Condition the slicker-plate type standards with several wet-down runs to 
fully ensure wet down and smooth valve operation. 
 
2.10.3 Measure and record the air temperature, air pressure, and relative 
humidity. 
 
2.10.4 Zero the balance and then place a standard mass, MS1, on the balance 
platform (MS1 should be slightly larger than the mass of the drained 
vessel, dry vessel, or empty transfer vessel.)  Record reading as O1. 
 
2.10.5 Zero the balance. Place the dry or “wet-down” transfer vessel on the 
balance platform, as appropriate, and record reading as O2. Caution:  all 
containers must be dry on the outside for all weighing. 
 
2.10.6 Fill the slicker-plate standard to just above the rim of the standard. Record 
the water temperature. Slide the slicker plate across the level top. Set the 
transfer vessel below the nozzle to ensure all volume is transferred into the 
vessel and that no splashing occurs.  
 
2.10.7 Open the slicker-plate standard valve and remove the plate simultaneously 
and smoothly to deliver the water into the transfer vessel. Time the drain 
for 30 s after cessation of the main flow and close the valve. Cover the 
transfer vessel and move it from beneath the standard to ensure additional 
SOP 14  
 
 
 
Page 9 of 19 
January 2016 
drops of water are not transferred. Note: never fill the transfer vessel while 
it is sitting on the balance platform to ensure that the balance is not 
damaged with water and to avoid errors associated with balance drift and 
hysteresis. 
 
2.10.8 Zero the balance and then place a standard mass, MS2, on the balance 
platform (MS2 should be slightly larger than the mass of the filled vessel.)  
Record the balance reading as O3. 
 
2.10.9 Zero the balance and then weigh the filled transfer vessel and record the 
balance reading as O4.  
 
2.10.10 Immediately after weighing, check the temperature of the water in the 
filled container. Ensure that the water has not changed by more than 
0.2 °C during the measurement process or repeat the run. 
 
2.10.11 Measure and record the air temperature, barometric pressure, and relative 
humidity. 
 
2.10.12 Make a duplicate determination (Run 2). 
 
2.10.13 Calculate the volume as described in Section 3, Option B. 
 
2.11 
Calibration of Hand-held Graduated Neck Type Provers 
 
2.11.1 A hand-held test measure is weighed empty and filled much like the 
procedure for To Deliver flasks (section 2.8). However, this calibration 
makes use of Option B where equivalent mass standards are used at both 
the filled and empty loads on the balance. 
 
2.11.2 Condition the test measure by filling and draining using a 30 s pour 
followed by a 10 s drain. Take care to avoid splashing of water on the 
outside of the measure. The wet-down will help equilibrate the test 
measure with the water temperature. 
 
2.11.3 Measure and record the air temperature, air pressure, and relative 
humidity. 
 
2.11.4 Zero the balance and then place standard masses, MS1, on the balance 
platform (MS1 should be slightly larger than the mass of the drained 
vessel.)  Record reading as O1.  
 
2.11.5 Zero the balance and then place the “wet-down” test measure on the 
balance platform, and record the balance reading as O2. Caution:  all 
containers must be dry on the outside for all weighing. 
 
SOP 14

2.11.6 Fill the graduated neck type test measure to just below the nominal 
volume mark. Record the water temperature. Adjust the meniscus to 
nominal.  
 
2.11.7 Zero the balance and then place standard masses, MS2, on the balance 
platform (MS2 should be slightly larger than the mass of the filled vessel.)  
Record the balance reading as O3. 
 
2.11.8 Zero the balance and then weigh the filled transfer vessel and record the 
balance reading as O4.  
 
2.11.9 Immediately after weighing, check the temperature of the water in the 
filled container. Ensure that the water has not changed by more than 
0.2 °C since step 2.11.6 or repeat the run. 
 
2.11.10 Measure and record the air temperature, barometric pressure, and relative 
humidity. 
 
2.11.11 Make a duplicate determination (Run 2). 
 
2.11.12 Calculate the volume as described in Section 3, Option B. You may use 
the average water temperature in calculations. If a neck scale plate 
verification is performed, additional weighings may be performed after 
setting the meniscus at each level.  
 
2.12 
Calibration of Large Volume Graduated Neck Type Provers 
 
2.12.1 This calibration makes use of Option B where approximately equivalent 
mass standards are used at both the filled and empty loads on the balance. 
A transfer vessel is recommended. The unknown vessel to be calibrated 
must be elevated to facilitate transfer of water into the transfer vessel. 
 
2.12.2 Condition the prover with a wet-down run to fully ensure smooth valve 
operation, temperature equilibration, and wet-down of the delivery system. 
 
2.12.3 Measure and record the air temperature, air pressure, and relative 
humidity. 
 
2.12.4 Zero the balance and then place standard masses, MS1, on the balance 
platform (MS1 should be slightly larger than the mass of the drained 
vessel, dry vessel, or empty transfer vessel.)  Record reading as O1.  
 
2.12.5 Zero the balance. Place dry or “wet-down” transfer vessel including cover 
on balance platform, as appropriate, and record reading as O2. Caution:  
all containers must be dry on the outside for all weighing. 
 
SOP 14

2.12.6 Fill the graduated neck type prover to just below the nominal volume 
mark. Record the water temperature. Adjust the meniscus to nominal. Set 
the transfer vessel below the nozzle to ensure all volume is transferred into 
the vessel and that no splashing occurs. Use hoses and piping of minimum 
length to avoid errors associated with retention during delivery. Hoses 
should be translucent so that cessation of the main flow is visible. Care 
should be taken to ensure that there are no loops or sags in the hose that 
may hold water. When using hoses or piping, be sure to include them as 
part of the wet-down process.  
 
2.12.7 Open the unknown prover valve to deliver the water into the transfer 
vessel. Time the drain for 30 s after the cessation of the main flow and 
close the valve. Cover the transfer vessel and move it from beneath the 
prover to ensure additional drops of water are not transferred. 
 
2.12.8 Zero the balance and then place standard masses, MS2, on the balance 
platform (MS2 should be slightly larger than the mass of the filled vessel.)  
Record the balance reading as O3. 
 
2.12.9 Zero the balance and then weigh the filled transfer vessel and its cover. 
Record the balance reading as O4.  
 
2.12.10 Immediately after weighing, check the temperature of the water in the 
filled container. The temperature should not change by more than 0.2 °C if 
the prover and water have been equilibrated in the laboratory 
environment.  
 
2.12.11 Measure and record the air temperature, barometric pressure, and relative 
humidity. 
 
2.12.12 Make a duplicate determination (Run 2). 
 
2.12.13 Calculate the volume as described in Section 3, Option B. You may use 
the average water temperatures for calculations.

Calculate and report the mean volume of the volumetric standard at its applicable 
reference temperature.   
 
If adjustments were made during replicate runs, report the “as found” volume or 
the mean of “as found” volumes and also the “as left” volume or mean of “as left” 
volumes, as applicable, at the appropriate reference temperature. (I.e., do not 
calculate a mean value by combining “as found” and “as left” values when 
adjustments are made.)

Measurement Assurance 
 
4.1 
Duplicate the process with a suitable check standard (See GLP 1, SOP 30, in 
NISTIR 6969, or Sec. 7.4, in NBS Handbook 145) or conduct replicate 
measurements per SOP 17 or 20. Average values of the range or standard 
deviation of similarly sized flasks or volumetric standards may be tracked on a 
single range chart or standard deviation chart according to SOP 17 or 20. For 
standards that may be and are adjusted, do not combine an “as found” value with 
an “as left” value for the two runs entered into the chart; use the adjusted value 
from Run 1 and the value from Run 2, both at the applicable reference 
temperature, when entering values in a standard deviation or range chart. Control 
chart run values must both be from either before adjustment or after adjustment.  
A minimum of 12 replicate measurements are required to establish initial process 
limits and 25 to 30 points are required for reporting valid uncertainty values.  
 
4.2 
Plot the calculated check standard volume and verify it is within established 
limits. A t-test may be incorporated to check the observed value against an 
accepted value. 
 
4.3 
The mean of the calculated check standard values is used to evaluate bias and 
drift over time and may be used to identify or signify problems with the volume 
standard or changes in water quality.

4.4 
Check standard observations are used to calculate the standard deviation of the 
measurement process, sp.

Assignment of Uncertainties 
 
The limits of expanded uncertainty, U, include estimates of the standard uncertainty of 
the mass standards used, uc, plus the measurement process repeatability, sp, and the 
additional items noted below and in the uncertainty budget table,  Table 3, at 
approximately a 95 percent level of confidence. See SOP 29 for the complete standard 
operating procedure for calculating the uncertainty.  
 
5.1 
The standard uncertainty for the standards, us, is obtained from the calibration 
report. The combined standard uncertainty, uc,  is used and not the expanded 
uncertainty, U, therefore the reported uncertainty for the standard will usually 
need to be divided by the coverage factor k. Multiple mass standards are often 
used, so see SOP 29 for treatment of dependencies and correlations. 
 
5.2   
Standard deviation of the measurement process from control chart performance 
(See SOP No. 17 or 20.) 
 
  
 
The value for sp is obtained from the control chart data for check standards when 
a check standard is available using this procedure. It may also be estimated based 
on replicate measurements over time. Replicate measurements over time may 
provide a pooled standard deviation that may be used or the average range is used 
to estimate the standard deviation per SOP 17 or 20. This standard deviation value 
is a repeatability factor related to the precision of the weighings and the setting of 
the meniscus when present, but does not include uncertainties associated with 
errors in reading the meniscus (See GMP 3.) 
 
5.3 
Include uncertainties associated with the reading of the meniscus when one is 
present. See GMP 3 for details.  
 
5.4 
Other standard uncertainties usually included at this calibration level include 
uncertainties associated with water temperature measurements, thermometer 
accuracy, calculation of air density, standard uncertainties associated with the 
density of the mass standards, coefficients of expansion, viscosity or surface 
effects on the volume of liquid clinging to vessel walls after draining, improper 
observance of drainage times, and the lack of internal cleanliness. 
 
5.5 
Example components to be considered for an uncertainty budget table are shown 
in Table 3. Multiple values may need to be considered in some cases.

Test Notes for Large Provers 
 
1 
Pour and drain times. 
 
It is impractical to completely drain a filled container, because some of the contents will 
remain as a film. By strict adherence to a specified procedure, the residual contents can 
be held essentially constant so that, reproducible calibration constants can be obtained. 
The conventionally selected conditions are as follows: 
 
a. 
For bottom-drain containers: open drain valve fully and allow contents to 
discharge at maximum rate. When flow ceases, wait 30 s, close valve, and touch 
off any drops adhering to spout.  
  
 
b. 
For pour-type containers: pour contents by gradually tilting container to an 85º 
angle, so that virtually all liquid is delivered in 30 s. Allow to drain for an 
additional 10 s, then touch off any drops adhering to the lip.  
  
The instructions described above must be precisely followed during calibration and use 
of the calibrated vessels. 
  
2 
Evaporation losses. 
 
A suitable cap should be placed on the top of open vessels to minimize evaporation 
losses. If used, the cap must be included in all weighings. 
  
3 
Slicker-plate. 
 
 
 
When a slicker-plate standard is calibrated, the plate should be used to fix the water level 
in it. A transfer vessel is recommended for use when calibrating a slicker-plate type 
standard. But if the standard is weighed, the plate must be weighed with the standard 
during each such operation.
