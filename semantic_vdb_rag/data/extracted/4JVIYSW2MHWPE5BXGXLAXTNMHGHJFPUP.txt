SECURITY FACT 
SHEET 
2006 
IDAHO DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY, WASTEWATER PROGRAM 
Wastewater Security is Focus of GAO-05-165 Report 
In a recent report to the Senate 
Committee on Environment and 
Public Works, the Government Ac-
countability Office (GAO) pre-
sented the results of a survey con-
ducted among fifty wastewater ex-
perts nationwide who were asked 
to answer the following questions: 
• What is the best method 
to distribute federal 
funds?  
 
(See page 2) 
The results of the survey 
are presented in the follow-
ing, starting immediately 
below and continuing on 
through page 2. 
How can waste water security be 
enhanced? 
• Which wastewater assets  are 
most vulnerable to terrorist at-
tacks?  
(See below) 
To get a copy of GAO-05-165, “Wastewater Facilities: Expert’s Views on 
How Federal Funds Should be Spent to Improve Security,” go to  
http://www.gao.gov/ and enter GAO-05-165 in the search box.  
Then click Go. 
• What security enhancing actions 
are most deserving of federal 
support?  
 
(See page 2) 
• What criteria should be used for 
determining those utilities having 
the highest priority for federal 
funding to improve security? 
 
(See page 2) 
The Five Most Vulnerable Wastewater Assets 
Fifty experts asked 
to identify 
wastewater assets 
that are the most 
vulnerable to 
security threats 
picked the following: 
1 
Collection system’s network of sewers (42 votes) 
2 
Treatment chemicals (32 votes) 
3 
Key components of the treatment plant, such as the headworks (29 
votes) 
4 
Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems (18) 
5 
Pumping stations (16) 
The Idaho National Laboratory (INL) maintains a SCADA test bed for conducting research aimed at enhancing utility infra-
structures, making systems less susceptible to attacks.  For more information on the INL test bed, go to:

WASTEWATER SECURITY FACT SHEET 
Security-Enhancing Activities Deserving Federal Support 
1 
Replacing gaseous chemicals used in wastewater 
treatment with less hazardous alternatives (29 
votes) 
2 
Improving local, state, and regional collaboration 
efforts (23 votes) 
3 
Completing vulnerability assessments for individual 
wastewater systems (20 votes) 
When asked to pick 
those security-
enhancing activities 
most deserving of fed-
eral support, the sur-
vey of experts polled 
for GAO-05-165 cited 
the following: 
How do wastewater experts think 
security can be enhanced and 
funded? Source: GAO-05-165. 
TWENTY-NINE OF FIFTY EXPERTS SURVEYED RATED THE REPLACEMENT OF GASEOUS CHEMICALS WITH LESS HAZARDOUS 
ALTERNATIVES TO BE THE HIGHEST PRIORITY FOR FEDERAL FUNDING. 
Who Should Get Federal Funds? 
CWSRF Programs: 
More than $40 Billion 
In Low-Interest Loans 
1 
Utilities serving critical infrastructure (39 
votes) 
2 
Utilities using large quantities of gaseous 
chemicals (26 votes) 
3 
Utilities serving large populations (24 votes) 
When asked which utilities 
should get top priority for fed-
eral funds to enhance the se-
curity of wastewater systems, 
the panel of fifty experts cited 
the following criteria most fre-
quently: 
How Should Federal Funds be Distributed? 
1 
Direct grants (34 votes) 
2 
Clean Water State Revolving Fund  
(5 votes) 
3 
Loans or loan guarantees (1 vote) 
EPA’s Clean Water State 
Revolving Fund (CWSRF) 
program has provided more than 
14,000 low-interest loans for 
“water quality protection projects 
for wastewater treatment, 
nonpoint source pollution control, 
and watershed and estuary 
management.” 
 
“CWSRFs offer: 
• 
Low interest rates, flexible 
terms 
• 
Significant funding for 
nonpoint source pollution 
control and estuary 
protection 
• 
Assistance to a variety of 
borrowers 
• 
Partnerships with other 
funding sources”

mechanisms for distributing fed-
eral funds to be used to enhance 
wastewater security, the fifty ex-
perts chose the following:

A Message from the Wastewater Program Manager 
In this wastewater fact sheet, the focus is on security, starting with the findings of GAO-05-165 and continu-
ing through some other compelling wastewater security related suggestions and recommendations of merit.  
In an era in which terrorism remains a major threat to the security of our country’s infrastructure, including
