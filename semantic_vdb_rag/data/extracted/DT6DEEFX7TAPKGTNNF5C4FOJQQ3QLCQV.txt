SECTION 1.  Whereas, in recent years, a number of companies
have replaced highly skilled workers in the commonwealth with
lower-paid foreign workers, a practice commonly known as off-
shore outsourcing; whereas, such off-shore outsourcing trends are
occurring during a period of significant job loss in the common-
wealth; whereas, white-collar occupations, including technology
and computer specialists, financial analysts, accountants, office
support workers, and call center employees are among those occu-
pations most vulnerable to off-shore outsourcing; whereas, the
preservation of jobs in the commonwealth is of the utmost impor-
tance to the economic health of the commonwealth; the economic
dislocation caused by a company off-shore outsourcing jobs out-
side of the commonwealth and the United States poses a threat of
harm to the health, safety and welfare of the residents of the com-
monwealth; therefore there is an immediate need to establish a

special commission to study the effects of off-shore outsourcing
on the commonwealth and its residents and possible legislation to
address and mitigate the effects of off-shore outsourcing and to
govern contracts between the commonwealth and its vendors.
