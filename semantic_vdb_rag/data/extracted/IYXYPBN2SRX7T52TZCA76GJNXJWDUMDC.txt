COMMITTEE ENDS TWO INEFFECTIVE PROGRAMS AND STOPS THE SPENDING OF $30 BILLION
WASHINGTON (March 10) – The House Financial Services Committee, chaired by
Congressman Spencer Bachus (AL-6), approved legislation on Wednesday that ends two
ineffective government spending programs. The bills, which terminate the troubled Home
Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) and the Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP),
prevent more than $30 billion in additional spending on the programs.
      
Approval by the Committee moves the bills forward for consideration by the House.
  
Financial Services Committee Chairman Bachus said, “The American people sent us here
to tell them the truth, and the truth is our country is in serious trouble because of excessive
government spending.  We are on an unsustainable path that will lead to ruin, that will lead to a
diminished standard of living for our children and grandchildren, and that will reduce the
greatness of our country.  We must take action immediately to change course and put a stop to
this reckless culture of spending that has ruled Washington for far too long.”
  
 The Financial Services Committee approved the following two bills:
  
 H.R. 839, the HAMP Termination Act
  
H.R. 839, introduced by Rep. Patrick McHenry (NC), terminates Treasury’s authority to provide
new assistance under HAMP while preserving the contracts made prior to the bill’s enactment.
H.R. 839 prevents $29 billion in TARP funds from being spent to continue this ineffective
program. Far from helping at-risk homeowners, HAMP has actually put many struggling
homeowners in worse financial shape.  As the Special Inspector General for TARP (SIGTARP),
Neil Barofsky, reported in testimony to a subcommittee, HAMP “benefits only a small portion of
distressed homeowners, offers others little more than false hope, and in certain cases causes
more harm than good.” 
  
Rep. McHenry said, “The Home Affordable Modification Program, or HAMP, was created to
stave off the foreclosure crisis and aid troubled borrowers.  But here we are two years later and
all who investigate, analyze, or survey this program conclude that it is an epic failure.  The

government is offering false hope to hundreds of thousands Americans, and it just can’t deliver.”
  
HAMP was announced by the Administration in February 2009 and $30 billion in TARP dollars
were set aside for HAMP. The Administration claimed HAMP would help up to 4 million
homeowners. Instead, only 521,630 loans have been permanently modified and the re-default
rate is high. From the $30 billion earmarked for HAMP only $840 million has gone out the door.
There is widespread criticism that HAMP is not working and is only making matters worse for
many of the homeowners who participate or seek to participate. In addition to the SIGTARP, the
Congressional Oversight Panel and the Government Accountability Office have detailed
problems with HAMP.
  
H.R. 861, the NSP Termination Act
  
H.R. 861, introduced by Rep. Gary Miller (CA), terminates the NSP and prevents an additional
$1 billion from being spent on this program, which has already consumed nearly $6 billion. The
NSP does nothing to help struggling homeowners stay in their homes.  Instead, it allows lenders
and real estate speculators to off-load their foreclosed properties onto the taxpayers.
  
The Inspector General for the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has
identified multiple cases of misuse of NSP funds, and the Government Accountability Office has
said HUD does not have proper tools in place to keep track of uses of the funds.
  
Subcommittee Chairman Miller said, “I am pleased the Committee has voted to terminate the
Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP). We have little to show for the nearly $6 billion of the
taxpayers’ money that was spent on this ineffective program.  NSP was inefficient and it did not
target resources to those areas with the most need.  Even worse, there was no requirement for
repayment of the allocated funds.  At a time when the national debt has surpassed $14 trillion
and the federal government is borrowing 40 cents for each dollar spent, it is imperative that we
stop wasting taxpayer dollars on such ineffective and unaccountable government programs.
The best way to address the foreclosure crisis and stabilize communities is to get our economy
back on track.”
