Turf Valley Villages Phase 1 and 3 
(Voluntary Cleanup Program) 
 
Site Description: 
 
This 30.95-acre parcel, a subdivision of the Turf Valley Golf Course and Resort, is located at 2700 Turf 
Valley Road, Ellicott City, Howard County, Maryland.  The property is bordered to the north and west by 
remaining acres of the Turf Valley Golf Course and Resort, beyond which to the east are single-family 
residences.  Bordering the property to the south is the maintenance area of the Turf Valley resort, and to the 
east is Interstate 70. 
 
The property is located in a groundwater use area of Howard County and groundwater flow beneath the 
property is to the south.  The closest potable water supply wells located within a 0.5-mile radius of the 
property are to the west on the remaining acres of the Turf Valley Golf Course and Resort.  The property is 
improved with three out-of-play golf hole complexes.   
 
Site History:  
 
Land title records indicate private ownership of the property until 1996, when the current owners, Mangione 
Enterprises of Turf Valley Limited Partnership, acquired the property.  The property was utilized as 
agricultural land until 1952, and as a golf course between 1990 and 2002.  The property currently consists of 
woods, dense vegetation and out-of-play golf hole complexes with associated asphalt paved golf cart paths.   
 
Environmental Investigations and Actions: 
 
Several environmental investigations have been performed at the property.  Phase I environmental site 
assessments (ESAs) were conducted at the property in March 2005 and September 2007, which identified 
nuisance debris piles on the property.   
 
In August 2004, a Phase II ESA was completed at the property which included the analysis of surface soil 
samples from the golf course features on site for arsenic, lead mercury and pesticides.  The analytical results 
from the samples collected from the existing tees, greens and fairways identified arsenic, mercury and lead at 
the property. 
 
In May 2005, soil samples were collected at the property that identified lead and arsenic in the surface soil 
located on site.  Between November 2005 and January 2006, areas on the Phase 1 portion of the property 
were excavated.  Soil samples were collected in the excavated areas located at the property.  The analytical 
results of the soil samples collected indicated the presence of metals at the property at concentrations below 
the Maryland Department of the Environment’s (MDE’s) Cleanup Standards for Soil and Groundwater. 
 
Between October 2009 and December 2009, an additional environmental investigation, which included the 
collection of groundwater and additional soil samples, was performed at the property.  The analytical results 
of the groundwater samples collected at the property indicated the presence of metals at concentrations 
below the Environmental Protection Agency’s maximum contaminant levels for all identified compounds.

The soil analytical results identified the presence of metals, including elemental mercury, pesticides and 
semi-volatile organic compounds in the surface and subsurface soils on site. 
 
In March 2010, mercury vapor samples were collected at the property in order to evaluate whether the 
concentrations of elemental mercury present in the surficial soils at the property posed a risk from vapor 
intrusion to indoor air.  Based on the analytical results of the mercury vapor samples collected at the 
property, the Department determined that the concentrations of elemental mercury in the surficial soil did not 
pose a vapor intrusion to indoor air risk at the site. 
 
Current Status: 
 
Two entities, Mangione Enterprises of Turf Valley, Limited Partnership and Villages at Turf Valley LLC 
submitted Voluntary Cleanup Program (VCP) applications for the property on October 20, 2008, seeking a 
No Further Requirement Determination (NFRD).  During the review of the application package and all 
additional documents, the Department determined that the property did not qualify for a NFRD, and required 
the submittal of a Response Action Plan (RAP).   
 
On February 19, 2010, the Department accepted the VCP application submitted by Mangione Enterprises of 
Turf Valley, Limited Partnership and Villages at Turf Valley LLC for the Turf Valley Villages Phase 1 and 3 
property into the VCP and requested the development of a proposed RAP in order to address potential risks 
associated with the property.  The Department is currently awaiting the submittal of the proposed RAP for 
the property.
