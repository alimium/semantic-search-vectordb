ANNOUNCEMENT AND REPORT  
CONCERNING  
ADVANCE PRICING AGREEMENTS 
 
 
March 31, 2003  
 
 
This Announcement is issued pursuant to § 521(b) of Pub. L. 106-170, the Ticket to Work and 
Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999, requiring that the Secretary of the Treasury annually 
report to the public concerning Advance Pricing Agreements (APAs) and the APA Program.  
The first report covered calendar years 1991 through 1999.  Subsequent reports covered calendar 
years 2000 and 2001.  This fourth report describes the experience of the APA Program during 
calendar year 2002 consistent with the mandate of § 521(b).  This document does not provide 
guidance regarding the application of the arm’s length standard; rather, it reports on the structure 
and activities of the APA program. 
 
 
Mindy Piatoff 
Acting Director, Advance Pricing Agreement Program 
 
 
 
Background 
 
Internal Revenue Code (IRC) § 482 provides that the Secretary may distribute, apportion, or 
allocate gross income, deductions, credits, or allowances between or among two or more 
commonly controlled businesses if necessary to reflect clearly the income of such businesses.  
Under the regulations, the standard to be applied in determining the true taxable income of a 
controlled business is that of a business dealing at arm’s length with an unrelated business. The 
arm’s length standard also has been adopted by the international community and is incorporated 
into the transfer pricing guidelines issued by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and 
Development (OECD).  OECD, TRANSFER PRICING GUIDELINES FOR MULTINATIONAL 
ENTERPRISES AND TAX ADMINISTRATORS (1995).  Transfer pricing issues by their nature are 
highly factual and have traditionally been one of the largest issues identified by the IRS in its 
audits of multinational corporations.  The APA Program is designed to resolve actual or potential 
transfer pricing disputes in a principled, cooperative manner, as an alternative to the traditional 
examination process.  An APA is a binding contract between the IRS and a taxpayer by which 
the IRS agrees not to seek a transfer pricing adjustment under IRC § 482 for a covered 
transaction if the taxpayer files its tax return for a covered year consistent with the agreed 
transfer pricing method (TPM).  In year 2002, the IRS and taxpayers executed 85 APAs and 
amended 9 APAs. 
 
Since 1991, with the issuance of Rev. Proc. 91-22, 1991-1 C.B. 526, the IRS has offered 
taxpayers through the APA Program the opportunity to reach an agreement in advance of filing a 
 
 
1 
tax return on the appropriate TPM to be applied to related party transactions.  In 1996, the IRS 
issued internal procedures for processing APA requests.  Chief Counsel Directives Manual 
(CCDM), ¶¶ 42.10.10 – 42.10.16 (November 15, 1996).  Also in 1996, the IRS updated Rev. 
Proc. 91-22 with the release of Rev. Proc. 96-53, 1996-2 C.B. 375.  The APA Program continues 
to operate under the provisions of Rev. Proc. 96-53, which provides taxpayers with instructions 
of how to apply for an APA, and what to expect in the processing of the case.  In addition, in 
1998, the IRS published Notice 98-65, 1998-2 C.B. 803, which set forth streamlined APA 
procedures for Small Business Taxpayers (SBTs).  That Notice also expanded the availability of 
the lowest APA user fee in an effort to attract taxpayers who may not have the resources to do 
the sophisticated economic studies normally required in APA submissions.  
 
Advance Pricing Agreements 
 
An APA generally combines an agreement between a taxpayer and the IRS on an appropriate 
TPM for the transactions at issue (Covered Transactions) with an agreement between the U.S. 
and one or more foreign tax authorities (under the authority of the mutual agreement process of 
our income tax treaties) that the TPM is correct. With such a “bilateral” APA, the taxpayer 
ordinarily is assured that the income associated with the Covered Transactions will not be subject 
to double taxation by the IRS and the foreign tax authority.  It is the policy of the United States, 
as reflected in § 7 of Rev. Proc. 96-53 to encourage taxpayers that enter the APA program to 
seek bilateral or multilateral APAs when competent authority procedures are available with 
respect to the foreign country or countries involved.  However, the IRS may execute an APA 
with a taxpayer without reaching a competent authority agreement (a “unilateral” APA). 
 
A unilateral APA is an agreement between a taxpayer and the IRS establishing an approved TPM 
for U.S. tax purposes.  A unilateral APA binds the taxpayer and the IRS, but obviously does not 
prevent foreign tax administrations from taking different positions on the appropriate TPM for a 
transaction.  As stated in Rev. Proc. 96-53, should a transaction covered by a unilateral APA be 
subject to double taxation as the result of an adjustment by a foreign tax administration, the 
taxpayer may seek relief by requesting that the U.S. Competent Authority consider initiating a 
mutual agreement proceeding, provided there is an applicable income tax treaty in force with the 
other country. 
 
When a unilateral APA involves taxpayers operating in a country that is a treaty partner, 
information relevant to the APA (including a copy of the APA and APA annual reports) may be 
provided to the treaty partner under normal rules and principles governing the exchange of 
information under income tax treaties. 
 
The APA Program 
 
APAs are negotiated with the taxpayer by an IRS team headed by an APA team leader.  As of 
December 31, 2002, the APA program had 17 team leaders.  The team leader is responsible for 
organizing the IRS APA team.  The IRS APA team arranges meetings with the taxpayer, secures 
whatever information is necessary from the taxpayer to analyze the taxpayer’s related party 
transactions and the available facts under the arm’s length standard of IRC § 482 and the 
regulations thereunder (Treas. Reg.), and negotiates with the taxpayer. 
 
 
2 
 
The APA team generally includes an economist, an international examiner, LMSB field counsel, 
and, in a bilateral case, a U.S. Competent Authority analyst who leads the discussions with the 
treaty partner. The economist may be from the APA Program or the IRS field organization.  As 
of December 31, 2002, the APA Program had 7 economists.  The APA team may also include an 
LMSB International Technical Advisor, other LMSB exam personnel, and an Appeals officer. 
 
 
The APA Process 
 
The APA process is voluntary.  Taxpayers submit an application for an APA, together with a 
user fee as set forth in Rev. Proc. 96-53.  The APA process can be broken into five phases:  (1) 
application; (2) due diligence; (3) analysis; (4) discussion and agreement; and (5) drafting, 
review, and execution. 
 
(1) 
Application 
 
In many APA cases, the taxpayer’s application is preceded by a pre-file conference with the APA 
staff in which the taxpayer can solicit the informal views of the APA Program.  Pre-file 
conferences can occur on an anonymous basis, although a taxpayer must disclose its identity 
when it applies for an APA.  Taxpayers must file the appropriate user fee on or before the due 
date of the tax return for the first taxable year that the taxpayer proposes to be covered by the 
APA.  Many taxpayers file a user fee first and then follow up with a full application later.  The 
procedures for pre-file conferences, user fees, and delayed applications can be found in Rev. 
Proc. 96-53. 
 
The APA application can be a relatively modest document for a small business taxpayer.  Notice 
98-65 describes the special APA procedures for small businesses.  For most taxpayers, however, 
the APA application is a substantial document filling several binders. The APA Program makes 
every effort to reach agreement on the basis of the information provided in the taxpayer's 
application. 
  
The application is assigned to an APA team leader who is responsible for the case.  The APA 
team leader’s first responsibility is to organize the APA team.  This involves contacting the 
appropriate LMSB International Territory Manager to secure the assignment of an international 
examiner to the APA case and the LMSB Counsel’s office to secure a field counsel lawyer.   In a 
bilateral case, the U.S. Competent Authority will assign a U.S. Competent Authority analyst to 
the team.   In a large APA case, the international examiner may invite his or her manager and 
other LMSB personnel familiar with the taxpayer to join the team.  When the APA may affect 
taxable years in Appeals, the appropriate appellate conferee will be invited to join the team.  In 
all cases, the team leader contacts the Manager, LMSB International Technical Advisors, to 
determine whether to include a technical advisor on the team.  The IRS APA team will generally 
include a technical advisor if the APA request concerns cost-sharing, intangibles or services. The 
APA team leader then distributes copies of the APA application to all team members and sets up 
an opening conference with the taxpayer.  The APA office strives to hold this opening 
conference within 45 days of the assignment of the case to a team leader.  At the opening 
 
 
3 
conference, the APA team leader proposes a case plan designed to complete the recommended 
U.S. negotiating position for a bilateral APA within 9 months from the date the full application 
was filed and to complete a unilateral APA within 12 months from the application date.  In 2002, 
the median for completing negotiating positions was 12.0 months (average 13.7), and the median 
for completing unilateral APAs was 15.9 months (average 20.2). 
 
(2) 
Due Diligence 
 
The APA team must satisfy itself that the relevant facts submitted by the taxpayer are complete 
and accurate.  This due diligence aspect of the APA is vital to the process.  It is because of this 
due diligence that the IRS can reach advance agreements with taxpayers in the highly factual 
setting of transfer pricing.  Due diligence can proceed in a number of ways.  Typically, the 
taxpayer and the APA team will agree to dates for future meetings during the opening 
conference. In advance of the opening conference, the APA team leader will submit a list of 
questions to the taxpayer for discussion. The opening conference may result in a second set of 
questions.  These questions are developed by the APA team and provided to the taxpayer through 
the APA team leader.  It is important to note that this due diligence is not an audit and is focused 
on the transfer pricing issues associated with the transactions in the taxpayer’s application, or 
such other transactions that the taxpayer and the IRS may agree to add. 
 
(3)  
Analysis  
 
A significant part of the analytical work associated with an APA is done typically by the APA or 
IRS field economist assigned to the case.  The analysis may result in the need for additional 
information.  Once the IRS APA team has completed its due diligence and analysis, it begins 
negotiations with the taxpayer over the various aspects of the APA including the selection of 
comparable transactions, asset intensity and other adjustments, the TPM, which transactions to 
cover, the appropriate critical assumptions, the APA term, and other key issues.  The APA team 
leader will discuss particularly difficult issues with his or her managers, but generally the APA 
team leader is empowered to negotiate the APA. 
 
(4)  
Discussion and Agreement 
 
This phase differs for bilateral and unilateral cases.  In a bilateral case, the discussions proceed in 
two parts and involve two IRS offices -- the APA Program and the U.S. Competent Authority.  
In the first part, the APA team will attempt to reach a consensus with the taxpayer regarding the 
recommended position that the U.S. Competent Authority should take in negotiations with its 
treaty partner.  This recommended U.S. negotiating position is a paper drafted by the APA team 
leader and signed by the APA Director that provides the APA Program’s view of the best TPM 
for the covered transaction, taking into account IRC § 482 and the regulations thereunder, the 
relevant tax treaty, and the U.S. Competent Authority’s experience with the treaty partner. 
 
The experience of the APA office and the U.S. Competent Authority is that APA negotiations 
are likely to proceed more rapidly with a foreign competent authority if the taxpayer fully 
supports the U.S. negotiating position.  Consequently, the APA Office works together with the 
taxpayer in developing the recommended U.S. negotiating position.  On occasion, the APA team 
 
 
4 
will agree to disagree with a taxpayer.  In these cases, the APA office will send a recommended 
U.S. negotiating position to the U.S. Competent Authority that includes elements with which the 
taxpayer does not agree.  This disagreement is noted in the paper.  The APA team leader also 
solicits the views of the field members of the APA team, and, in the vast majority of APA cases, 
the international examiner, LMSB field counsel, and other IRS field team members concur in the 
position prepared by the APA team leader. 
 
Once the APA Program completes the recommended U.S. negotiating position, the APA process 
shifts from the APA Program to the U.S. Competent Authority.  The U.S. Competent Authority 
analyst assigned to the APA takes the recommended U.S. negotiating position and prepares the 
final U.S. negotiating position, which is then transmitted to the foreign competent authority.  The 
negotiations with the foreign competent authority are conducted by the U.S. Competent 
Authority analyst, most often in face-to-face negotiating sessions conducted periodically 
throughout the year.  At the request of the U.S. Competent Authority analyst, the APA team 
leader may continue to assist the negotiations. 
 
In unilateral APA cases, the discussions proceed solely between the APA Program and the 
taxpayer.  In a unilateral case, the taxpayer and the APA Program must reach agreement to 
conclude an APA.  Like the bilateral cases, the APA team leader almost always will achieve a 
consensus with the IRS field personnel assigned to the APA team regarding the final APA.  The 
APA Program has a procedure in which the IRS field personnel are solicited formally for their 
concurrence in the final APA.  This concurrence, or any items in disagreement, is noted in a 
cover memorandum prepared by the APA team leader that accompanies the final APA sent 
forward for review and execution. 
 
(5) 
Drafting, Review, and Execution 
 
Once the IRS and the taxpayer reach agreement, the drafting of the final APA generally takes 
little time because the APA Program has developed standard language that is incorporated into 
every APA.  The current version of this language is found in Attachment A.  APAs are reviewed 
by the Branch Chief and the APA Director.  In addition, the team leader prepares a summary 
memorandum for the Associate Chief Counsel (International) (ACC(I)).  On March 1, 2001, the 
ACC(I) delegated to the APA Director the authority to execute APAs on behalf of the IRS.  See 
Chief Counsel Notice CC-2001-016.  The APA is executed for the taxpayer by an appropriate 
corporate officer. 
 
Model APA at Attachment A 
[§ 521(b)(2)(B)] 
 
Attachment A contains the current version of the model APA language.  As part of its continuing 
effort to improve its work product, the APA Program has revised the model language to reflect 
the program’s collective experience with substantive and drafting issues.

The Current APA Office Structure, Composition, and Operation 
 
In 2002, the APA Office consisted of four branches with Branches 1 and 3 staffed with APA 
team leaders and Branch 2 staffed with economists and a paralegal.1  Branch 4, the APA West 
Coast branch, opened an additional office in Laguna Niguel and moved its headquarters there.  
Its staffing is indicated in the chart below.   
 
Overall, the APA staff decreased from 38 to 34 as a result of attrition and transfers to other Chief 
Counsel functions.  The number of APA team leaders decreased from 22 to 17, while the number 
of economists remained constant at 7.  Despite the decrease in the number of APA team leaders, 
the combination of the APA Program’s extensive training and smaller caseloads per APA team 
leader increased productivity and the currency of the APA inventory. 
 
As of December 31, 2002, the APA staff was as follows: 
  
Director’s Office 
1 Acting Director (also Chief, Branch 1) 
1 Special Counsel to the Director 
1 Secretary to the Director 
Branch 1 
1 Branch Chief

APA Training 
 
In 2002, the APA Office continued to emphasize training as a high priority, dedicating two half-
days each month to full staff training sessions.  These training sessions regarded APA-related 
current developments, new APA office practices and procedures, and international tax law 
issues.  Updated APA New Hire Training materials were published and provided to the APA 
staff, and to the public through the APA internet site on the IRS Digital Daily (www.irs.gov).   
 
                                                             
1 Branch 3 includes one team leader with the principal responsibility for annual report review and Branch 2 includes 
one economist who spends approximately 35% of his time reviewing annual reports.

2 Approximately half of the 58 bilateral APAs executed in 2002 regarded companies carrying on limited business 
activities.  These APAs were negotiated based on a bilateral competent authority agreement that established 
streamlined resolution guidelines. 
3 In 2002, the APA Office and taxpayers agreed to amend nine APAs (seven unilateral and two bilateral).  In six of 
these, the taxpayer reorganized its business.  In three, the changes reflected technical corrections or modifications to 
minor aspects of the APA. 
4 In the history of the APA Program, five APAs have been canceled and no APAs have been revoked.   
5 Reasons for withdrawals included jurisdictional issues, inventory corrections, taxpayer reorganizations, and 
changes in facts and circumstances.

6 The average time required to conclude a bilateral APA has historically been split roughly equally between the APA 
and U.S. Competent Authority Offices. 
7 Most of the APAs completed in six months or less related to companies carrying on limited business activities.  
These APAs were negotiated based on a bilateral competent authority agreement that established streamlined 
resolution guidelines.

Discussion 
 
The vast majority of APAs have covered transactions that involve numerous business functions 
and risks. For instance, with respect to functions, companies that manufacture products have 
typically conducted research and development, engaged in product design and engineering, 
manufactured the product, marketed and distributed the product, and performed support 
functions such as legal, finance, and human resources services. Regarding risks, companies have 
been subject to market risks, R&D risks, financial risks, credit and collection risks, product 
liability risks, and general business risks. In the APA evaluation process a significant amount of 
time and effort is devoted to understanding how the functions and risks are allocated amongst the 
controlled group of companies that are party to the covered transactions. 
 
In its APA submission, the taxpayer must provide a functional analysis. The functional analysis 
identifies the economic activities performed, the assets employed, the economic costs incurred, 
and the risks assumed by each of the controlled parties. The importance of the functional analysis 
derives from the fact that economic theory posits that there is a positive relationship between risk 
and expected return and that different functions provide different value and have different 
opportunity costs associated with them. It is important that the functional analysis go beyond 
simply categorizing the tested party as, say, a distributor. It should provide more specific 
information since, in the example of distributors, not all distributors undertake similar functions 
and risks. 
 
Thus, the functional analysis is critical in determining the TPM (including the selection of 
comparables). Although functional comparability is an essential factor in evaluating the 
reliability of the TPM (including the selection of comparables), the APA evaluation process also 
involves consideration of economic conditions such as the economic condition of the particular 
industry. 
 
In evaluating the functional analysis, the APA program considers contractual terms between the 
controlled parties and the consistency of the conduct of the parties with respect to the allocation 
of risk. In accord with the section 482 regulations, the APA program also gives consideration to 
the ability of controlled parties to fund losses that might be expected to occur as the result of the 
assumption of risk. Another relevant factor considered in evaluating the functional analysis is the 
extent to which each controlled party exercises managerial or operational control over the 
business activities that directly influence the amount of income or loss realized. The section 482 
regulations posit that parties at arm's length will ordinarily bear a greater share of those risks 
over which they have relatively more control.

Discussion 
 
The TPMs used in APAs completed during Year 2002 were based on the section 482 regulations.  
Under Treas. Reg. § 1.482-3, the arm’s length amount for controlled transfers of tangible 
property may be determined using the Comparable Uncontrolled Price (CUP) method, the Resale 
Price Method, the Cost Plus Method, the Comparable Profits Method (CPM), or the Profit Split 
method.  Under Treas. Reg. § 1.482-4, the arm’s length amount for controlled transfers of 
intangible property may be determined using the Comparable Uncontrolled Transaction (CUT) 
method, CPM, or the Profit Split Method.  An “Unspecified Method” may be used for both 
tangible and intangible property if it provides a more reliable result than the enumerated methods 
under the best method rule of Treas. Reg. § 1.482-1(c).  For transfers involving the provision of 
services, Treas. Reg. § 1.482-2(b) provides that services performed for the benefit of another 
member of a controlled group should bear an arm’s length charge, either deemed to be equal to 
the cost of providing the services (when non-integral) or which should be an amount that would 
have been charged between independent parties.   
 
In addition, Treas. Reg. § 1.482-2(a) provides rules concerning the proper treatment of loans or 
advances, and Treas. Reg. § 1.482-7 provides rules for qualified cost sharing arrangements under 
which the parties agree to share the costs of development of intangibles in proportion to their 
shares of reasonably anticipated benefits.  APAs involving cost sharing arrangements generally 
address both the method of allocating costs among the parties as well as determining the 
appropriate amount of the “buy-in” payment due for the transfer of intangibles to the controlled 
participants.   
 
In reviewing the TPMs applicable to transfers of tangible and intangible property reflected in 
Table 16, the majority of the APAs followed the specified methods.  However, there are several 
distinguishing points that should be made.  The Regulations note that for transfers of tangible 
property, the Comparable Uncontrolled Price (CUP) method will generally be the most direct 
and reliable measure of an arm’s length price for the controlled transaction if sufficiently reliable 
comparable transactions can be identified.  Treas. Reg. § 1.482-3(b)(2)(ii)(A).  It was the 
experience of the APA Program in Year 2002 that in the cases that come into the APA Program, 
sufficiently reliable CUP transactions are difficult to find.  In APAs executed in Year 2002, there 
were five covered transactions that used the CUP method; three looked to published market data 
and two used internal data on transactions between the taxpayer and unrelated parties.   
 
 15 
Similar to the CUP method, for transfers of intangible property, the CUT method will generally 
provide the most reliable measure of an arm’s length result if sufficiently reliable comparables 
may be found.  Treas. Reg. § 1.482-4(c)(2)(ii).  It has generally been difficult to identify external 
comparables, and APAs using the CUT method tend to rely on internal transactions between the 
taxpayer and unrelated parties.  In Year 2002, there were eight covered transactions that utilized 
the CUT TPM.   
 
The Cost Plus Method (tangibles only) and Resale Price Method were applied in Year 2002 in 
five and eight APAs respectively.  See Treas. Reg. § 1.482-3(c), (d).   
 
The CPM is frequently applied in APAs.  This is because reliable public data on comparable 
business activities of independent companies may be more readily available than potential CUP 
data, and comparability of resources employed, functions, risks, and other relevant 
considerations is more likely to exist than comparability of product.  The CPM also tends to be 
less sensitive than other methods to differences in accounting practices between the tested party 
and comparable companies, e.g., classification of expenses as cost of goods sold or operating 
expenses.  Treas. Reg. § 1.482-3(c)(3)(iii)(B), and -3(d)(3)(iii)(B).  In addition, the degree of 
functional comparability required to obtain a reliable result under the CPM is generally less than 
required under the Resale Price or Cost Plus methods, because differences in functions 
performed often are reflected in operating expenses, and thus taxpayers performing different 
functions may have very different gross profit margins but earn similar levels of operating profit.  
Treas. Reg. § 1.482-5(c)(2). 
 
Table 16 reflects 35 uses of the CPM (with varying PLIs) in covered transactions involving 
tangible or intangible property.  The CPM was also used in some APAs concurrently with other 
methods.   
 
The CPM has proven to be versatile in part because of the various PLIs that can be used in 
connection with the method.  Reaching agreement on the appropriate PLI has been the subject of 
much discussion in many of the cases, and it depends heavily on the facts and circumstances.  
Some APAs have called for different PLIs to apply to different parts of the covered transactions 
or with one PLI used as a check against the primary PLI.   
 
The CPM also was used regularly with services as the covered transactions in APAs executed in 
Year 2002.  There were a total of fifteen services covered transactions using the CPM method 
with various PLIs according to the specific facts of the taxpayers involved.  Table 17 reflects the 
methods used to determine the arm’s length results for APAs involving services transactions.   
 
In Year 2002, there were fourteen APAs involving tangible or intangible property that used the 
residual profit split, Treas. Reg. § 1.482-6(c)(3).  In residual profit split cases, routine 
contributions by the controlled parties are allocated routine market returns, and the residual 
income is allocated among the controlled taxpayers based upon the relative value of their 
contributions of intangible property to the relevant business activity.

Discussion 
 
APAs include critical assumptions upon which their respective TPMs depend.  A critical 
assumption is any fact (whether or not within the control of the taxpayer) related to the taxpayer, 
a third party, an industry, or business and economic conditions, the continued existence of which 
is material to the taxpayer's proposed TPM.  Critical assumptions might include, for example, a 
particular mode of conducting business operations, a particular corporate or business structure, or 
a range of expected business volume.  Rev. Proc. 96-53, § 5.07. Failure to meet a critical 
assumption may render an APA inappropriate or unworkable. 
 
A critical assumption may change (and/or fail to materialize) due to uncontrollable changes in 
economic circumstances, such as a fundamental and dramatic change in the economic conditions 
of a particular industry.  In addition, a critical assumption may change (and/or fail to materialize) 
due to a taxpayer's actions that are initiated for good faith business reasons, such as a change in 
business strategy, mode of conducting operations, or the cessation or transfer of a business 
segment or entity covered by the APA. 
 
If a critical assumption has not been met, the APA may be revised by agreement of the parties.  
If such agreement cannot be achieved, the APA may be canceled.  If a critical assumption has 
not been met, it requires taxpayer's notice to and discussion with the Service, and, in the case of a 
bilateral APA, competent authority consideration.  Rev. Proc. 96-53, § 11.07.

Discussion 
 
At the core of most APAs are comparables.  The APA program works closely with taxpayers to 
find the best and most reliable comparables for each covered transaction.  In some cases, CUPs 
or CUTs can be identified.  In other cases, comparable business activities of independent 
companies are utilized in applying the CPM or residual profit split methods.  Generally, in the 
APA Program's experience since 1991, CUPs and CUTs have been most often derived from the 
internal transactions of the taxpayer.   
 
For profit-based methods in which comparable business activities or functions of independent 
companies are sought, the APA Program typically has applied a three-part process.  First, a pool 
of potential comparables has been identified through broad searches.  From this pool, companies 
having transactions that are clearly not comparable to those of the tested party have been 
eliminated through the use of quantitative and qualitative analyses, i.e., quantitative screens and 
business descriptions.  Then, based on a review of available descriptive and financial data, a set 
                                                             
14 The majority of these LIFO to FIFO inventory accounting adjustments regard business activities addressed by a 
bilateral competent authority agreement that established streamlined resolution guidelines. 
 
 19 
of comparable transactions or business activities of independent companies has been finalized.  
The comparability of the finalized set has then been enhanced through the application of 
adjustments.     
 
Sources of Comparables 
 
Comparables used in APAs can be U.S. or foreign.  This depends on the relevant market, the 
type of transaction being evaluated, and the results of the functional and risk analyses.  In 
general, comparables have been located by searching a variety of databases that provide data on 
U.S. publicly traded companies and on a combination of public and private non-U.S. companies.  
Table 19 shows the various databases and other sources used in selecting comparables for the 
APAs executed in Year 2002.   
 
Although comparables were most often identified from the databases cited in Table 19, in some 
cases comparables were found from other sources, such as comparables derived internally from 
taxpayer transactions with third parties. 
 
Selecting Comparables 
 
Initial pools of potential comparables generally are derived from the databases using a 
combination of industry and keyword identifiers. Then, the pool is refined using a variety of 
selection criteria specific to the transaction or business activity being tested and the TPM being 
used. 
 
The listed databases allow for searches by industrial classification, by keywords, or by both.  
These searches can yield a number of companies whose business activities may or may not be 
comparable to those of the entity being tested.  Therefore, comparables based solely on industry 
classification or keyword searches are rarely used in APAs.  Instead, the pool of comparables is 
examined closely, and companies are selected based on a combination of screens, business 
descriptions, and other information found in the companies’ Annual Reports to shareholders and 
filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).   
 
Business activities are required to meet certain basic comparability criteria to be considered 
comparables.  Functions, risks, economic conditions, and the property (product or intangible) and 
services associated with the transaction must be comparable.  Determining comparability can be 
difficult – the goal has been to use comparability criteria restrictive enough to eliminate business 
activities that are not comparable, but yet not so restrictive as to have no comparables remaining.  
The APA Program normally has begun with relatively strict comparability criteria and then has 
relaxed them slightly if necessary to derive a pool of reliable comparables.  A determination on 
the appropriate size of the comparables set, as well as the business activities that comprise the 
set, is highly fact specific and depends on the reliability of the results. 
 
In addition, the APA Program, consistent with the section 482 regulations, generally has looked 
at the results of comparables over a multi-year period.  Sometimes this has been three years, but 
it has been more or less, depending on the circumstances of the controlled transaction.  Using a 
shorter period might result in the inclusion of comparables in different stages of economic 
 
 20 
development or use of atypical years of a comparable subject to cyclical fluctuations in business 
conditions.   
 
Many covered transactions have been tested with comparables that have been chosen using 
additional criteria and/or screens. These include sales level criteria and tests for financial distress 
and product comparability.  These common selection criteria and screens have been used to 
increase the overall comparability of a group of companies and as a basis for further research.  
The sales level screen, for example, has been used to remove companies that, due to their size, 
might face fundamentally different economic conditions from those of the transaction or business 
activities being tested.  In addition, APA analyses have incorporated selection criteria related to 
removing companies experiencing "financial distress" due to concerns that companies in 
financial distress often have experienced unusual circumstances that would render them not 
comparable to the business activity being tested.  These criteria include:  an unfavorable auditor's 
opinion, bankruptcy, and in certain circumstances, operating losses in a given number of years. 
 
An additional important class of selection criteria is the development and ownership of 
intangible property.  In some cases in which the business activity being tested is a manufacturer, 
several criteria have been used to ensure, for example, that if the controlled entity does not own 
significant manufacturing intangibles or conduct research and development (R&D), then neither 
will the comparables.  These selection criteria have included determining the importance of 
patents to a company or screening for R&D expenditures as a percentage of sales.  Again, 
quantitative screens related to identifying comparables with significant intangible property 
generally have been used in conjunction with an understanding of the comparable derived from 
publicly available business information. 
 
Selection criteria relating to asset comparability and operating expense comparability have also 
been used at times.  A screen of property, plant, and equipment (PP&E) as a percentage of sales 
or assets, combined with a reading of a company's SEC filings, has been used to help ensure that 
distributors (generally lower PP&E) were not compared with manufacturers (generally higher 
PP&E), regardless of their industry classification.  Similarly, a test involving the ratio of 
operating expenses to sales has helped to determine whether a company undertakes a significant 
marketing and distribution function.   
 
Table 22 shows the number of times various screens were used in APAs executed in Year 2002:

Adjusting Comparables 
 
After the comparables have been selected, the regulations require that "[i]f there are material 
differences between the controlled and uncontrolled transactions, adjustments must be made if 
the effect of such differences on prices or profits can be ascertained with sufficient accuracy to 
improve the reliability of the results."  Treas. Reg. § 1.482-1(d)(2).  In almost all cases involving 
income-statement-based PLIs, certain "asset intensity" or "balance sheet" adjustments for factors 
that have generally agreed-upon effects on profits are calculated.  In addition, in specific cases, 
additional adjustments are performed to improve reliability. 
 
The most common balance sheet adjustments used in APAs are adjustments for differences in 
accounts receivable, inventories, and accounts payable.  The APA Program generally has 
required adjustments for receivables, inventory, and payables based on the principle that there is 
an opportunity cost for holding assets.  For these assets it is generally assumed that the cost is a 
short-term debt interest rate.  
 
To compare the profits of two business activities with different relative levels of receivables, 
inventory, or payables, the APA Program estimates the carrying costs of each item and adjusts 
profits accordingly.  Although different formulas have been used in specific APA cases, 
Attachment B presents one set of formulas used in many APAs.  Underlying these formulas are 
the notions that (1) balance sheet items should be expressed as mid-year averages, (2) formulas 
should try to avoid using data items that are being tested by the TPM (for example, if sales are 
controlled, then the denominator of the balance sheet ratio should not be sales), (3) a short-term 
interest rate should be used, and (4) an interest factor should recognize the average holding 
period of the relevant asset. 
 
 
 22 
The APA Program also requires that data be compared on a consistent accounting basis.  For 
example, although financial statements may be prepared on a first-in first-out (FIFO) basis, 
cross-company comparisons are less meaningful if one or more of the comparables use LIFO 
inventory accounting methods.  This adjustment directly affects costs of goods sold and 
inventories, and therefore affects both profitability measures and inventory adjustments. 
 
Still important in some cases is the adjustment for differences in relative levels of PP&E between 
a tested business activity and the comparables.  Ideally, comparables and the business activity 
being tested will have fairly similar relative levels of PP&E, since major differences can be a 
sign of fundamentally different functions and risks.  Typically, the PP&E adjustment is made 
using a medium term interest rate. 
 
Additional adjustments used less frequently include those for differences in other balance sheet 
items, operating expenses, R&D, or currency risk.  Accounting adjustments, such as 
reclassifying items from cost of goods sold to operating expenses, for example, are also made 
when warranted to increase reliability.  Often, data is not available for both the controlled and 
uncontrolled transactions in sufficient detail to allow for these types of adjustments. 
 
The adjustments made to comparables or tested parties in APAs executed in Year 2002 are 
reflected in table 21 above. 
 
Nature of Ranges and Adjustment Mechanisms 
[§ 521(b)(2)(D)(viii)–(ix)] 
 
The types of ranges and adjustment mechanisms used in APAs executed in Year 2002 are

Discussion 
 
Treas. Reg. § 1.482-1(e)(1) states that sometimes a pricing method will yield "a single result that 
is the most reliable measure of an arm's length result."  Sometimes, however, a method may yield 
"a range of reliable results," called the "arm's length range."  A taxpayer whose results fall within 
the arm's length range will not be subject to adjustment. 
 
Under Treas. Reg. § 1.482-1(e)(2)(i), such a range is normally derived by considering a set of 
more than one comparable uncontrolled transaction of similar comparability and reliability.  If 
these comparables are of very high quality, as defined in the Regulations, then under Treas. Reg. 
§ 1.482-1(e)(2)(iii)(A), the arm's length range includes the results of all of the comparables (from 
the least to the greatest).  However, the APA Program has only rarely identified cases meeting 
the requirements for the full range.  If the comparables are of lesser quality, then under Treas. 
Reg. § 1.482-1(e)(2)(iii)(B), "the reliability of the analysis must be increased, when it is possible 
to do so, by adjusting the range through application of a valid statistical method to the results of 
all of the uncontrolled comparables."  One such method, the "interquartile range," is ordinarily 
acceptable, although a different statistical method "may be applied if it provides a more reliable 
measure." The "interquartile range" is defined as, roughly, the range from the 25th to the 75th 
percentile of the comparables' results. See Treas. Reg. § 1.482-1(e)(2)(iii)(C).  The interquartile 
range was used 39 times in Year 2002. 
 
Nineteen covered transactions reflected on Table 23 specified a single, specific result, or "point."  
Ten of these covered transactions involved a CPM in which the taxpayer agreed to a specific 
result.  Some APAs specify not a point or a range, instead using a "floor" that requires the tested 
party's result be greater than or equal to some particular value.  Four APAs executed in Year 
2002 used a floor.   
 
Some APAs look to a tested party’s results over a period of years (multi-year averaging) to 
determine whether a taxpayer has complied with the APA.  In 2002, rolling multi-year averaging 
was used for twelve covered transactions.  Eleven of those used three-year averages, and the 
other one used a five-year average.  Cumulative multi-year averages were used for two covered 
transactions.  Of those two transactions, one used a five-year average, and one used a seven-year 
average.  Additionally, nine covered transactions used term averages. 
 
Adjustments 
 
Under Treas. Reg. § 1.482-1(e)(3), if a taxpayer's results fall outside the arm's length range, the 
Service may adjust the result "to any point within the arm's length range."  Accordingly, an APA 
may permit or require a taxpayer and its related parties to make an adjustment after the year's end 
to put the year's results within the range, or at the point specified by the APA.  Similarly, to 
enforce the terms of an APA, the Service may make such an adjustment.  When the APA 
specifies a range, the adjustment is sometimes to the closest edge of the range, and sometimes to 
another point such as the median of the interquartile range.  Depending on the facts of each case, 
such automatic adjustments are not always permitted.  APAs may specify that in such a case 
there will be a negotiation between the competent authorities involved to determine whether and 
to what extent an adjustment should be made.  APAs may permit automatic adjustments unless 
 
 24 
the result is far outside the range specified in the APA.  Thus APAs provide flexibility and 
efficiency, permitting adjustments when normal business fluctuations and uncertainties push the 
result somewhat outside the range. 
 
In order to conform the taxpayer's books to these tax adjustments, the APA usually permits a 
"compensating adjustment" as long as certain requirements are met.  Such compensating 
adjustments may be paid between the related parties with no interest, and the amount transferred 
will not be considered for purposes of penalties for failure to pay estimated tax.  See § 11.02 
Rev. Proc. 96-53.

Nature of Documentation Required 
[§ 521(b)(2)(D)(xi)]

Approaches for Sharing of Currency or Other Risks 
[§ 521(b)(2)(D)(xii)] 
 
During Year 2002, there were 38 tested parties that faced financial risks, including interest rate 
and currency risks.  Eleven APAs provide specific approaches for dealing with currency risk, 
including adjustment mechanisms and critical assumptions.   
 
Efforts to Ensure Compliance with APAs 
[§ 521(b)(2)(F)] 
 
As described in Rev. Proc. 96-53, section 11, APA taxpayers are required to file annual reports 
to demonstrate compliance with the terms and conditions of the APA.  The filing and review of 
annual reports is a critical part of the APA process.  Through annual report review, the APA 
program monitors taxpayer compliance with the APA on a contemporaneous basis.  Annual 
report review provides current information on the success or problems associated with the 
various TPMs adopted in the APA process. 
 
All reports received by the APA Office are tracked by one designated APA team leader who also 
has the primary responsibility for annual report review.  One of the economists also spends a 
significant amount of time reviewing annual reports.  Other APA team leaders also assist in this 
review, especially when the team leader who negotiated the case is available, since that person 
will already be familiar with the relevant facts and terms of the agreement.  Once received by the 
APA Office, the annual report is sent out to the district personnel with exam jurisdiction over the 
taxpayer.   
 
The statistics for the review of APA annual reports are reflected in Table 28 below.  As of 
December 31, 2002, there were 101 pending annual reports.  In Year 2002, there were 330 
reports closed.

compromise negotiations within the meaning of Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of 
Evidence. 
 
5. 
Compliance. 
 
a. 
For each taxable year covered by this APA (APA Year), if Taxpayer 
complies with the terms and conditions of this APA, then the IRS will not make or 
propose any allocation or adjustment under I.R.C. section 482 to the Covered 
Transactions. 
 
b. 
If Taxpayer does not comply, then the IRS may: 
 
i. 
enforce the terms and conditions of this APA and make or propose 
allocations or adjustments under I.R.C. section 482 consistent with 
this APA; 
 
ii. 
cancel or revoke this APA under section 11.05 or 11.06 of Revenue 
Procedure 96-53;  or 
 
iii. 
revise this APA, if the Parties agree. 
 
c. 
Taxpayer must timely file an Annual Report for each APA Year in 
accordance with Appendix C and section 11.01 of Revenue Procedure 96-53.  The IRS 
may request additional information reasonably necessary to clarify or complete the 
Annual Report.  Taxpayer will provide all requested information within 30 days.  
Additional time may be allowed for good cause. 
 
d. 
The IRS will determine whether Taxpayer has complied with this APA 
based on Taxpayer=s U.S. Returns, Financial Statements, and other APA Records, for 
the APA Term and any other year necessary to verify compliance.  For Taxpayer to 
comply with this APA, an independent certified public accountant must {use the 
following or an alternative} render an opinion that the Taxpayer=s Financial Statements 
present fairly, in all material respects, Taxpayer=s financial position under U.S. GAAP. 
 
 
 
30 
e. 
In accordance with section 11.04 of Revenue Procedure 96-53, Taxpayer 
will (1) maintain its APA Records, and (2) make them available to IRS in connection with 
an examination under section 11.03.  Compliance with this subparagraph constitutes 
compliance with the record-maintenance provisions of I.R.C. sections 6038A and 6038C 
for the Covered Transactions for any taxable year during the APA Term. 
 
f. 
If Taxpayer=s actual transactions do not result in compliance with the TPM, 
Taxpayer: 
 
i. 
Must report its taxable income in an amount that is consistent with 
the TPM and all other requirements of this APA on its timely filed 
U.S. Return.  However, for any APA Year, if Taxpayer=s timely filed 
U.S. Return is filed no later than 60 days after the effective date of 
this APA, then Taxpayer may instead report its taxable income in 
an amount that is consistent with the TPM and all other 
requirements of this APA on an amended U.S. Return filed no later 
than 120 days after the effective date of this APA. 
 
ii. 
May make compensating adjustments under Revenue Procedure 
96-53, section 11.02, subject to any modifications or restrictions in 
Appendix A or elsewhere in this APA.

The TPM is the resale price method (RPM).  Taxpayer must realize, 
recognize, and report results on its U.S. Returns that clearly reflect a 
gross margin (defined as gross profit divided by sales revenue as those 
terms are defined in Treasury Regulations sections 1.482-5(d)(1) and (2)) 
of between ____% and ___ % (the Arm=s Length Range) for the Covered 
Transactions. 
 
$ 
Cost Plus Method  
 
The TPM is the cost plus method.  Taxpayer must realize, 
recognize, and report results on its U.S. Returns that clearly reflect a ratio 
of gross profit to production costs (within the meaning of Treasury 
Regulations sections 1.482-3(d)(1) and (2)) of between ___% and ___% 
(the Arm=s Length Range) for the Covered Transactions. 
 
$ 
CPM with Berry Ratio PLI 
The TPM is the comparable profits method (CPM).  Taxpayer must 
realize, recognize, and report results on its U.S. Returns that clearly reflect 
a gross profit to operating expenses ratio (as those terms are defined in 
Treasury Regulations sections 1.482-5(d)(2) and (3)) of between ____ and 
___ (the Arm=s Length Range) for the Covered Transactions.

CPM using an Operating Margin PLI 
 
The TPM is the comparable profits method (CPM).  The profit level 
indicator is an operating margin.  Taxpayer=s reported operating profit 
(within the meaning of Treasury Regulations sections 1.482-5(d)(5)) must 
clearly reflect an operating margin (defined as the ratio of operating profit 
to sales revenue as those terms are defined in Treasury Regulations 
section 1.482-5(d)(1) and (4)) of between ____% and ___ % (the Arm=s 
Length Range) for the Covered Transactions. 
 
$ 
CPM using a Three-year Rolling Average Operating 
Margin PLI 
 
The TPM is the comparable profits method (CPM).  The profit level 
indicator is an operating margin.  Taxpayer=s Three-Year Rolling Average 
operating margin is defined as follows for any APA Year:  the sum of 
Taxpayer=s reported operating profit (within the meaning of Treasury 
Regulations section 1.482-5(d)(5)) for that APA Year and the two 
preceding years, divided by the sum of Taxpayer=s sales revenue (within 
the meaning of Treasury Regulations section 1.482-5(d)(1)) for that APA 
Year and the two preceding years.  Taxpayer=s Three-Year Rolling 
Average operating margin must be between ____% and ____% (the Arm=s 
Length Range.)

{For use with a CPM} 
 
For each APA Year, if Taxpayer=s year-end [Three-Year Rolling Average] 
{specify PLI used} for the Covered Transactions is not in compliance with the TPM, 
Taxpayer will make an adjustment that brings its [Three-Year Rolling Average] {specify 
PLI used} to {if the TPM specifies a point value, use that; if the TPM specifies an Arm=s 
Length Range, use the nearest edge of the Arm=s Length Range or a point such as the

ATTACHMENT B 
 
FORMULAS FOR BALANCE SHEET ADJUSTMENTS 
 
Definitions of Variables: 
 
AP 
= 
average accounts payable 
AR = 
average trade accounts receivable, net of allowance for bad debt 
cogs = 
cost of goods sold 
INV = 
average inventory, stated on FIFO basis 
opex = 
operating expenses (general, sales, administrative, and depreciation expenses) 
PPE = 
property, plant, and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation 
sales = 
net sales 
tc 
= 
total cost (cogs + opex, as defined above) 
h 
= 
average accounts payable or trade accounts receivable holding period, 
 
 
stated as a fraction of a year 
i 
= 
interest rate 
t 
= 
entity being tested  
c 
= 
comparable 
 
Equations: 
 
If Cost of Goods Sold is controlled (generally, sales in denominator of PLI): 
 
Receivables Adjustment (“RA”): 
RA = {[(ARt / salest) x salesc] - ARc} x {i/[1+(i x hc)]} 
Payables Adjustment (“PA”):  
PA = {[(APt / salest) x salesc] - APc} x {i/[1+(i x hc)]} 
Inventory Adjustment (“IA”):  
IA = {[(INVt / salest) x salesc] - INVc } x i 
PP&E Adjustment (“PPEA”):  
PPEA = {[(PPEt / salest) x salesc] - PPEc} x i 
 
If Sales are controlled (generally, costs in the denominator of PLI):18 
 
Receivables Adjustment (“RA”): 
RA =  {[(ARt / tct) x tcc] - ARc} x {i/[1+(i x hc)]} 
Payables Adjustment (“PA”):  
PA = {[(APt / tct) x tcc] - APc} x {i/[1+(i x hc)]} 
Inventory Adjustment (“IA”):  
IA = {[(INVt / tct) x tcc] - INVc } x i 
PP&E Adjustment (“PPEA”):  
PPEA = {[(PPEt / tct) x tcc] - PPEc} x i 
 
 
 
Then Adjust Comparables as Follows: 
adjusted salesc = salesc + RA 
adjusted cogsc  = cogsc + PA - IA 
adjusted opexc  = opexc - PPEA 
 
 
                                                             
18 Depending on the specific facts, the equations below may use total costs (“tc”) or cost of goods sold (“cogs”).
