v. 
 
JOSE RAUL BRUNO-SANDOVAL, 
 
Defendant - Appellant 
 
 
Appeal from the United States District Court  
for the Western District of Texas 
USDC No. 2:13-CR-929-1 
 
 
Before SMITH, BARKSDALE, and PRADO, Circuit Judges. 
PER CURIAM:* 
 
In contesting his 52-month within-advisory Sentencing Guidelines-
sentence, imposed following his conviction for illegal reentry, in violation of 8 
U.S.C. §§ 1326(a) & 1326(b)(1)(2), Jose Raul Bruno-Sandoval challenges the 
substantive reasonableness of his sentence, asserting it is greater than 
necessary to accomplish the sentencing objectives of 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a).  In 
support, he contends the district court’s application of Guideline § 2L1.2 (the 
                                         
* Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not 
be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. 
R. 47.5.4.

illegal reentry Guideline) double-counts his prior conviction and fails to 
account for the nonviolent nature of his offense, which he describes as an 
“international trespass”.  Bruno also asserts the district court failed to account 
for his personal circumstances and the circumstances of this offense.  In that 
regard, he states he returned to the United States for family reasons. 
 
Although, at sentencing, Bruno objected to the substantive reason-
ableness of his sentence, subject to review for abuse of discretion, Gall v. 
United States, 552 U.S. 38, 51 (2007), he claims, for the first time on appeal, 
that his  sentence  is  substantively  unreasonable  as  a  result  of  Guideline  
§ 2L1.2.  Therefore, regarding § 2L1.2, review is only for plain error.  E.g., 
United States v. Rodriguez, 15 F.3d 408, 414 (5th Cir. 1994).  Under that 
standard, Bruno must show a forfeited plain (clear or obvious) error that 
affected his substantial rights.  Puckett v. United States, 556 U.S. 129, 135 
(2009).  If he does so, we have the discretion to correct the error, but should do 
so only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the 
proceedings.  Id.  Nevertheless, regardless of whether review is for plain error 
or abuse of discretion, Bruno has identified no reversible error.   
Bruno acknowledges his challenge to Guideline § 2L1.2 is foreclosed; he 
raises it only to preserve it for possible future review.  E.g., United States v. 
Mondragon-Santiago, 564 F.3d 357, 366-367 (5th Cir. 2009).  Our court has 
also rejected his “double-counting” claim.  E.g., United States v. Duarte, 569 
F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir. 2009).  Similarly, our court is unpersuaded by the 
contention that the Guidelines fail to account for the nonviolent nature of an 
illegal reentry offense.  E.g., United States v. Aguirre-Villa, 460 F.3d 681, 683 
(5th Cir. 2006). 
 
The district court considered Bruno’s request for a lesser sentence but 
found that a sentence in the middle of the Guidelines-sentencing range was

appropriate.  His contentions regarding mitigating factors and benign motive 
do not rebut the presumption of reasonableness.  E.g., United States v. Cooks, 
589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir. 2009); United States v. Gomez-Herrera, 523 F.3d 
554, 565-66 (5th Cir. 2008). 
 
AFFIRMED.
