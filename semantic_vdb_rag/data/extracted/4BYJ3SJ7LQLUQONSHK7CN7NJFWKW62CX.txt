not precisely contemplated by existing
law.
Accordingly, the Chair sustains the
point of order.
E. RELATION OF AMENDMENT OR BILL TO EXISTING LAW
several sections of existing law
may be sufficiently broad in scope
to admit as germane an amend-
ment which is germane to another
section of that law not amended
by the bill.(18) But where a bill
amends existing law in one nar-
row particular, an amendment
proposing to modify such existing
law in other particulars will gen-
erally be ruled out as not ger-
mane.(19) As an example, if a bill
seeks only to modify the penalty
provisions of a law proscribing
specified conduct, an amendment
will not be germane if it seeks to
broaden the scope or alter the ap-
plicability of such law.(20) It is
generally held, therefore, that, to
a bill amending existing law in
one particular, an amendment
proposing to modify an unrelated
section of the law (1) or relating to
terms of that law that are not re-
ferred to in the bill (2) is not ger-
§ 35. 
Amendments

Bills
Which Amend Existing Law
It has been held that the rule of
germaneness applies to the rela-
tionship 
between 
a 
proposed
amendment and the pending bill
to which offered and not to the re-
lation between such amendment
and an existing title of the United
States Code which the pending
bill seeks to amend,(15)
except
where the bill is a continuation or
re-enactment of existing law, in
which case amendments seeking
to modify the law being extended
in a germane manner may be ger-
mane to the bill,(16) or where the
bill so comprehensively or di-
versely amends an existing law as
to permit amendments which are
germane to other provisions of
that law.(17) Thus, the germane-
ness of an amendment that pro-
poses to change existing law may
depend on the extent to which the
bill itself seeks to change the law.

AMENDMENTS AND THE GERMANENESS RULE
Ch. 28 § 35
It has been held that where an
amendment to a bill proposes
modification of a section of exist-
ing law in some respects, an
amendment to the amendment
may properly propose modification
of the same section of the law in
other respects.(7) Thus, it is held
that, to a substitute amendment
modifying a section of existing
law, an amendment further modi-
fying that section may be ger-
mane.(8)
Similarly, to an amendment in
the nature of a substitute, amend-
ing several sections of an existing
law, an amendment proposing fur-
ther modification of one of the sec-
tions sought to be amended has
been held to be germane.(9)
Where a bill amends existing
law in two unrelated respects, an
amendment 
proposing 
a 
third
modification may be germane.(10)
To a bill amending two sections
of the Food Stamp Act of 1964, an
amendment proposing a change in
a third section of the act was held
germane.(11)
mane. It may be said, then, that,
to a bill amending one section of
an existing law, an amendment
proposing further modification of
the law, as by amending another
section of that law, is usually not
germane.(3)
Similarly, if a bill amends exist-
ing law in several respects, but re-
lates to a single subject or has a
single purpose, an amendment is
not germane that proposes to
modify the law further in a man-
ner not related to the purpose of
the bill.(4)
To a bill amending existing law
in a limited respect, an amend-
ment repealing the law is not ger-
mane. Accordingly, to a bill estab-
lishing a new office within a gov-
ernment department, an amend-
ment to abolish the department is
not germane.(5)
The rule may be broadly stated
that, to a bill proposing solely to
amend one subtitle of an act, an
amendment is not germane which
would have the effect of repealing
or amending other sections of the
act that are not within the pur-
view of the bill.(6)
ticular purpose, an amendment pro-
posing changes in another section of
that law in a manner not within the
terms of the bill is not germane. See
Sec. 41.14, infra.
3. See §§ 35.6, 35.77, 39.12, 39.13,
infra.
4. See §§ 35.80, 35.91, 41.1, 41.2, infra.

culture), comprising an amendment

general or diverse nature as to
fundamentally change the law in-
volved, and thereby open the law
generally to amendments.(17)
Where the proposition under
consideration was to amend the
Defense Production Act of 1950,
an amendment proposing to add
provisions to such act, ‘‘notwith-
standing any other provision of
this or any other law,’’ was ruled
out of order as an attempt to
amend other laws not under con-
sideration.(18)
Of course, an amendment must
be germane to that title or portion
of the bill to which offered.(19)
Thus, the test of germaneness to a
pending title of a bill is the rela-
tionship of the amendment to that
title or to the law being amended
by that title, and not to other por-
tions of the bill not then pending
for amendment.(20)
But in some instances, due to
the scope and nature of the sub-
ject matter of a title of the bill
sought to be amended, amend-
To a bill re-enacting an existing
law in modified form, an amend-
ment proposing further modifica-
tion of that law may be ger-
mane.(12) And where a bill nar-
rowly amends only one section of
existing law, but is broadened by
amendment to alter another sec-
tion of the law, a further amend-
ment to change still other sections
of the law may be germane.(13)
But it should be noted that a
bill amending several sections of
one title of the United States
Code does not necessarily bring
the entire title under consider-
ation so as to permit an amend-
ment to any portion thereof.(14)
Even where a bill amends an act
in several particulars, an amend-
ment proposing further modifica-
tion of the act in respects not re-
lated to the subject of the bill is
not germane.(15) Thus, it has been
held that, to a bill amending an
act in two particulars, an amend-
ment offered to amend the act in
a third particular but in a manner
not related to the bill is not ger-
mane.(16)
The question for the Chair in
such cases is whether the bill
amending existing law is of such a

which seek to modify laws not di-

In the 78th Congress, a bill (7)
was under consideration which
stated in part: (8)
Be it enacted, etc., That part II of
subtitle C of title III of the Agricul-
tural Adjustment Act of 1938, as
amended, is amended by inserting at
the end thereof the following new sec-
tion:
ing thereto the following: ‘Provided fur-
ther, That such jurisdiction shall in no
case be exercised as to any crop now
planted or planted hereafter between
the date of the enactment of this act
and the date of the conclusion of
peace.’ ’’
A point of order was raised
against the amendment, as fol-
lows:
MR. [HAMPTON P.] FULMER [of South
Carolina]: I do not believe [the amend-
ment] is in line with the real purpose
of the bill, and it goes much further
than we intended under the bill, so it
is not germane to the bill.
In support of the point of order,
Mr. Clifford R. Hope, of Kansas,
stated:
Sec. 377. Notwithstanding any
other provisions of this act, for any
farm . . . which has in 1942 an acre-
age allotment for any commodity, ex-
cept wheat, under the provisions of
this title, the allotment for any sub-
sequent year shall not be reduced on
account of the failure to plant, har-
vest, or market, in whole or part, the
commodity in any of the years begin-
ning February 1, 1943, and ending
December 31 of the year in which
the President by proclamation or the
Congress by concurrent resolution
declares 
that 
hostilities 
in 
the
present war have terminated, if such
failure was due solely to—
(1) The shifting from the produc-
tion of the commodity to the produc-
tion of one or more needed war
crops, in accordance with the request
of the Secretary; or [other specified
causes]. . . .
The following amendment was
offered: (9)
Amendment 
offered 
by 
Mr. 
[H.

ed’’, strike out the balance of the sec-
tion and insert in lieu thereof ‘‘by
amending section 376 thereof by add-
Mr. Chairman, I call attention of the
Chair to the fact that section 376,
which is sought to be amended, deals
with one subject, and one only—the ju-
risdiction of the courts in the enforce-
ment of the penalty provisions of the
act. The provision in the bill under
consideration, while an amendment to
part II of subtitle C, does not in any
way go to the enforcement of the act,
through the courts or otherwise, but
simply provides for a different method
of making allotments to individual
farms in the case of the basic commod-
ities except wheat, and for making al-
lotments to the counties and States in
the case of wheat. It is a new section
and does not touch anything at all
under this subtitle except the method
and procedure of making allotments. I
submit that the amendment which the
gentleman offers cannot be germane,
because it applies only to the subject of
7. H.R. 1605 (Committee on Agri-
culture).

way involved in the committee provi-

The Chairman (10) in ruling on
the point of order, stated:
els for several agricultural
commodities, an amendment
adding another agricultural
commodity to be covered by
the same provisions of law
for that year was held ger-
mane.
During consideration of H.R.
4296 (a bill concerning emergency
price supports for 1975 crops) in
the Committee of the Whole, the
Chair overruled a point of order in
the 
circumstances 
described
above. The language of the bill to
which the amendment was offered
read as follows: (11)
The Chair is ready to rule and inter-
prets the amendment of the gentleman
from Maryland to involve the question
of jurisdiction and enforcement of ju-
risdiction for the whole act. His
amendment provides that such juris-
diction shall in no case be exercised as
to any crop. The bill before the Com-
mittee restricts itself to certain crops.
The amendment of the gentleman from
Maryland would in effect suspend ju-
risdiction to enforcing the entire Agri-
cultural Adjustment Act, because it
would do away with the machinery for
such suspension, and, therefore, the
Chair is inclined to rule that the
amendment is too far reaching, and
goes beyond the scope of the bill and is
not germane, and the Chair sustains
the point of order.

MR. [THOMAS S.] FOLEY [of Wash-

of the committee finds it necessary to
insist on his point of order.
I know the gentleman who has of-
fered the amendment is a strong sup-
porter of fruit nuts and is in great seri-
ousness in an effort to improve the bill,
but the reference in the amendment is
to a standard which cannot be admin-
istered because the country was not or-
ganized, the Congress was not orga-
nized at the time he alleges in the
amendment the Dingleberry support
price was created. But principally be-
cause under rule XVI, clause 7, the
fundamental purpose of this amend-
ment does not relate to the funda-
mental purpose of the bill, which is to
effect changes in the target prices of
loan rates on wheat, feed grain, and
cotton.
The nuttiness of an amendment has
never been found in the precedents of
the House as an argument against ger-
maneness. . . .
MR. CONTE: . . . I feel that this
amendment is germane in the context
of this bill. The whole bill is nutty, and
I am merely institutionalizing what
the American people have known all
along, that farm subsidies do not grow
on trees.

Under the general proposition that it
is in order to add another subject to a
proposition containing subjects of the
same class, the Chair would point out
that the amendment of the gentleman
from Massachusetts adds another agri-
cultural commodity to the commodities
proposed to be supported under the bill
during the same period of time.
The Chair rules, therefore, that the
gentleman’s amendment is germane
and overrules the point of order.

guage creating a new cotton pro-

fered (15) which sought to add the
provisions as to the new cotton
program at the end of the section
of existing law, thereby leaving
the existing section of law per-
taining to the corn program in-
tact. Mr. John H. Kyl, of Iowa,
made the point of order that the
amendment was not germane; the
Chairman,(16) however, having al-
ready stated that, ‘‘The purpose of
this amendment is to correct the
technical references,’’ ruled with-
out further elaboration that the
amendment was germane.

lowing new sentence: ‘‘The national al-

amendment to modify an-
other section of that law

AMENDMENTS AND THE GERMANENESS RULE
Ch. 28 § 35
In the 86th Congress, during
consideration of a bill (3) to amend
the Agricultural Trade Develop-
ment and Assistance Act of 1954,
an amendment was offered pro-
viding in part: (4)
Amendment offered by Mrs. Sul-
livan: . . . insert the following new
section 14 . . . :
of line 7, strike out the period and in-
sert a semicolon and add the following:
Provided, That to obtain a loan on cot-
ton, producer must furnish a certificate
of grade and staple signed by a li-
censed classer whose license is issued
by the United States Department of
Agriculture.
Mr. Henry B. Steagall, of Ala-
bama, made the point of order
that the amendment was not ger-
mane to the bill. The Chairman,(2)
sustaining the point of order, stat-
ed:
The bill now under consideration
seeks to amend section 4, which deals
with the amount only. The amendment
offered by the gentleman from Mis-
souri seeks to add a proposition which
might be germane to the original act
but which seems to the Chair not to be
related to the section of the act here
sought to be amended by the pending
bill.
Surplus Agricultural Products
for Needy—Amendment Pro-
viding for Food Stamp Plan
Sec. 14. Title III of the Agricul-
tural Trade Development and Assist-
ance Act of 1954, as amended, is fur-
ther amended by adding at the end
thereof the following new section:
‘‘Sec. 306. (a) In order to promote
the general welfare, raise the levels
of health and of nourishment for per-
sons whose incomes prevent them
from enjoying adequate diets, and
dispose in a beneficial manner of
food commodities acquired by the

the Secretary of Agriculture is here-
by authorized to . . . put into oper-
ation . . . a program to distribute to
needy persons in the United States
through a food stamp system such
surplus food commodities. . . .’’
A point of order was raised
against the amendment, as fol-
lows: (5)
MR. [CHARLES B.] HOEVEN [of Iowa]:
Mr. Chairman, I make the point of
order that the amendment is not ger-
mane to the extension of Public Law
480, as incorporated in the bill H.R.
8609.
The amendment proposes to estab-
lish a new distribution system within
§ 35.7 To a bill to amend the
act 
authorizing 
the 
Com-
modity Credit Corporation to
make 
surplus 
agricultural
products available for needy

and overruled the point of order,
also citing the following statement
of the Chair in a prior similar rul-
ing:
The act which the bill proposes to
amend and extend contains a provision
relating to the subject matter and, as
pointed out, is sufficiently broad and
does cover the material offered in this
amendment. . . .
Formula for State Participa-
tion in Food Stamp Pro-
gram—Amendment Affecting
Qualifications of Recipients
the United States. H.R. 8609 contains
no such provision to which this pro-
posed amendment is germane.
In addition, the proposed amend-
ment would suspend the operation of
section 416 of the Agricultural Act of
1949, as amended, which is not before
us.
The bill, H.R. 8609, contains only
one reference to section 416, but this
provision deals only with the labeling
of surplus foods, not with the system of
distributing these commodities. . . .
In defense of the amendment,
the 
proponent, 
Mrs. 
Leonor
Kretzer 
Sullivan, 
of 
Missouri,
stated as follows:
§ 35.8 To a bill authorizing
funds for the food stamp pro-
gram for the next fiscal year
and changing the formula for
state 
participation 
in 
the
program, an amendment re-
lating to the qualifications
for recipients of aid under
the program was held to be
germane.
In the 90th Congress, during
consideration of a bill (7) amending
two sections of the Food Stamp
Act of 1964, the following amend-
ment was offered, affecting a third
section: (8)
. . . H.R. 8609 is a bill to amend the
Agricultural Trade Development and
Assistance Act of 1954. . . . The Agri-
cultural Trade Development and As-
sistance Act of 1954 . . . contains pro-
visions . . . authorizing domestic dona-
tions of surplus food to our own needy.
This is contained in titles II and III of
the law.
The bill before us amends title II
and III in several respects. The bill be-
fore us furthermore contains language
clearly applicable to the domestic dis-
tribution of surplus foods. . . .
I make one further point in con-
testing the point of order. Cannon’s
Precedents, volume VIII, section 2941,
states:
Amendment offered by Mr. [William
F.] Ryan [of New York]: Add the fol-
lowing new section at the end of the
bill:
An act continuing and reenacting
an existing law is subject to amend-
ment modifying the provisions of the
law carried in the act. . . .

alties 
for 
Noncompliance
With Provisions of Bill
Sec. 3. Section 5 of the Food
Stamp Act of 1964 is amended by
adding at the end thereof the fol-
lowing new subsection:
‘‘(c) The Secretary shall issue regu-
lations providing that—
‘‘(1) families with very low money

purchase requirements which exceed
their budgetary resources. . . .
‘‘(3) families with very low money
incomes may not be required to com-
mit themselves to purchase stamps

A point of order was raised

lows: (9)
§ 35.9 To a bill to amend the
Agricultural Act of 1949 to
authorize the Secretary of
Labor to recruit and make
certain provisions for agri-
cultural workers from Mex-
ico, 
an 
amendment 
pro-
viding, in one part, penalties
for employing any Mexican
alien 
not 
duly 
admitted
‘‘under the terms of this act
or any other law’’ was held to
be not germane.
In the 82d Congress, a bill (11)
was under consideration which
provided in part as follows: (12)
MR. [WILLIAM R.] POAGE [of Texas]:
Mr. Chairman, I make the point of order
against the amendment that it is not ger-
mane to the purposes or objectives of this
bill, that it does not amend any of the
sections covered by this bill or the sub-
ject matter touched on by this bill.
Be it enacted, etc., That the Agricul-
tural Act of 1949 is amended by adding
at the end thereof a new title to read
as follows:
This bill relates only to sections 15
and 16. The amendment offered by the
gentleman from New York relates to
section 5 of the Food Stamp Act.
TITLE V—AGRICULTURAL WORKERS
The Chairman,(10) in ruling on
the point of order, stated:
Sec. 501. For the purpose of assist-
ing in such production of agricultural
commodities and products as the
Secretary of Agriculture deems nec-
essary, by supplying agricultural
workers from the Republic of Mexico
(pursuant to arrangements between
the United States and the Republic
of Mexico), the Secretary of Labor is
authorized—
The bill, which has been amended,
amends two sections of existing law.
The proposed amendment to add an-
other section to the pending bill would
amend a third section of existing law.
The Chair rules, therefore, that the
amendment is germane.

Mr. Harold D. Cooley, of North
Carolina, in support of the point
of order, stated: (15)
(1) to recruit such workers . . .
(2) to establish . . . reception cen-
ters at or near the places of actual
entry of such workers into the conti-
nental United States. . . .
(3) to provide transportation for
such workers. . . .
The following amendment was
offered: (13)
Mr. Chairman, I would like to call
attention to the fact that if section 509
had been introduced as a separate bill,
it would not even have been referred to
the 
Committee 
on 
Agriculture. 
It
would have gone to the Immigration
Committee.
In defense of the amendment,
the proponent stated as follows:
Amendment offered by Mr. Polk in
the nature of a substitute for H.R.
3283: That the Agriculture Act of 1949
is amended by adding at the end there-
of a new title to read as follows:
TITLE V—AGRICULTURAL WORKERS
Sec. 509. Any person who shall
employ any Mexican alien . . . not
lawfully entitled to enter . . . the
United States under the terms of
this act or any other law relating to
the immigration or expulsion of
aliens when such person . . . has
reasonable grounds to believe . . .
that such alien is not lawfully within
the United States . . . shall be
guilty of a felony. . . .
A point of order was raised
against the amendment, as fol-
lows: (14)
MR. [JAMES G.] POLK [of Ohio]: Mr.
Chairman, I call attention to the fact
that this bill amends the Social Secu-
rity Act, and I am speaking now on the
bill before the House, H.R. 3283. It
also amends the Immigration Act of
1917, and I refer to lines 7, 8, 9, and
10, on page 5. It amends the Internal
Revenue Code, and I refer to lines 2, 3
and 4, at the top of page 5. In other
words, in several instances the bill
which is before the House amends
other Federal statutes.
The Chairman,(16) in ruling on
the point of order, stated:
As the Chair understands the rule of
germaneness, its purpose is to provide
for and protect the orderly procedure
in the Committee of the Whole and in
the House. It is to protect the legisla-
tive processes, to protect the member-
ship from hasty, ill-considered, and ex-
traneous subject matter being offered
to the proposition under consideration.
An amendment, to be germane to a bill
under consideration, must be akin to
and relative to the subject matter of
MR. [HARRIS] ELLSWORTH
[of Or-
egon]: . . . Section 509 of the proposed
substitute deals only with the matter
of finding information as to the illegal
entry of alien Mexicans into the United
States, and imposes a penalty for fail-
ure to supply information concerning
such illegal entry. That is the sole pur-
pose and the sole effect of this section
509. It does not refer to the employ-
ment of farm labor, and it does not go
to the purpose of the bill.

lowing 
amendment 
was 
of-
fered: (19)
Amendment offered by Mr. Celler to
the amendment offered by Mr. Polk:
Add a new section as follows:
the bill. The Chair does not feel that
the provision of a penalty or the provi-
sion for civil relief from a law seeking
to be enacted would be a matter
unakin or unrelated to the bill. How-
ever, there is specific matter in the
amendment, to wit, ‘‘or any other law
relating to the immigration [or] expul-
sion of aliens’’ which is to be found in
section 509 to which specific objection
was made. The Chair has examined
the bill before the Committee and is
unable to find reference to any other
law relating to the immigration or ex-
pulsion of aliens.
Therefore, because of the references
just cited, the Chair sustains the point
of order.(17)
Sec. —. Any person who shall em-
ploy as a farm laborer any Mexican
alien . . . not lawfully entitled to
enter . . . the United States under
the terms of this act, when such per-
son . . . has reasonable grounds to
believe . . . that such alien farm la-
borer is not lawfully within the
United States . . . shall be guilty of
a misdemeanor, and upon conviction
thereof shall be punished by a fine
not exceeding $1,000, or by imprison-
ment. . . .
Mr. Harold D. Cooley, of North
Carolina, made the point of order
that the amendment was not ger-
mane to the amendment under
consideration. 
Mr. 
Emanuel
Celler, of New York, in support of
his amendment, stated: (20)
§ 35.10 To a proposition relat-
ing to the recruitment of
farm laborers from Mexico,
an amendment imposing pen-
alties on any person employ-
ing Mexican labor not law-
fully entitled to enter ‘‘under
the terms of this act’’ was
held to be germane.
In the 82d Congress, during
consideration of a proposition re-
lating to the recruitment of farm
laborers from Mexico,(18) the fol-
. . . This is a bill concerning the op-
erations of alien labor, what they shall
do and what they shall not do, under
the terms and conditions that they
may or may not come over the border,
and my amendment certainly is con-
sistent with the purposes and aims of
the bill in general. A penalty for viola-
tion of the terms laid down is germane.
The Chairman,(1) in ruling on
the point of order, stated:

similar amendment held to be ger-

Amendment offered by Mr. [Eman-
uel] Celler [of New York]: Add a new
section:
The Committee has before it a bill to
which the gentleman from Ohio has of-
fered an amendment, to which, in turn,
the gentleman from New York has of-
fered an amendment providing specific
penalties for violation of the provisions
of the bill when written into law. The
rule of germaneness has been inter-
preted rather narrowly, but the Chair
does not feel that it can declare or hold
that the provision of a penalty for the
violation of the provisions of the bill is
new subject matter or unrelated sub-
ject matter.
Therefore, the point of order is over-
ruled.(2)
—Amendment Relating to De-
tention of Aliens and Affect-

such detention facilities as may be
necessary for the apprehension and
removal to Mexico of Mexican aliens
illegally in the United States. Appro-
priations made to the Immigration
and Naturalization Service shall be
available for expenditures to carry
out the purposes of this act.
A point of order was raised
against the amendment, as fol-
lows: (5)
MR. [HAROLD D.] COOLEY [of North
Carolina]: [The amendment] broadens
the scope of the legislation under con-
sideration. It is not germane, and it ac-
tually constitutes an appropriation.
The Chairman,(6) in ruling on
the point of order, stated:
§ 35.11 To a bill amending the
Agricultural Act of 1949 to
permit importation of Mexi-
can agricultural workers, an
amendment relating to the
detention of Mexican aliens
generally 
in 
the 
United

available to carry out the
purposes of the provision

of the amendment clearly indicates it
is an effort to amend the Fair Labor
Standards Act, which is not before the
House at this time at all.
Mr. Eugene J. McCarthy, of
Minnesota, in support of the
amendment, stated:
—Amendment Affecting Labor
Standards 
Under 
Different
Act
Mr. Chairman, I would suggest that
there is an amendment to the Fair
Labor Standards Act already in the
bill, and it would seem to me another
amendment to the same effect would
not constitute a serious obstacle.
The Chairman,(10) in ruling on
the point of order, stated:
The bill H.R. 3283 refers to a certain
class of Mexican nationals, as de-
scribed in the bill. The amendment of-
fered by the gentleman from Texas
does not relate to this group described
in the bill, but to an entirely different
group of individuals—American citi-
zens and residents of the United
States. The amendment therefore is
beyond the purview of the bill H.R.
3283, and the Chair sustains the point
of order.
§ 35.12 To a bill amending the
Agricultural Act of 1949 to
permit importation of Mexi-
can agricultural workers, an
amendment providing that
notwithstanding the provi-

Fair 
Labor
Standards 
Act, 
‘‘the 
Sec-
retary of Labor is empow-
ered to authorize . . . the

germane.
In the 82d Congress, during

North Carolina, raised the point
of order that the amendment was
not germane to the section of the
bill to which offered, and con-
tended that the language to which
the amendment was directed was
that referring to investigation of
rates 
on 
manufactured 
prod-
ucts.(14)
Mr. Marvin Jones, of
Texas, in responding to the point
of order made by Mr. Bulwinkle,
pointed out that paragraph (1), to
which the amendment was actu-
ally directed, related to ‘‘all kinds
of discrimination in freight rates.’’
The Chairman (15) overruled the
point of order.

AMENDMENTS AND THE GERMANENESS RULE

ment, the proponent stated as fol-
lows:
Free 
Importation 
of 
Com-
modity—Amendment To In-
crease Domestic Supply of
Commodity by Action of Na-
tional Production Authority
MR. EDWIN ARTHUR HALL [of New
York]: Mr. Chairman, we are here to
try to get baling twine for the farmers
of the country. . . . [T]his amendment
should be submitted to a vote since it
is an honest effort to accomplish the
objective which we are all here to try
to accomplish.
The Chairman,(18) in ruling on
the point of order, stated:
The gentleman from New York offers
an amendment that has for its purpose
apparently an increase in the domestic
supply of baling twine. The pending
legislation is an amendment to the
Tariff Act of 1930. It appears from an
examination of the gentleman’s amend-
ment that it goes far beyond the scope
of the bill, in that it applies to dif-
ferent legislation; therefore the Chair
sustains the point of order.
§ 35.14 To a bill proposing to
amend the Tariff Act of 1930
to provide for the free impor-
tation 
of 
twine 
used 
for
baling hay, straw and the
like, 
an 
amendment 
pro-
posing an increase in the do-
mestic supply of baling twine
through allocation by the Na-
tional Production Authority
was held to be not germane.
In the 82d Congress, during
consideration of a bill (16)
pro-
viding as described above, the fol-
lowing 
amendment 
was 
of-
fered: (17)
Amendment offered by Mr. Edwin
Arthur Hall: Page 1, line 7, insert a
new section as follows:
Notice to Congress of Curtail-
ment 
of 
Agricultural 
Ex-
ports—Payments to Farmers
Affected
The National Production Authority
shall take all steps possible to allo-
cate from domestic supplies enough
baling twine to meet the needs of
American farmers not only for the
1951 purpose but for all subsequent
emergencies.
Mr. Jere Cooper, of Tennessee,
made the point of order that the
amendment was not germane to
the bill. In defense of the amend-
§ 35.15 To a section requiring
notice to Congress of curtail-

On Apr. 20, 1977,(19) during con-
sideration of H.R. 5840 (20) in the
Committee of the Whole, the
Chair sustained a point of order
against the amendment described
above. The proceedings were as
follows:
Amendment 
offered 
by 
Mr.
Sebelius: Page 8 after line 21, insert
the following:
‘‘(4)(A) Notwithstanding any provi-
sion of law, whenever the President
of the United States or any other
member of the executive branch of
the Federal Government suspends or
causes a suspension of export sales
of corn, wheat, soybeans, grain sor-
ghum, or cotton, the Secretary of Ag-
riculture shall make payments de-
scribed in subsection (B) and (C) to
any farmowner or operator who has
in storage at the beginning of the
suspension any amount of the com-
modity for which export sales have
been suspended; except that no such
payments may be made with regard
to any such commodity unless, at the
close of the calendar month pre-
ceding the calendar month in which
the suspension is initiated, the price
received by producers of such com-
modity was less than the parity
price.
‘‘(B) The first payment described
in subsection (A) shall become pay-
able at the initiation of the suspen-
sion of export sales of the commodity
concerned. Such payment shall be
made at a rate of 10 per centum of
the parity price per bushel or bale of
the commodity concerned which was
produced by the farm owner or oper-
ator and which is held in storage by
him at the time of the initiation of
the suspension. . . .
Sec. 105. Section 4(f) of the Export
Administration 
Act 
of 
1969, 
as
amended by section 104 of this Act,
is further amended by adding at the
end thereof the following new para-
graph:
‘‘(3) If the authority conferred by
this section is exercised to prohibit
or curtail the exportation of any ag-
ricultural commodity in order to ef-
fectuate the policies set forth in
clause (B) of paragraph (2) of section
3 of this Act, the President shall im-
mediately report such prohibition or
curtailment to the Congress, setting
forth the reasons therefor in detail.
If the Congress, within 30 days after
the date of its receipt of such report,
adopts a concurrent resolution dis-
approving such prohibition or cur-
tailment, then such prohibition or
curtailment shall cease to be effec-
tive with the adoption of such resolu-
tion. . . .

MR. [CLEMENT J.] ZABLOCKI [of Wis-

amendment the gentleman from Kan-

parity amendment pending in the part

Secretary of Agriculture to any farm-
owner or operator who has in storage
at the beginning of the suspension any

The 
standard

limit export controls for foreign policy
purposes under the Export Administra-
tion Act.
Second, the amendment gives the
President new authority where export
controls are imposed for new purposes
under a new act.
And, third, this new authority deals
solely with domestic matters which are
within the jurisdiction of another coun-
try.
As I said, it is a parity amendment.
Lastly, this is a farm subsidy issue,
not an issue of foreign affairs.
This bill does not deal with agricul-
tural parity, it does not deal with sup-
port controls.
Therefore, Mr. Chairman, I submit
that the amendment is not in order.
. . .
THE
CHAIRMAN: (1)
The Chair is
ready to rule.
H.R. 5840 is a bill to amend the Ex-
port Administration Act of 1969 in
order to extend the authorities of that
act, improve the administration of ex-
port controls under that act, and to
strengthen the antiboycott provisions
of that act.
Section 105 of the bill as amended
amends the procedure by which the
Secretary of Commerce can notify the
Congress of the exercise of authority
curtailing exports of agricultural prod-
ucts. It thereafter gives the Congress a
certain period of time within which to
disapprove if it so chooses.
The amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from Kansas (Mr. Sebelius)
goes beyond the purview of the title

that it would require payments by the

An amendment was offered (4)
which stated in part:
Bill To Extend Price Control
Act—Amendment To Exempt
Livestock Products
§ 35.17 To a bill to extend the
Price Control Act, an amend-
ment providing that notwith-
standing any provisions of
the act no regulation, direc-
tive, or allocation should be
issued or maintained with
respect to livestock or any
edible 
product 
processed
from livestock was held ger-
mane.

such action is advisable . . . the Sec-
retary 
of 
Agriculture 
may 
by

(1) provide for standard hampers
and round stave baskets for fruits and
vegetables. . . .
Mr. Joseph P. O’Hara, of Min-
nesota, made the point of order
that the amendment was not ger-
mane, stating,(5) ‘‘[I]t involves an
attempt to change the Constitu-
tion of the United States in dele-
gating authority to the Secretary
of Agriculture. . . .’’ Mr. Peter F.
Mack, Jr., of Illinois, the pro-
ponent of the amendment, stated:
In the 79th Congress, during
consideration of the Emergency
Price Control Act,(7) the following
amendment was offered: (8)
Amendment offered by Mr. [James
W.] Wadsworth [Jr., of New York]: On
page 4, after line 25, add a new section
to read as follows:
. . . I believe this amendment mere-
ly delegates authority for administra-
tion to the Secretary of Agriculture.
The Secretary of Agriculture already
has, by reason of the act of 1928, au-
thority to establish allowances for var-
ious containers. I believe that this
amendment merely gives him addi-
tional authority to establish containers
in addition to the ones already pro-
vided for.
The Chairman (6) sustained the
point of order, citing the rule that:
Sec. 4. Section 2 of the Emergency
Price Control Act of 1942, as amend-
ed, is amended by inserting at the
end of such section a new subsection
as follows:
‘‘(p) Notwithstanding any provi-

shall 
be

livestock.’’

Amendment

Mr.

MR. [FRANK E.] HOOK [of Michigan]:
Mr. Chairman, I make a point of order
against the amendment on the ground
that it goes beyond the scope of the bill
and is not germane to either the sec-
tion or the bill.
The Chairman,(9) in ruling on
the point of order, stated:
. . . The Chair invites attention to
the fact that the amendment is con-
fined to the Emergency Price Control
Act of 1942 which is sought here to be
amended, and the Chair is of the opin-
ion that the amendment is germane.

adding the following: ‘‘Provided fur-
ther, That no funds . . . shall be
used after June 30, 1946, to continue
any existing program or to institute
any new program for the payment of
subsidies on livestock or meat de-
rived from livestock . . . And pro-
vided further, That in order to pre-
vent the reduction of livestock prices

first, that it is not germane to the bill,

The bill only provides for the extension

this

term 
‘‘agriculture’’

1938 and to establish a new min-

Amendment offered by Mr. [William

Sec. 2. (a) Paragraph (f) of section
3 of the Fair Labor Standards Act of

amended),’’ the following: ‘‘the proc-
essing of shade-grown tobacco for
use as cigar wrapper tobacco by agri-
cultural employees employed in the
growing and harvesting of such to-
bacco, which processing shall in-
clude, but shall not be limited to,
drying, curing . . . and bailing, prior
to the stemming process,’’.
(b) Paragraph (m) of section 3 of
such Act, defining the term ‘‘wage’’,
is amended by inserting before the
period at the end thereof a colon and
the following: ‘‘Provided, That the
cost of board, lodging or other facili-
ties shall not be included as a part of
the wage paid to any employee to the
extent it is excluded therefrom under
the terms of a bona fide individual
contract 
or

bargaining

(c) Section 3 of such Act is further
amended by adding at the end there-
of the following new paragraphs:
. . .
‘‘(q) ‘Enterprise’ means the related
activities performed (either through
unified operation or common control)
by any person or persons for a com-
mon retail business purpose . . .
‘‘(r) ‘Enterprise engaged in com-

Mr. Roman C. Pucinski, of Illi-
nois, made a point of order
against the Herlong amendment
on the ground that it was not ger-
mane. In support of the point of
order, Mr. James G. O’Hara, of
Michigan, stated:
The amendment offered by the gen-
tleman 
from 
Florida 
attempts 
to
amend not the act before us, but Public
Law 78, under which migrant labor is
brought into the country, and the other
act of Congress under which the U.S.
Employment Service is established.
An exemption already exists under
the Fair Labor Standards Act, exempt-
ing agricultural labor from the applica-
tion of the Fair Labor Standards Act,
and this is an attempt to amend not
the Fair Labor Standards Act, but
other acts passed by various Con-
gresses.
The Chairman,(16) in ruling on
the point of order, stated:
‘‘(e) Whenever the Secretary has
reason to believe that in any indus-
try under this Act the competition of
foreign producers in United States
markets or in markets abroad, or
both, has resulted, or is likely to re-
sult, in increased unemployment in
the United States, he shall under-
take an investigation to gain full in-
formation with respect to the matter
and shall make a full and complete
report of his findings and determina-
tions to the President and to the
Congress.’’. . .
Sec. 11. The Secretary of Labor
shall study the complicated system
of exemptions now available for the
handling and processing of agricul-
tural products under such Act and
particularly sections 7(b)(3), 7(c), and
13(a)(10), and shall submit to the
second session of the Eighty-seventh
Congress at the time of his report
under section 4(d) of such Act a spe-
cial report containing the results of
such study and information, data,
and recommendations for further
legislation designed to simplify and
remove the inequities in the applica-
tion of such exemptions.
Subsequently, 
the 
following
amendment was offered: (15)
Amendment offered by Mr. [Albert

MR. ERLENBORN: . . . My amend-

amended in the bill before us.
This amendment would add section

procedural, and it is consonant with

with the period of initial organizational
activity as it relates to remedies. Cer-
tain remedies in the bill go to post-or-
ganizational conduct. The amendment
adds a new remedy.
In the opinion of the Chair, the
amendment is germane to the bill as a
whole and the point of order is over-
ruled.

A point of order was raised
against the amendment, as fol-
lows:
sidered to endanger the na-
tional defense was held not
germane.
In the 82d Congress, during
consideration of the Defense Pro-

Act 
Amendments 
of
1952,(3) the following amendment
was offered: (4)
Amendment offered by Mr. [Richard
W.] Bolling [of Missouri]: On page 3,
line 15, insert the following section:
MR. [FRANK] THOMPSON [Jr., of New
Jersey]: Mr. Chairman, I make a point
of order against the amendment on the
ground it is not germane. It would es-
tablish the joint administration of
funds for political purposes, a subject
not mentioned in the subject matter of
the legislation before us.
The Chairman,(2) in ruling on
the point of order, stated:
The bill under consideration amends
only section 302(c) of the act, whereas
the proposed amendment attempts to
amend the entire act and brings in
new matter that is not covered in sec-
tion 302(c) or in the bill.
The Chair rules that the amendment
is not germane, and sustains the point
of order.

A point of order was raised
against the amendment, as fol-
lows:
MR. [JAMES G.] FULTON [of Pennsyl-

point of order that the amendment is
out of order on the ground that it is
not germane to this section or to this
bill; that it is affirmative legislation

tion covered by the language of this
act.
The Chairman,(5) in ruling on
the point of order, stated: (6)
The Chair has had an opportunity to
study the amendment offered by the
gentleman from Missouri [Mr. Bolling]
and it is the opinion of the Chair that
the amendment proposes to make basic
changes in our labor legislation. The
amendment proposes further to amend
title II of the Defense Production Act of
1950, which is the authority to requisi-
tion property. The amendment goes be-
yond . . . the mere requisition of prop-
erty 
and 
. . . 
proposes 
to 
make
changes in our labor laws.
In view of the fact that it goes be-
yond the scope of title II of the Defense
Production Act of 1950, the Chair is
constrained to sustain the point of
order. . . .
Bill To Permit Common Situs
Picketing—Amendment Relat-
ing to Another Section of Law
Providing Remedies for Un-
fair Practices
Act, 
dealing 
with 
unfair
labor practices, to permit
common 
situs 
picketing
under certain circumstances,
an amendment further quali-
fying the right to so picket
and providing a civil remedy
for persons injured by illegal
pickets was ruled out as not
germane, being beyond the
scope of the bill, since the
law itself provided remedies
for unfair labor practices in
another section and the bill
was not sufficiently broad to
admit as germane amend-
ments relating to that sec-
tion.
During consideration of H.R.
5900 in the Committee of the
Whole on July 25, 1975,(7) the
Chair sustained a point of order
in the circumstances described
above. The section of the bill
pending and the amendment of-
fered thereto were as follows:
The Clerk read as follows:

amend existing law in one

gin. . . .
MR. [W. HENSEN] MOORE [of Lou-
isiana]: Mr. Chairman, I offer an
amendment.
The Clerk read as follows:
Amendment offered by Mr. Moore:
Page 5, line 3, immediately after
MR. [JAMES G.] O’HARA [of Michi-
gan]: . . . I make the point of order
that the amendment offered by the
gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Moore)
is not germane to the purposes of the
bill before us.
The bill before us is a very narrowly
drawn piece of legislation that affects
only 8(b)(4)(B) of the act. It affects only
the question of construction workers
picketing a construction site, and it
goes very narrowly to that point.
On the other hand, the amendment
offered by the gentleman from Lou-
isiana (Mr. Moore) goes ahead and sets
up a cause of action against labor orga-
nizations in Federal district courts, re-
covering lost wages and so forth.
It might be a germane provision to
the National Labor Relations Act, but
it is not a germane amendment to this
particular section of the act or to the
bill that is now before us. . . .
MR. MOORE: Mr. Chairman, I oppose
the point of order on the ground that
8846

Committee, and the specific amend-
ment to section 8(b)(4) of the act con-
tained in this bill is not such an inclu-
sive amendment to existing law as to
open the entire act to amendment
under the precedents of the House.
The Chair therefore finds that the
provision for civil remedies for unfair
labor practices is not germane to the
portion of the act defining those prac-
tices, and sustains the point of order.
Requirement of Certification of
Elections 
Involving 
Labor
Unions—Amendment 
Con-
taining

this bill takes away this power under
the appropriate section of this act. All
this does is exempt this proviso of this
particular action as it applies to these
particular employees, and this exemp-
tion to such a provision in this bill is
germane. The fact that it gives the
right of civil action means nothing
more than to strengthen the abilities of
this particular proviso. Therefore, Mr.
Chairman, I submit that it is indeed
very much germane.
THE
CHAIRMAN: (8)
The Chair is
ready to rule.
The gentleman from Michigan (Mr.
O’Hara) makes the point of order that
the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from Louisiana (Mr. Moore) is
not germane.
The gentleman from Louisiana (Mr.
Moore) has been kind enough to sub-
mit a copy of his amendment in ad-
vance, and the Chair has had the op-
portunity to study the amendment and
to read the report of the committee,
and the bill.
The Chair would state that the fun-
damental purpose of the bill is to per-
mit under certain conditions situs
strikes which are, as the result of a
Supreme Court decision, considered to
be unfair labor practices under section
8(b) of the National Labor Relations
Act.
The Chair notes that the amendment
provides a civil remedy for violation of
the provisions of the amendment. The
act itself, in another section, provides
remedies for unfair labor practices.
The remedy proposed here might be
germane to that section of the act con-
taining such remedies, however that
section of the act is not before the

During consideration of H.R.
8410 (9) in the Committee of the
Whole on Oct. 6, 1977,(10)
the
Chair overruled a point of order
against the amendment described
above. The proceedings were as
follows:
THE CHAIRMAN: (11) If there are no
additional amendments to section 8,
the Clerk will read.
The Clerk read as follows:
Sec. 9. (a) The third sentence of
subsection 10(e) is amended by in-
serting immediately before the pe-
riod at the end therof a comma and
the following: ‘‘nor shall any objec-
tion be considered by the court un-
less a petition for review pursuant to
subsection (f) of this section has been
timely filed by the party stating the
objection’’. . . .
MR. [JOHN M.] ASHBROOK [of Ohio]:
Mr. Chairman, I offer an amendment.

the

MR. ASHBROOK: Mr. Chairman, I
raise the point of order on the basis of
the Chair’s previous construction of
H.R. 8410 and amendments offered
thereto.
I point out to the Chair the amend-
ment offered by the gentleman from
Michigan (Mr. Ford) is not within the
scope of the bill. It refers in three
places to section 9(a) of the National
Labor Relations Act. Section 9(a) is not
opened up, as the Chair can determine,
by H.R. 8410. It is nongermane to my
amendment. It goes beyond the scope
of my amendment. The gentleman
from Michigan himself has indicated
that what he is trying to do is codify a
principle in case law. That in effect is
a substantive effort. . . .
MR. FORD of Michigan: . . . Mr.
Chairman, I agree with the gentleman
that I am attempting to codify the case
law, but I thought that I was agreeing
with his attempt to codify the case law
because we are both citing the same
case as authority for the language we
would now have as a part of the stat-
ute.
As to that part of the change in the
amendment that is common to both his
amendment and mine, the basis of the
case law we have cited is exactly the
same. Mine certainly could not be
found not to be germane, inasmuch as
we rely on exactly the same basis for
the language. Moreover, there is noth-
ing in my substitute that makes sub-
stantive changes in the law with re-
spect to the rights of employers and
employees. It has to do only with pro-
cedural practices in keeping with the
entire thrust of this bill to improve and
streamline and codify for that purpose
past practices and procedures.
With respect to section 9 of the act,
while it might be said that these proce-
dures refer to section 9 of the act, for
that matter they refer to all of the act.
But they are limited, and this amend-
ment is limited to affecting the method
by which these improvements achieve
the end of the act and not intended in
any way to effect a substantial change
in the sections of the act that are sub-
ject to this procedure. . . .
MR. ASHBROOK: Mr. Chairman, I
would merely want to reiterate that
the gentleman’s amendment clearly re-
fers to section 9(a). Section 9(a) has
not been opened up by this act. It is
not a proper substitute. The Chair on
several occasions has taken a very
strict interpretation of H.R. 8410 as it
relates to the National Labor Relations
Act, and I do not believe it can be
opened up at this point inconsistent
with those rulings.
THE
CHAIRMAN: The Chair would
like to inquire of the gentleman from
Michigan (Mr. Ford) as to how his sub-
stitute would affect section 9(a) of the
act.
MR. FORD of Michigan: 9(a) of the
bill?
THE CHAIRMAN: In a manner not af-
fected by the amendment offered by
8849
DESCHLER-BROWN PRECEDENTS
Ch. 28 § 35
the 
gentleman 
from 
Ohio 
(Mr.
Ashbrook). . . .
MR. FORD of Michigan: Mr. Chair-
man, I do not believe that I do. I be-
lieve that the gentleman limits the
method by which a collective bar-
gaining arrangement can come into
being, and we simply return to the ex-
isting law.
If the gentleman would make a
change in existing law, we stay with
the existing law.
THE CHAIRMAN: The Chair is ready
to rule.
The question, of course, pertains to
the germaneness of the amendment of-
fered by the gentleman from Michigan
(Mr. Ford) as a substitute for the
amendment offered by the gentleman
from Ohio (Mr. Ashbrook). That is the
test.
The substitute amendment offered
by the gentleman from Michigan (Mr.
Ford), down to section 9, in the middle
of the first page, contains the same
language of the amendment offered by
the 
gentleman 
from 
Ohio 
(Mr.
Ashbrook). From that point in the sub-
stitute, the Chair is of the opinion that
the substitute sets forth exceptions to
the Ashbrook amendment and incor-
porates definitions contained in section
9(a) of the act without amending other
sections of the law, and it seems to be
related to and is germane to the
amendment offered by the gentleman
from Ohio (Mr. Ashbrook).
Therefore, the Chair overrules the
point of order.
amend existing law in one
particular, an amendment to
further amend the law in an-
other respect unrelated to
the pending portion of the
bill and to the portion of ex-
isting law which it amends is
not germane; thus, to a sec-
tion of a bill amending that
section of the National Labor
Relations Act relating to pro-
cedural 
rules 
governing
labor elections and organiza-
tion, an amendment chang-
ing the same section of exist-
ing law to require the pro-
mulgation of rules defining
certain conduct as grounds
for voiding a labor election
was held not germane, where
neither the pending section
nor the bill itself addressed
the subject of unfair labor
practices as dealt with in an-
other section of existing law.
During consideration of H.R.
8410 (12) in the Committee of the
Whole on Oct. 5, 1977,(13)
the
Chair sustained a point of order
against the amendment described
above. The proceedings were as
follows:
MR. [JOHN M.] ASHBROOK [of Ohio]:
Mr. Chairman, I offer an amendment.
The Clerk read as follows:

pacity. Rather, it restricts absolutely
the nature and substance of the rule
the Board is directed to make.
The amendment deals not only with
organization campaign and representa-
tion cases, which is the subject matter
of this bill, but with strikes, lockouts,
and other labor disputes which are not
within the parameters of H.R. 8410, or
section 3 of the committee bill.
Mr. Chairman, the amendment is
therefore nongermane. . . .
MR. ASHBROOK: Mr. Chairman, on
page 17 of the bill, starting with line 1
of this act, it says:
Amendment 
offered 
by 
Mr.
Ashbrook: Page 17, line 5, insert ‘‘(i)’’
after ‘‘(A)’’ and insert the following
new subparagraph (ii) after line 15:
‘‘(ii) which shall assure that the
expressing of any views, arguments,
opinion, or the making of any state-
ment (including expressions intended
to influence the outcome of an orga-
nizing campaign, a bargaining con-
troversy, a strike, lockout, or other
labor dispute), or the dissemination
thereof, whether in written, printed,
graphic, visual, or auditory form,
shall not constitute grounds for, or
evidence justifying, setting aside the
results of any election conducted
under any of the provisions of this
Act, if such expression contains no
threat of reprisal or force or promise
of benefit.’’. . .
The Board shall within 12 months
after the date of enactment of the
Labor Reform Act of 1977 issue regu-
lations to implement the provisions
of section 9(c)(6) including rules—
And it goes on, as a matter of fact,
on lines 3 through 15 in the subject
matter we just dispensed with a few
moments ago. We specifically dealt
with the subject matter of both em-
ployers and employees attempting free
speech, speaking to those employees, I
think, going back again to page 16 and
talking about making the regulations,
referring to rules and regulations as
may be necessary to carry out the pro-
visions of this act.
Mr. Chairman, in the very preamble
of this act it says:
To amend the National Labor Re-
lations Act to strengthen the rem-
edies and expedite the procedures
under such Act.
Mr. Chairman, I feel that this
amendment, calling upon the Board to
issue rules, in addition to the rules
that are in H.R. 8410, is within the pa-
rameters of the debate and therefore
the point of order should be overruled.
MR. [WILLIAM D.] FORD [of Michi-
gan]: Mr. Chairman, I insist upon my
point of order. . . .
Mr. Chairman, the amendment of-
fered is to section 3 of the bill, which
in its present form amends section 6 of
the National Labor Relations Act,
which is the rulemaking authority of
that act. Under section 3, the Board is
directed to make rules that: First, af-
fect union actions during representa-
tion campaigns; second, define classes
of representation cases; and third,
schedules governing the holding of
elections.
The amendment proposed effectively
changes section 8(c) of the National
Labor Relations Act, not before us in
this bill, which deals with unfair labor
practices. As such, it is not directed at
the limited subject and scope of this
bill in dealing with rulemaking amend-
ments, as H.R. 8410 directs.
It is not in keeping with the act, and
the bill, which provides broad discre-
tion to the Board in its rulemaking ca-
8851
DESCHLER-BROWN PRECEDENTS
Ch. 28 § 35
Therefore, the point of order is sus-
tained.
§ 35.26 To a section of a bill
narrowly amending one sec-
tion of existing law dealing
with procedural rules gov-
erning labor elections and
organization, an amendment
to require promulgation of
rules defining unfair labor
practices, a subject covered
in another section of the law
but not addressed in the
pending section of the bill,
was held to be not germane.
During consideration of H.R.
8410 (15) in the Committee of the
Whole on Oct. 5, 1977,(16)
the
Chair, in sustaining a point of
order against the amendment de-
scribed above, reiterated the prop-
osition that an amendment must
be germane to the section of the
bill to which it is offered. The pro-
ceedings were as follows:
MR. [JOHN M.] ASHBROOK [of Ohio]:
Mr. Chairman, I offer an amend-
ment. . . .
The Clerk read as follows:
Amendment 
offered 
by 
Mr.
Ashbrook: Page 19, after line 5, in-
sert the following new paragraph (c):
‘‘(c) The Board shall within three
months after the date of enactment
of the Labor Reform Act of 1977,
issue rules or regulations to imple-
THE
CHAIRMAN: (14)
The Chair is
ready to rule.
The Chair has carefully followed the
remarks of both gentlemen. The Chair
is of the opinion that the point of order
made by the gentleman from Michigan
(Mr. Ford) should be sustained.
The Chair would like to state that
under section 3 of the committee bill
that is now before the Committee it
amends section 6 of the National Labor
Relations Act and restates the existing
authority of the NLRB to promulgate
rules and regulations to carry out the
provisions of the act, specifically in-
cluding certain authority to make pro-
cedural rules governing elections and
governing the period of initial stages of
organizational activity. The section of
the bill does not go to newly mandated
directions to the Board to promulgate
regulations to implement section 8 of
the act.
The amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from Ohio (Mr. Ashbrook),
while not directly amending section 8
of the act, would amend section 6 of
the act to direct the Board to promul-
gate regulations, and the amendment
would by its terms elevate those regu-
lations to a position of substantive law,
which regulations would conclusively
pronounce what conduct shall or shall
not constitute grounds for setting aside
an election.
In such form, the amendment goes
beyond the issue of implementing rule-
making authority and deals directly
with the question of whether conduct,
for the first time, would constitute an
unfair labor practice beyond the period
of initial stages of organizational activ-
ity, a matter not addressed by the com-
mittee bill in section 3.

including rules which shall assure
that no labor organization shall
threaten or impose an unreasonable

sanction against any person in the

to refrain from any or all concerted
activity or to invoke the processes of
the Board).’’
man to say that this bill does not
amend unfair labor practices. Section 7
clearly refers to unfair labor practices,
as does my amendment to section 3,
and I would hope the Chair would
overrule the point of order.
THE
CHAIRMAN: (17)
The Chair is
ready to rule.
The 
gentleman 
from 
Ohio 
(Mr.
Ashbrook) has offered an amendment
that, while not directly amending sec-
tion 8 of the act, would amend section
6 of the act to direct the Board to pro-
mulgate regulations. The amendment
would really reach issues of sub-
stantive law, since the regulations
would conclusively pronounce that cer-
tain union conduct shall constitute an
unfair labor practice under section 8.
In such form, the amendment goes be-
yond the issue of implementing rule-
making authority and deals directly
with the question of conduct which for
the first time would constitute an un-
fair labor practice beyond the period of
initial stages of organizational activity,
a matter not addressed by the com-
mittee bill in section 3.
The reference of the gentleman from
Ohio to the provisions of section 7 does
not alter the fact that an amendment
must be germane to the pending sec-
tion.
For that reason, the Chair must sus-
tain the point of order.
Provisions 
Affecting 
Ceiling
Prices Applicable to Certain
Personal 
Services—Amend-
ment Affecting Prices Appli-
cable to Manufacturers
§ 35.27 To a committee amend-
ment making price and wage
MR. [FRANK] THOMPSON [Jr., of New
Jersey]: Mr. Chairman, I make a point
of order against the amendment. . . .
Mr. Chairman, the amendment of-
fered by my colleague and friend from
Ohio (Mr. Ashbrook), although in some
ways meritorious, is offered to section
3 of the bill which amends section 6 of
the National Labor Relations Act, the
rulemaking authority. Under section 3,
the Board is directed to make rules,
first, that assure equal access during
representation campaigns, which we
have done; second, that define classes
of representation cases; and three,
schedules governing the holding of
elections.
The amendment offered, in effect,
changes section 8 of the act relating to
unfair labor practices. It is directed,
therefore, 
at 
a 
subject 
not 
con-
templated in the bill and establishes a
new unfair labor practice, and is not
germane to the committee bill or to
section 3. . . .
MR. ASHBROOK: . . . I believe this
does come under the general rule-
making. It is in section 6. Further-
more, when we refer to willful viola-
tions, on page 22, in section 7, this bill
does refer to unfair labor practices,
and I think under the previous prece-
dents established, where we open up a
section referring to unfair labor prac-
tices, it is now not timely for the chair-

Mr. Wright Patman, of Texas,
having raised a point of order
against 
the 
amendment, 
the
Chairman (20) ruled as follows:
The Chair feels that the purpose of
the amendment is not germane to the
committee amendment and therefore
the Chair sustains the point of order.

Adding
‘‘Freeze’’ to Types of Disaster

ceilings inapplicable to serv-
ices of barbers and beau-
ticians, an amendment to
govern ceiling prices ‘‘appli-
cable to manufacturers or

material derived . . . from an
agricultural commodity,’’ was
held to be not germane.
In the 82d Congress, a bill (18)
was 
under 
consideration 
com-
prising amendments to the De-
fense Production Act of 1950. To a
committee 
amendment 
as 
de-

the 
following
amendment was offered: (19)
Amendment offered by Mr. [William
R.] Poage [of Texas]: Page 18, after
line 4, insert the following:
§ 35.28 To a bill enlarging the
class 
of 
persons 
eligible

other 
catastrophes,’’ 
an
amendment 
modifying 
the
title of the existing act ex-
pressly to include ‘‘freeze’’ as
one form of disaster to be in-
cluded within the terms of
the bill was held to be not
germane.
In the 75th Congress, a bill (1)
was under consideration to extend
the lending authority of the Dis-
aster Loan Corporation. The pur-
poses of the bill were explained as
follows: (2)
MR. [HENRY B.] STEAGALL [of Ala-

‘‘It shall be unlawful to establish

than the sum of the following:
‘‘(1) The current cost of the mate-
rial used . . .

that on February 11, 1937, we passed
an act for the establishment of the Dis-
aster Loan Corporation to be officered
by officials of the Reconstruction Fi-
nance Corporation for the purpose of
making loans to sufferers from disas-
ters during the year 1937. . . .
The provisions of the pending resolu-
tion extend the benefits of the act of
February 11, 1937, to sufferers from
disasters during the year 1936, so that
anybody who was not taken care of
under the former act will be eligible for
loans under the recent legislation. Vic-
tims of disasters in 1936 will share in
the benefits of the recent act. . . .
The following amendment was
offered to the bill:
an amendment, offered for
purposes of modifying that
part of the act relating to the
use of surplus agricultural
commodities, which sought
to give the President the au-
thority to furnish surplus ag-
ricultural commodities to the
United Nations for certain
purposes was held to be ger-
mane.
In the 86th Congress, during
consideration of a bill (4) to amend
the Mutual Security Act of 1954,
the following amendment was of-
fered: (5)
Amendment offered by Mr. [Leonard
G.] Wolf [of Iowa]: On page 8, line 16,
strike out the quotation mark and im-
mediately below line 16 insert the fol-
lowing:
Amendment offered by Mr. [Thomas
F.] Ford of California: On page 1, line
4, after the word ‘‘floods’’, add a comma
and the word ‘‘freeze.’’
Mr. Steagall having raised a
point of order against the amend-
ment, the Speaker (3) ruled as fol-
lows:
The amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from California [Mr. Ford] pro-
poses to amend the title of an existing
law. The Chair is of the opinion that
an amendment to the title of an exist-
ing act is not germane to the sub-
stantive matter of the proposed joint
resolution, and, therefore, sustains the
point of order.
Sec. 401A. (a) In keeping with the
purpose and objective of the Mutual
Security Act, to assist in stabilizing
economies . . . and to help eliminate
famines and hunger in ways that
will promote economic development,
the President is authorized . . . to
furnish, 
without 
charge, 
to 
the
United Nations or to any agency
thereof, from stocks of the Com-
modity Credit Corporation, commod-
ities which are surplus, as deter-
mined by the Secretary of Agri-

the bill. The Chairman,(6) in rul-
ing on the point of order, stated: (7)
the Mutual Security Act of 1954.
To such bill, the following amend-
ment was offered: (9)
Amendment offered by Mr. [Omar
T.] Burleson [of Texas]: On page 1,
after line 4, insert: Section 2 of the
Mutual Security Act of 1954, as
amended, which expresses a statement
of policy, is amended by the addition of
the following paragraph at the end of
the statement:
The Chair has had an opportunity to
examine the amendment, also the Mu-
tual Security Act of 1954, as amended,
particularly title IV thereof, which has
to do with special assistance and other
programs, and calls attention to the
fact that in title IV there is specific
mention of surplus agricultural com-
modities pursuant to the Agricultural
Trade, Development, and Assistance
Act of 1954.
The Chair feels that this amendment
is germane to the bill now before the
Committee, and, therefore, overrules
the point of order made by the gen-
tleman from New York.
—Additional Sense of Congress
Expression
(a) It is the sense of the Congress
. . . that in order to . . . maintain
the rights and privileges for our citi-
zens who are serving with our
Armed Forces in other countries . . .
the President should forthwith ad-
dress to the North Atlantic Council
. . . a request for revision of article
VII of (the NATO Status of Forces
Agreement) for the purpose of elimi-
nating or modifying article VII so
that the United States may exercise
exclusive criminal jurisdiction over
American military personnel sta-
tioned within the boundaries of par-
ties to the treaty. . . .
A point of order against the
amendment was raised by Mr. Al-
bert S. J. Carnahan, of Missouri,
who stated: (10)
§ 35.30 Where a bill under con-
sideration 
reenacted 
and
amended the Mutual Secu-
rity Act of 1954, an amend-
ment adding to the state-
ments of congressional policy
contained in the act a fur-
ther 
statement 
of 
policy
which related to treaties af-
fecting 
jurisdiction 
over
American military personnel
in foreign countries was held
to be germane.
In the 85th Congress, a bill (8)
was under consideration to amend
Mr. Chairman, the Mutual Security
Act of 1954, which the bill S. 2130
seeks to amend, states in its statement
of policy among other things that the
Congress of the United States ‘‘de-
clares it to be the policy of the United
States to continue as long as such dan-
ger to the peace of the world and to the
security of the United States persists
to make available to free nations and

AMENDMENTS AND THE GERMANENESS RULE
Ch. 28 § 35
Article 5 of the same code says:
‘‘This chapter applies in all places.’’
So that this would purport to amend
the Uniform Code of Military Jus-
tice. . . .
Other Members spoke on the
point of order, as follows: (12)
peoples upon request, assistance of
such nature and in such amounts as
the United States deems advisable,
compatible with its own stability,
strength, and other obligations, and as
may be needed and effectively used by
such free nations and peoples to help
them maintain their freedom.’’
This legislation does not provide for
the conduct, management, or regula-
tion of American forces abroad. Con-
sequently, the amendment is not ger-
mane.
Speaking in support of the point
of order, Mr. John M. Vorys, of
Ohio, stated: (11)
MR. [JAMES G.] FULTON [of Pennsyl-
vania]: Mr. Chairman, certainly in the
first place the method of trial of United
States troops stationed abroad is not
germane in an economic and military
aid bill for foreign countries.
Secondly, attention should be called
to the statement that has been made
by the gentleman from Ohio that the
revision of United States treaties or ex-
ecutive agreements in this type of a
bill is clearly not germane to the pur-
pose of the bill.
Thirdly, as stated by the gentleman
from Texas, the sponsor of the par-
ticular amendment, if his purpose is
directly or indirectly to have a reduc-
tion effect upon the number of armed
United States forces abroad or the
number of military people in our mili-
tary installations, that policy is clearly
a matter of jurisdiction of the House
Armed Services Committee, and is not
in any way connected with or germane
to this legislation. . . .
MR. [FRANK T.] BOW [of Ohio]: . . .
This amendment merely amends the
purpose clauses of the act of 1954, in
which there are other purposes other
than the ones which have been re-
ferred to. This does not attempt to
amend the treaty. . . . It simply ex-
presses the sense of the Congress that
the President take some action to at-
Mr. Chairman, on page 407 of the
Rules of the House of Representatives
on the matter of germaneness appears
the statement that to a bill modifying
an existing law as to one specific par-
ticular an amendment relating to the
terms of the law other than those dealt
with by the bill is not germane. Vol-
ume V, page 806, of Cannon’s Prece-
dents is cited and there are other cita-
tions as well.
Mr. Chairman, this amendment at-
tempts to amend the purpose clauses
of the mutual security law, which is a
part of the bill which is not amended
by the amendment contained in the
bill, S. 2130, which is now before the
House. . . . In addition, the amend-
ment . . . would amend the Uniform
Code of Military Justice. Article 14 of
the code provides that under such reg-
ulations as the Secretary concerned
may prescribe, a member of the Armed
Forces accused of an offense against
civil authority may be delivered upon
request to the civil authority for trial.

MR. 
[WINSTON
L.] 
PROUTY
[of
Vermont]: . . . I think if we look at the
proposed amendment we will find it
deals with a different subject matter.
The subject matter of the bill S. 2130
is mutual security. The subject matter
of the amendment is qualification of
treaties or other international agree-
ments. . . .
Mr. Vorys further observed:
. . . The fact that it is a policy state-
ment rather than a direct amendment
does not make it any the more ger-
mane.
The Chairman,(13) in ruling on
the point of order, stated: (14)
Attention is . . . invited to the fact
that the amendment does not seek to
amend the treaty-making powers, it
does not seek to amend the Code of
Military Justice. It simply expresses
the sense of Congress that the Presi-
dent should forthwith address to the
North Atlantic Council, and so forth. It
is an expression of the sense of Con-
gress going one step further than the
expressions of the sense of Congress
provided in the Mutual Security Act of
1954. . . .
. . . [T]he Chair is of the opinion
that the amendment is an additional
expression of the sense of Congress in
line with the expressions of the sense
§ 35.31 To a bill amending the
Foreign Assistance Act of
1961, which had authorized
the use of funds generated
under the Agricultural Trade
Development and Assistance
Act of 1954, an amendment
offered as a new section
which sought to amend the
Agricultural Trade Develop-
ment and Assistance Act of
1954 by adding further provi-
sions relating to agreements
with foreign nations under
which such funds were gen-
erated, specifically with re-
spect to the power of the
President to negotiate agree-
ments with foreign nations
for sale of surplus commod-
ities in exchange for foreign

That is not now before the House. The
gentleman’s amendment is not ger-
mane to any section of the bill. I there-
fore insist on the point of order.
The following exchange (17) re-
lated to the point of order:
Amendment offered by Mr. Barry:
On page 16, after line 15 insert the fol-
lowing:
Sec. 404. Section 101(f) of the Ag-
ricultural Trade Development and
Assistance Act of 1954, as amended,
is amended to read as follows:
‘‘(f) obtain rates of exchange appli-
cable to the sale of commodities in
European 
countries 
under 
such
agreements which are not less favor-
able than the highest of exchange
rates legally obtainable from the
Government or agencies thereof in
the respective countries.’’
In regard to the amendment,
the proponent, Mr. Robert R.
Barry, of New York, stated:
THE CHAIRMAN: (18) The burden of
proof is always on the person who pro-
poses an amendment. . . .
MR. BARRY: I believe it is germane.
Therefore, I am asking for a ruling to
sustain my belief.
THE CHAIRMAN: The bill before the
Committee, H.R. 11921, to amend fur-
ther the Foreign Assistance Act of
1961, as amended, and for other pur-
poses, refers, of course, to the act of
1961. In the act of 1961 itself specific
provision was made for amendment of
the Agricultural Trade Development
and Assistance Act of 1954, to which
the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from New York refers.
The Chair believes that the subject
matter of the Agricultural Trade De-
velopment and Assistance Act of 1954
is included within the purview of the
Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, which
is the bill before the Committee and,
therefore, feels that the amendment of-
fered by the gentleman from New York
[Mr. Barry] is germane to the bill. The
Chair overrules the point of order.
Mr. 
Chairman, 
the 
amendment
which I am proposing is intended to
assure that our surplus farm commod-
ities are sold on best possible terms—
specifically, at rates of exchange not
less favorable than the highest rates
legally obtainable from the govern-
ments, or governmental agencies, of
the purchasing countries.
A point of order against the
amendment was explained as fol-
lows:
—Amendment Relating To Sub-
ject Matter Stricken From

MR. [HAROLD D.] COOLEY [of North

after line 15, insert the following:
Sec. 404. The first section of the
Act entitled ‘‘An Act to authorize
participation by the United States in
parliamentary conferences of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization,’’
approved July 11, 1956, is amended
by adding at the end thereof the fol-
lowing: ‘‘Of the appointments made
by the Speaker of the House not less
than two shall be members of the
Foreign Affairs Committee.’’
A point of order was raised
against the amendment, as fol-
lows:
1961 and other general laws
related to the mutual secu-
rity program, an amendment
relating to the appointment
of Members to attend the
NATO 
Parliamentary 
Con-
ferences, which had been the
subject matter of a provision
stricken from the bill, was
held to be not germane.
In the 87th Congress, the For-
eign Assistance Act of 1962 (19)
was 
under 
consideration, 
con-
taining the following provision: (20)
PART IV—AMENDMENTS TO OTHER
LAWS
MR. [WAYNE L.] HAYS [of Ohio]: . . .
[The amendment] deals with an act of
Congress which is a separate act, and
which is not contained in this bill.
Since section 403 has been stricken,
there is nothing in this bill about any
interparliamentary 
group 
whatever.
Therefore it is not germane to the bill.
The Chairman,(2) in ruling on
the point of order, stated:
Sec. 403. The first section of the Act
entitled ‘‘An Act to authorize participa-
tion by the United States in the Inter-
parliamentary Union,’’ approved June
28, 1935, as amended (22 U.S.C. 276),
is amended by adding at the end there-
of the following: ‘‘Not less than two of
the principal delegates to each of the
Conferences of the Interparliamentary
Union shall be members of the House
Committee on Foreign Affairs, and not
less than two of such delegates shall be
members of the Senate Committee on
Foreign Relations.’’
The 
above 
provision 
having
been 
stricken, 
the 
following
amendment was offered to the
bill: (1)
. . . Just a moment ago section 403
was stricken from the bill. That section
was the only section that had anything
to do with any international group.
This amendment refers to parliamen-
tary conferences of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization. The bill itself has
the purpose of further amending the
Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as
amended, and for other purposes.
The Chair is of the opinion that the
amendment offered by the gentleman
from New York [Mr. Barry] under the
circumstances goes beyond the purport
of the bill, and therefore sustains the

Expenses for Foreign Travel
MR. [WAYNE L.] HAYS [of Ohio]: Mr.

against the amendment on the ground
again that there is nothing in this bill
relating to the expenditure of com-
mittee funds, of select or special com-
mittees, or traveling committees and,
therefore, the amendment is not ger-
mane to the bill.

foreign

programs, an amendment re-
lating to reports on com-
mittee expenditures for for-

many times that one cannot do that.
In addition, it is not germane to the
bill because we are coming up with a
military sales bill, and this bill has
nothing about military sales in it. The
amendment may be germane to the
military sales bill.
The Chairman,(10) in ruling on
the point of order, stated:
§ 35.36 To a bill amending
those provisions of the For-
eign Assistance Act of 1961
relating to military assist-
ance to foreign nations, an
amendment authorizing the
transfer of military planes to
Israel under conditions and
procedures compatible with
the basic law was held to be
germane.
In the 90th Congress, during
consideration of the Foreign As-
sistance Act of 1968,(8) the fol-
lowing amendment was offered: (9)
Amendment offered to the committee
amendments offered by Mr. [Lester L.]
Wolff [of New York]: on page 11, line 9,

(d) The President shall take such
steps as may be necessary . . . to
negotiate an agreement with the
. . . Part II of chapter 2 of the For-
eign Assistance Act of 1961, section
503, designating the general authority,
states the President is authorized to

mine, to any friendly country or inter-
national organization, the assisting of
which 
the 
President 
finds 
will
strengthen the security of the United
States and promote world peace and
which is otherwise eligible to receive
such assistance.
The Chair will hold that the amend-
ment offered by the gentleman from
New York further authorizes the Presi-
dent to take such steps as may be nec-
essary to negotiate an agreement with
the Government of Israel providing for
the sale of military planes, and is a
condition in keeping with the authority

were as follows:
MR. [ROBERT H.] MICHEL [of Illinois]:
Mr. Chairman, I offer an amendment.
The Clerk read as follows:
MR. [WAYNE L.] HAYS of Ohio: Mr.
Chairman, I make the point of order
that the gentleman from New York
[Mr. Taber] was much too late in mak-
ing his point of order, inasmuch as the
amendment had already been read and
debate had started.
THE CHAIRMAN: The gentleman from
New York [Mr. Taber] was on his feet
at the time and was recognized by the
Chair as soon as the Chair saw the
gentleman on his feet. The point of
order of the gentleman from Ohio
comes too late.
Amendment offered by Mr. Michel:
On page 48, immediately after line
15, insert the following new sub-

‘‘(e) Section 116(d)(1) of such Act is

On Mar. 14, 1977,(17) the Com-

consideration H.R. 1746, amend-
ing the United Nations Participa-

The

The bill deals only with United Na-

by the gentleman from Georgia deals
with embargoes and other economic
sanctions on any material or commer-

only with sanctions against Rhodesia,
both in the title and in the body of the
bill. The amendment offered by the
gentleman from Georgia permits U.S.
rather than U.N. sanctions to be im-
posed on products or communications
from any foreign country. It is the
opinion of the Chair that the amend-

sustains the point of order.

including line 5 on page 70 and in-

changing that law but affect-
ing

beyond 
the
scope of the bill and the law

On Sept. 23, 1977,(19) the Com-
mittee of the Whole had under
consideration a bill (20) jointly re-
ported from the Committees on
Ways and Means and Interstate
and Foreign Commerce to enable
the Department of Health, Edu-
cation and Welfare to investigate
and prosecute fraud and abuse in
the medicare and medicaid health
programs within their respective
jurisdictions. An amendment was
recommended by the Committee
on Ways and Means to prohibit
any federal officer or employee
from disclosing any identifiable
medical record in the absence of
patient approval. The amendment
was held not germane, as exceed-
ing the scope and subject matter
of the bill. The proceedings were
as follows:
THE CHAIRMAN: (1) The Clerk will re-
port 
the 
second 
amendment 
rec-
ommended by the Committee on Ways
and Means.
The Clerk read as follows:
‘‘Sec. 1125. (a)(1) Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Act except
paragraph (2) of this subsection, no
officer, employee, or agent of the
United States, or any office, agency,
or department thereof, or any Profes-
sional Standards Review Organiza-
tion or any person acting or pur-
porting to act on behalf of such Or-
ganization, may inspect, acquire, or
require the disclosure of, for any rea-
son whatever, any individually iden-
tifiable medical record of a patient,
unless the patient has authorized
such inspection, acquisition, or dis-
closure in accordance with sub-
section (b). . . .

or through the financial assistance
of, the Federal Government or not),
and (B) prevent the unwarranted in-
spection by, and disclosure to, Fed-
eral officers, employees, and agents
and Professional Standards Review
Organizations of such records. . . .
Finally, Mr. Chairman, I note the
amendment attempts to supersede all
other laws and regulations of the
United States in conflict with this
amendment. This violates the principle
of the Deschler precedent in chapter
28, section 29.4 which states that—
To a bill referring to certain provi-
sions of existing law, an amendment
repealing a portion of that law was
held not germane. . . .
MR. [RICHARDSON] PREYER [of North
Carolina]: Mr. Chairman, I raise a
point of order against the amend-
ment. . . .
[T]his amendment in its scope would
apply far beyond the purpose of the bill
and the jurisdiction of the committee.
The jurisdiction of the committee and
the purpose of the bill is to deal with
the Department of Health, Education,
and Welfare and increase the Depart-
ment’s ability to investigate and pros-
ecute medicare and medicaid fraud and
abuse.
However, the amendment covers not
only the Department of Health, Edu-
cation, and Welfare but all the officers,
employees, and agents of the United
States. The committee report specifi-
cally states, ‘‘Under the bill PSRO’s
and employees or agents of the Federal
Government may not inspect, acquire
or require the disclosure of individually
identifiable 
medical 
records.’’ 
The
Ways and Means Committee does not
have jurisdiction, for example, over the
employees of the Department of De-
fense, the Veterans’ Administration, or
the Federal courts.
In addition this amendment clearly
conflicts with the Deschler precedent
in chapter 28, section 8.1, which states
that—
MR. [PHILIP M.] CRANE [of Illinois]:
. . . Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition
to the point of order. The Ways and
Means amendment, set forth as section
5(l) of H.R. 3 as reported by that com-
mittee, is clearly germane to the origi-
nal bill and the bill in its current form.
In the first place, Mr. Chairman,
H.R. 3 ostensibly has as its purpose
the prevention of fraud and abuse in
the medicare and medicaid programs.
To achieve that objective, a very com-
plex set of provisions were put into the
original bill, including provisions in
section 5, that greatly strengthen the
investigatory and enforcement roles of
professional standards review organi-
zations (PSRO’s).
These organizations do not simply
acquire and inspect records only of
medicare and medicaid patients, or of
doctors and other health professionals
who treat only those patients. Quite
the contrary is true. PSRO’s are re-
quired to compile statistically valid
‘‘profiles’’ of patients and providers, in
order to identify, among other things,
patterns 
of 
suspected 
unnecessary
services and treatment that does not
conform 
to 
‘‘appropriate’’ 
medical
standards. In so doing, they not only

may—they must—inspect, acquire, and
require the disclosure of the records of
private 
patients 
and 
their 
doc-
tors. . . .
Mr. Chairman, I am well aware of
the precedents of this body—and I am
certain that my colleagues on the Ways
and Means Committee are as well—
that would not allow section 5(l) of
H.R. 3 to be broader in scope than the
original bill. The fact is, however, that
section 5(h) of the bill now before us
clearly extends the specter of unau-
thorized violations of patients’ rights to
confidentiality to all patients, by all
Federal agencies and departments.
There is no way for Congress to know,
in advance, precisely who will seek to
inspect, acquire or require the disclo-
sure of the data and records gathered
by a PSRO and mandated to be shared
with others by the original language of
H.R. 3. Furthermore, a private pa-
tient’s medical record can be trans-
formed into a medicare or medicaid pa-
tient’s record simply by a change in
the status of the patient—his becoming
eligible, for example, through dis-
ability, age, or poverty. The medicare
and medicaid programs have much to
fear if the kinds of safeguards provided
for in the Crane-Stark amendment are
not extended to all records of patients
and all Federal officials.
The Crane-Stark amendment most
certainly relates to the fundamental
purpose of H.R. 3, and applies only to
those individuals, agencies and depart-
ments that are within the scope of the
original 
bill. 
To 
decide 
otherwise
would, I respectfully submit, signifi-
cantly and adversely affect the very
patients who are the intended bene-
ficiaries of this important legislation. It
would create potential barriers be-
tween patient and doctor by inhibiting
free communication, since there would
be no guarantees that their jobs would
be secure or their friends and families
would be free from interrogation and
investigation by the Federal Govern-
ment. . . .
THE CHAIRMAN: The Chair is pre-
pared to rule.
The gentleman from North Carolina
makes the point of order against the
amendment recommended by the Com-
mittee on Ways and Means printed on
page 66, line 22, through page 70, line
5, on the grounds that it is not ger-
mane to the bill H.R. 3.
The bill amends several titles of the
Social Security Act to correct fraudu-
lent activities under the medicare and
medicaid programs by strengthening
penalty sanctions, increasing disclo-
sure of information requirements, im-
proving the professional standards re-
view program, and by proposing cer-
tain administrative reforms.
The amendment recommended by
the Committee on Ways and Means,
while addressing the role of profes-
sional standards review organizations
in permitting disclosure of confidential
medical records of patients under
medicare and medicaid programs, goes
beyond that issue and encompasses a
prohibition against any officer or em-
ployee of the Federal Government from
disclosing 
any 
identifiable 
medical
record absent specific authorization
from the patient. As drafted, the
amendment would supersede any other
provision of law which would otherwise
permit Federal officials to disclose
medical records, and would appear to
affect health programs which are not
medicare or medicaid related which do

was not germane.
A further ruling of the Speaker
in a prior situation was quoted, as
follows: (11)
Mr. Howard W. Smith, of Vir-
ginia, made the point of order that
the amendment was not germane
to the bill. He argued that, where
only one amendment to existing
law is contained in the bill, no
other amendments to the law can
be proposed by way of amendment
of the bill; and that, where more
than one amendment is proposed
in the bill, the question for the
Chair is whether the bill is a gen-
eral amendatory bill and thus
open 
to 
amendments 
further
modifying the law. The Chair-
man,(9) in ruling on the point of
order, stated: (10)
It does not seem to the Chair that
this bill brings the whole National De-
fense Act before the House. It only
brings before the House a very limited
portion of it, and not the portion af-
fected by the amendment offered by
the gentleman from South Carolina.
The Chair is disposed to sustain the
point of order. The point of order is
sustained.
The Chair sustained the point
of order.
Penalties Under Export Admin-
istration 
Act—Amendment
Relating to Different Class of
Penalties
The bill picks out two powers grant-
ed in the Gold Reserve Act of 1934,
from a number of other powers in that
act, and it extends the date of expira-
tion of those powers vested in the
President and also in the Secretary of
the Treasury, and continues those pow-
ers for an additional period.
Chairman 
McCormack 
then
cited prior instances in which, ‘‘to
a bill amending the Federal Re-
serve Act in a number of particu-
lars an amendment relating to the
Federal Reserve Act, but to no
portion provided for in the pend-
ing bill, was held not to be ger-
mane’’; and in which it was held
that, ‘‘to a bill amendatory of an

AMENDMENTS AND THE GERMANENESS RULE
Ch. 28 § 35
to the United States was held
to be not germane.
The following ruling (12) of the
Chair was made with respect to
the germaneness of an amend-
ment offered by Mr. Lester L.
Wolff, of New York, to a bill (13)
eliminating certain gold reserve
requirements:
penalties for violating export
controls within that commit-
tee’s 
jurisdiction, 
such 
as
revocation of export licenses
and forfeiture of property in-
terests and proceeds related
to exports, an amendment
authorizing the President to
control imports by persons
violating export controls was
held to be not germane be-
cause it was a penalty not
within the class covered by
the title and by the Export
Administration Act, and was
a matter within the jurisdic-
tion of another committee
(Ways and Means).
The proceedings of Sept. 29,
1983, relating to H.R. 3231, the
Export 
Administration 
Amend-
ments Act of 1983, are discussed
in § 4.55, supra.
THE CHAIRMAN: (14) . . . The bill be-
fore the House, H.R. 14743, deals only
with the question of eliminating re-
serve requirements for Federal Reserve
notes and for U.S. notes and Treasury
notes of 1890. The amendment offered
by the gentleman from New York,
while put in the form of an amend-
ment to the same section of the Gold
Reserve Act amended by section 8 of
the bill before the Committee, has to
do with war debts, a matter within the
jurisdiction of the Committee on Ways
and Means and a matter not involved
in the subject before the Committee of
the Whole.
The Chair, therefore, sustains the
point of order.

THE CHAIRMAN: (16) Are there any
amendments to this section? There
being no amendments the Clerk will
read.
The Clerk read as follows:
Sec. 2. Subsections 3 (b) and (c) of
Public Law 93–110 (87 Stat. 352) are
repealed and in lieu thereof add the
following:
‘‘(b) No rule, regulation, or order in

(b) become effective may be con-
strued to prohibit any person from
purchasing, holding, selling, or oth-
erwise dealing with gold in the
United States or abroad. . . .
MR. [MARIO] BIAGGI [of New York]:
Mr. Chairman, I offer an amendment.

propriations for those con-
tributions,

amendment

on the use of United States

On July 2, 1974,(15) during con-
sideration of a bill continuing
United States participation under
the 
International 
Development
Association Act (H.R. 15465), an
amendment prohibiting the use of
United States contributions as
loans for the purchase of nuclear
weapons or materials was held
germane as a restriction on the
use of loans by recipient nations
which added to several restric-
tions already contained in the Act:
The Clerk read as follows:
Amendment offered by Mr. Biaggi:
Page 2, immediately after line 9, in-
sert the following new section:
Sec. 2. The International Develop-
ment Association Act (22 U.S.C. 284
et seq.) is amended by adding at the
end thereof the following new sec-
tion:
‘‘Sec. 15. No moneys contributed
by the United States to the Associa-
tion may be loaned to, or utilized by,
any country for the purpose of pur-
chasing nuclear materials, or nuclear
energy technology or for the purpose
of developing nuclear explosive de-
vices or nuclear weapons.’’. . .
Be it enacted by the Senate and
House 
of 
Representatives 
of 
the
United States of America in Congress
assembled, That the International
Development Association Act (22
U.S.C. 284 et seq.) is amended by
adding at the end thereof the fol-
lowing new section:
Sec. 14. (a) The United States Gov-
ernor is hereby authorized to agree
on behalf of the United States to pay
to the Association four annual in-
stallments of $375,000,000 each as

and where the bill amends
one portion of an existing

order, the Chair ruled that the
Biaggi amendment came too late, be-
cause section 2 of the bill had al-
ready been read.
lic Law 93–110 (87 Stat. 352). Public
Law 93–110 is the Par Value Act
which affected the gold value of the
dollar. The amendment offered by the
gentleman from New York (Mr. Biaggi)
attempts to amend the International
Development Association Act, this has
to do with nuclear materials, it is,
therefore, entirely nongermane to the
act which it seeks to amend. . . .
MR. BIAGGI: . . . Mr. Chairman, my
amendment simply seeks to add a new
section to this bill, section 15. This sec-
tion would condition any of the moneys
to be spent in the event IDA is success-
ful this afternoon, or any of the mon-
eys to be loaned, and I use that as a
euphemism because, in fact, it is an
outright grant in its nature, and we
have recognized it as such, and I do
not think anyone thinks that we will
ever have the money returned, but it
represents a condition under which the
money can be loaned.
The fact of the matter is, the money,
if it is to be loaned, cannot be used to
provide nuclear technology or nuclear
material in any of the proposed coun-
tries, and it is my judgment that the
appropriate manner in which to do
that is to add an additional section,
and we do that in my amendment by
creating section 15.
THE CHAIRMAN: The Chair is pre-
pared to rule on the point of order
raised by the gentleman from Wis-
consin (Mr. Reuss).
The bill is drafted as a continuation
of the U.S. Governor’s authority to
agree to make U.S. money available to
IDA under terms of the International
Development Association Act. That
statute already contains several re-
strictions on the Governor’s authority

enue beyond the scope of the

added to the law as a non-
germane Senate amendment.
During consideration of H.R.
2957 (18) in the Committee of the
Whole on Aug. 3, 1983,(19) the
Chair sustained points of order in
the 
circumstances 
described
above. The proceedings were as
follows:
MR. [ROBERT S.] WALKER [of Penn-
sylvania]: Mr. Chairman, I offer an
amendment.
The Clerk read as follows:
Amendment offered by Mr. Walk-
er: On page 28, after line 8, add the
following:
Sec. 308. Consistent with the ob-
jective of sustaining worldwide eco-
nomic growth and recovery set forth
in this title, section 3 of Public Law
96–389, the Bretton Woods Agree-
ments Act Amendments of 1980, is
amended by striking it in its entirety
and inserting in lieu thereof the fol-
lowing: Beginning in fiscal year
1985, the total budget outlays of the
Federal Government shall not exceed
its receipts. . . .
MR. [FERNAND J.] ST GERMAIN [of
Rhode Island]: Mr. Chairman, I make
a point of order against the amend-
ment. . . .
18. International Recovery and Financial
Stability Act.
19. 129 CONG. REC. 22678, 22679, 98th
Cong. 1st Sess.
[M]y point of order is that it relates
to a balanced budget for the United
States and is therefore not germane to
that part of the legislation before us.
Title III of the legislation provides
for U.S. contributions to the IMF, as
well as certain conditions and restric-
tions of those contributions and on
lending by U.S. banks. The title does
not address the far broader issues of
overall Federal Government spending
and taxing raised by this amendment.
The amendment also has a different
fundamental purpose from title III, in
that it seeks to impose limitations on
aggregate receipts and expenditures of
the Federal Government, which has
nothing to do with the purposes of the
IMF legislation.
The mere fact that previous non-
germane amendments dealing with
budget outlays and receipts have been
attached to IMF legislation in past
Congresses does not make the amend-
ment germane. The amendment must
be germane to the bill, not to the un-
derlying law being amended in the bill.
Deschler’s Procedure, chapter 28,
section 27.
I ask the Chair to rule the amend-
ment out of order. . . .
MR. WALKER: Mr. Chairman, the
amendment that I have placed before
the House relates precisely to the law
to which this particular piece of legis-
lation speaks. And let me also cite
Deschler’s Procedure. Deschler’s Proce-
dure, 28.55, says that a bill amending
several sections of an existing law may
be sufficiently comprehensive to permit
amendments which are germane to
other sections of that law.
That is precisely what I am doing
here. The language of this amendment
8876
AMENDMENTS AND THE GERMANENESS RULE
Ch. 28 § 35
The Clerk read as follows:
Amendment offered by Mr. Walk-
er: On page 28, after line 8, add the
following:
Sec. 308. Consistent with the ob-
jective of sustaining worldwide eco-
nomic growth and recovery set forth
in this title, Congress reaffirms its
commitment to the mandates re-
quired under section 7 of Public Law
95–435, the Bretton Woods Agree-
ments 
Act 
Amendments 
of
1978. . . .
relates to balanced budget language
that is in the present law. This bill
amends several sections of that law.
So, therefore, this particular amend-
ment is entirely germane to that which
is before us.
Deschler’s Procedure also says, in
section 28.57, to a bill amending a law
dealing with several subjects within a
definable class, an amendment further
amending that law to add another sub-
ject within the same class is germane.
This again is the same subject area.
We have balanced budget language
which exists in the present law. This is
in the same class. So, therefore, it
seems to me that under precedents of
the House it is entirely germane to the
bill that we are considering.
THE CHAIRMAN: (20) The Chair is pre-
pared to rule on the point of order.
Although the balanced budget provi-
sion of law which would be amended
by this amendment was originally
added to the Bretton Woods Agreement
Act as a nongermane Senate amend-
ment in the 95th Congress and was
subsequently amended in a similar bill
in the 96th Congress, the pending bill
does not relate to the entire Federal
budget.
The Chair rules that the amendment
must be germane to the pending bill, it
not being sufficient that the amend-
ment relate to a nongermane provision
of a law being amended by the pending
bill.
Therefore, the Chair sustains the
point of order.
Mr. Walker then offered a fur-
ther amendment:
MR. WALKER: Mr. Chairman, I offer
an amendment.
MR. ST GERMAIN: Mr. Chairman, I
raise a point of order against the
amendment. . . .
[T]he amendment relates to a bal-
anced budget for the United States and
is therefore not germane to that part of
the legislation before us. Title III of
the legislation provides for U.S. con-
tributions to the IMF, as well as cer-
tain conditions and restrictions on
those contributions and on lending by
U.S. banks. The title does not address
the far broader issues of overall Fed-
eral Government spending and taxing
raised by this amendment.
The amendment also has a different
fundamental purpose from title III, in
that it seeks to impose limitations on
aggregate receipts and expenditures of
the Federal Government, which has
nothing to do with the purposes of the
IMF legislation.
The mere fact that previous non-
germane amendments dealing with
budget outlays and receipts have been
attached to IMF legislation in past
Congresses does not make this amend-
ment germane. The amendment must
be germane to the bill, not to the un-
derlying law being amended in the bill.

I ask the Chair to rule the amend-
ment out of order. . . .

and, second, exempt from the
definition of such term cer-
tain institutions controlling
banks engaged primarily in
foreign business, an amend-
ment to a third section of the
act to change the definition
of the word ‘‘company’’ to in-
clude partnerships was held
to be germane.
In the 91st Congress, a bill (1)
was under consideration amend-
ing the Bank Holding Company
Act of 1956. During consideration
of the bill, an amendment had
been offered as follows,(2) and sub-
sequently adopted: G5(3)
Amendment offered by Mr. [Thomas
L.] Ashley [of Ohio]: Page 12, strike
lines 18 through 21 and insert in lieu
thereof the following:
MR. WALKER: Mr. Chairman, in the
case of this amendment, it does two
things. No. 1, it speaks to exactly the
same kinds of issues that were in-
volved in amendment language that
was added in the committee to the bill
dealing with apartheid. This particular
language simply says that consistent
with the objectives sustaining world-
wide economic growth and recovery set
forth in the title—so it relates directly
to the title of the bill under consider-
ation. We are reaffirming the process
of the law that was previously decided
by this Congress. This simply reaffirms
section 7 of Public Law 95-435 which
already exists. This is a different
amendment from the previous one. The
precedent cited by the gentleman—I
could agree with the Chair—applied to
the previous amendment. In this case,
though, the amendment language is
specifically consistent with the title
under consideration, and I think that
the amendment is entirely germane to
the bill that we are considering.
THE CHAIRMAN: The Chair rules that
the issues raised with this amendment
are fundamentally the same as those
raised by the previous amendment.
The issues are not germane to the bill
at hand, and the point of order is sus-
tained.
Bill and Amendment Affecting
Definitions of Terms in Bank
Holding Company Act
(b) Section 2(a) of the Bank Hold-
ing Company Act of 1956 is amended
to read as follows:
‘‘Sec. 2. (a)(1) Except as provided
in paragraph (5) of this subsection,
‘bank holding company’ means any
company that has control over any
bank or over any company that is or
becomes a bank holding company by
virtue of this Act.

foreign institution will be a bank hold-
ing company by virtue of its ownership
or control of any bank the greater part
of whose business is conducted outside
the United States. . . .
After adoption of the Ashley
amendment, the following amend-
ment was offered to the bill: (5)
Amendment 
offered 
by 
Mr.
[Chalmers P.] Wylie [of Ohio]: Page 12,
immediately after line 21, insert the
following:
‘‘(B) over any company which is a
corporation or trust if the person
controls in any manner the election
of a majority of its directors or trust-
ees. . . .’’
(c) Section 4(c) of the Bank Hold-
ing Company Act of 1956 is amended
by adding at the end thereof the fol-
lowing new paragraph:
‘‘(12) . . . activities conducted by
any company organized under the
laws of a foreign country the greater
part of whose business is conducted
outside the United States, if the
Board . . . determines that . . . the
exemption would not be substan-
tially at variance with the purposes
of this Act. . . .’’
In explaining the amendment,
the proponent had stated: (4)
(c) Section 2(b) of the Bank Hold-
ing Company Act of 1956 is amended
(A) by inserting ‘‘partnership,’’ imme-
diately after ‘‘corporation,’’, (B) by
striking ‘‘(1)’’, and (C) by striking
‘‘, or (2) any partnership’’. . . .
A point of order was raised
against the amendment, as fol-
lows:
MR. [THOMAS
M.] REES
[of Cali-
fornia]: Mr. Chairman, the amendment
is out of order as it is not germane to
the bill now before us. The bill before
us is in the form of one committee
amendment. The committee amend-
ment deals with section 2(a) of the
Bank Holding Company Act. It then on
line 22 proceeds to jump to section 4(c)
of the Bank Holding Act. The amend-
ment offered by the gentleman from
Ohio goes to 2(b) and there is no men-
tion in the bill before us of section 2(b)
of the Bank Holding Company Act.
In defense of the amendment,
the proponent stated as follows:
MR. WYLIE: Mr. Chairman, the prin-
ciple is well established that in passing
on the germaneness of an amendment,
Mr. Chairman, this amendment is
concerned with the criteria for deter-
mining whether or not a company is a
bank holding company for purposes of
the 1956 act, as amended. The bill be-
fore us, H.R. 6778, defines a bank
holding company as any company that
directly or indirectly owns or controls
25 percent or more of the voting shares
of any bank. . . .
Testimony before our committee in-
dicated that in some instances compa-
nies might seek to avoid coverage of
the act by keeping their stock owner-
ship at less than 25 percent. My
amendment simply modifies H.R. 6778
by providing that actual control of any
bank, even at less than 25 percent, is
sufficient to require the controlling
company to register as a bank holding
company. . . .
Second, Mr. Chairman, my amend-
ment makes it clear, subject to action
by the Federal Reserve Board, that no

8879
DESCHLER-BROWN PRECEDENTS
Ch. 28 § 35
. . . The fact that there was no
point of order raised to the Ashley
amendment allowed the Ashley amend-
ment to be considered and adopted by
the committee and that changed the
tenor of the bill to the extent that the
language therein be changed, and the
committee amendment now under con-
sideration amends sections 2(a) and
4(c) of the act. These two sections, and
the amendment proposed to them, are
unrelated. The committee report on the
pending bill discloses that the com-
mittee amendment does two things:
Subjects single bank holding compa-
nies to the 1956 act and changes the
existing law with respect to what par-
ticular nonbanking activities are pro-
hibited to them.
It is a well-established principle of
the germaneness rule that where a bill
amends existing law in two or more
unrelated respects, other amendments
to that law may be germane. . . .
Section 2(b) of existing law . . . de-
fines the word ‘‘company’’ as it is used
in the term ‘‘bank holding company’’
and elsewhere in the act. . . .
Since the committee amendment
amends two provisions of existing law
and opened up for consideration the
meaning of the term ‘‘bank holding
company,’’ . . . words within or depend-
ent upon that term, even if defined
elsewhere in the act, are also subject to
interpretation and definition.
The Chair holds the amendment ger-
mane and overrules the point of order.
Bill Amending Federal Reserve
Act—Amendment To Permit
National Banks To Purchase
Certain 
Banks 
Under 
An-
other Law
the Chair considers the relationship of
the amendment to the bill as modified
by the Committee of the Whole at the
time the amendment is offered, and
not as originally referred to the com-
mittee—Cannon’s Procedure, page 200.
Mr. Chairman, in the light of this
principle, the attention of the Chair is
respectfully directed to the present sta-
tus of the committee amendment,
which under the rule is considered as
an original bill for the purpose of
amendment. The Committee of the
Whole has adopted, among others, the
Ashley amendment, which completely
rewrites the definition of ‘‘bank holding
company’’ in the Bank Holding Com-
pany Act.
It is obvious that the legal signifi-
cance of the definition of ‘‘bank holding
company’’ depends in turn on the defi-
nition of ‘‘company.’’ It is equally obvi-
ous that a change in the definition of
‘‘company’’ will, to that extent, modify
the definition of ‘‘bank holding com-
pany.’’
My 
amendment, 
Mr. 
Chairman,
amends the definition of ‘‘company’’ so
as to include partnerships. I think it is
clear, Mr. Chairman, that my amend-
ment thereby modifies the definition of
‘‘bank holding company’’—indeed, Mr.
Chairman, this is its principal purpose.
By adopting the Ashley amendment,
the Committee of the Whole nec-
essarily made in order any amendment
proposing a germane modification of
the bill as so amended, in accord with
the principle which I stated at the be-
ginning of my remarks. . . .
The Chairman,(6) in ruling on
the point of order, stated:

MR. [JAMES A.] MATTOX [of Texas]:
Mr. Chairman, I offer an amendment.
The Clerk read as follows:
Amendment 
offered 
by 
Mr.
Mattox: Add a new section:
Sec. 8. Section 5136 of the Revised
Statutes (12 U.S.C. 24(7)) is amend-
ed by inserting before the period at
the end thereof the following: ‘‘: Pro-
vided further, That, notwithstanding
any other provision of this para-
graph, the association may purchase
for its own account shares of stock of
a bank insured by the Federal De-
posit Insurance Corporation if the
stock of such bank is owned exclu-
sively by other banks and if such
bank is engaged exclusively in pro-
viding banking services for other
banks and their officers, directors, or
employees, but in no event shall the
total amount of such stock held by
the association exceed at any time 10
per centum of its capital stock and
paid in and unimpaired surplus, and
in no event shall the purchase of
such stock result in the association’s
acquiring more than 5 per centum of
any class of voting securities of such
bank’’. . . .
particular 
purpose, 
an
amendment to another law
not related to the same sub-
ject is not germane; thus, to
a bill amending several sec-
tions of the Federal Reserve
Act to expand the authority
of the Federal Reserve Board
to manage the national mon-
etary supply by providing
mandatory reserve require-
ments and by imposing other
requirements 
on 
member
banks, an amendment to an-
other law to permit national
banks 
to 
purchase 
small
banker-owned 
banks 
was
conceded to be nongermane
since unrelated to the Fed-
eral Reserve Act.
During consideration of H.R.
7 (7)
in the Committee of the
Whole on July 20, 1979,(8) a point
of order was conceded and sus-
tained against the amendment de-
scribed above. The proceedings
were as follows:

eral Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 461) is
amended (1) by changing ‘‘member
bank’’ to read ‘‘depository institu-
tion’’ each place it appears therein,
and (2) by adding at the end thereof
the following: ‘‘The Board shall exer-
cise its authority to define the term

MR. [CHALMERS P.] WYLIE [of Ohio]:
. . . The amendment is clearly not ger-
mane to this bill. I might say I have
some sympathy with the gentleman’s
amendment, but it is a rather com-
plicated amendment which ought to be
debated more fully than we have time
here today to do, in my judgment. This
bill we have before us today is a bill to
facilitate the implementation of mone-
tary policy and to promote competitive
equality among depository institutions.

‘‘(C) In order to provide for the

MR. [FERNAND J.] ST GERMAIN [of
Rhode Island]: . . . Mr. Chairman, I
make a point of order against the so-
called Johnson amendment to H.R.
11221.
This section merely provides full
Federal 
insurance 
on 
such 
funds
placed in financial institutions, and re-
stricts itself to that.
The amendment before us speaks to
the question of what interest rates
may be offered to such funds and,
therefore, is not germane since it is be-
yond the scope of the legislation con-
tained in H.R. 11221, as well as this
particular section.

Ch. 28 § 35
with insurance of deposits, and my
amendment deals with the interest or
dividends payable on those deposits.
However, I must insist that the pur-
pose and thrust be examined, rather
than just the language.
The reason for extending full insur-
ance of these deposits is to influence
the custodians of these public funds in
their decisions as to where they will be
deposited—that is the stated purpose
of this bill, as reported by the Banking
and Currency Committee and as dis-
cussed here on the House floor today.
In no way does my amendment de-
part from this same fundamental pur-
pose—it seeks to use the powers of the
same regulatory agencies to influence
the same deposits of the same public
depositors 
in 
the 
same 
institu-
tions. . . .
THE CHAIRMAN: (11) The Chair is pre-
pared to rule.
The gentleman from Rhode Island
(Mr. St Germain) makes the point of
order that the amendment offered by
the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.
Johnson) is not germane to the bill
H.R. 11221. . . .
The pending bill provides for full de-
posit insurance coverage for deposits of
public funds in various types of sav-
ings institutions without regard to the
existing $20,000 ceiling, and provides
for an increase in the present $20,000
ceiling on deposit insurance for indi-
vidual accounts to $50,000. The bill is
thus limited in scope to the question of
amount and extent of deposit insur-
ance.
The proposed amendment provides
that in order to assure equality of in-
MR. JOHNSON of Pennsylvania: . . .
Mr. Chairman, I rise to defend the
amendment against the point of order
raised by the gentleman from Rhode
Island. The amendment is indeed ger-
mane to the fundamental purpose of
the bill before us today. On its face,
the bill provides full insurance of the
deposits of public units in all insured
banks and institutions. As such, it is
designed and intended to make a basic
change in the relationships between
the financial institutions which are
regulated by the Federal Reserve, the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corpora-
tion, and the Federal Home Loan Bank
Board—the intention is to redistribute
the deposits among these institutions.
In the bill, the primary method for
achieving this redistribution is through
the provision of insurance. Whereas,
public deposits are presently limited
for all practical purposes to commercial
banks, which can supplement their ac-
count insurance with the protection af-
forded by the pledging of collateral to
secure these public deposits—and this
pledging is required in most instances
by State law—the thrust of the pend-
ing legislation is to enable thrift insti-
tutions, savings and loan associations,
and mutual savings banks in par-
ticular, to accept these public deposits.
My amendment would only serve to
modify these terms and conditions
under which the deposits of public
funds would be accepted by the finan-
cial institutions involved. The same
fundamental purpose would be sought
by amendment as by the bill itself,
that of regulating the flow of public
funds between these institutions. . . .
It is claimed that the difference in
terms on its face makes my amend-
ment nongermane, since the bill deals

conference report which au-

On Mar. 26, 1975,(12)
during
consideration of the conference re-
port on H.R. 2166,(13) it was held
that to a proposition seeking to re-
duce tax liabilities of individuals
and businesses by providing di-

to provide rebates to recipients
under retirement and survivor
benefit programs was not ger-

On September 8, 1966, Chairman
Boland, the gentleman from Massachu-

ment amending several banking acts
relating to interest rates, and amend-
ing one subsection of the Federal De-

proposing further modifications to the
latter act to increase the insurance
coverage on deposits was not germane.
In that case, the Chair, citing ‘‘Can-

that where it is proposed to amend ex-

ment to amend the law in another re-

vision very specifically rebating funds
to individuals under title I. The meas-
ure included in this conference report
does not affect the trust fund in any
way. It does not in any way amend the
Social Security Code.
In the statement of the managers we
say the following:
The 
conferees 
emphasize 
that
these payments are not Social Secu-
rity benefits in any sense, but are in-
tended to provide to the aged, blind,
and disabled a payment comparable
in nature to the tax rebate which the
bill provides to those who are work-
ing.
Therefore, in a broadly based bill
such as this kind, where various kinds
of rebates are passed along to different
segments of the public, it seems to me
that this is perfectly within the scope
of the bill and should be determined
germane to the bill. . . .
THE SPEAKER: (14) The Chair is pre-
pared to rule.
Title V of the Senate amendment in
the nature of a substitute ‘‘Miscella-
neous Provisions’’ contained sections
which did not amend the Internal Rev-
enue Code and which could not be con-
sidered germane to any portion of the
House-passed bill or the bill as a
whole. Specifically, section 501 of the
Senate amendment providing a special
payment to recipients of benefits under
certain retirement and survivor benefit
programs, a modification of which was
incorporated into section 702 of the
conference report, is not germane to
the House-passed bill. That provision
is not related to the Internal Revenue
Code and would provide an authoriza-
tion of appropriations from the Treas-
ury.
ment Act of 1935, the Railroad Retire-
ment Act of 1937, or the Railroad Re-
tirement Act of 1974, or

security income benefits program es-
tablished by title XVI of the Social Se-
curity Act; . . .
(c) COORDINATION WITH OTHER FED-
ERAL PROGRAMS.—Any payment made
by the Secretary of the Treasury under
this section to any individual shall not
be regarded as income (or, in the cal-
endar year 1975, as a resource) of such
individual (or of the family of which he
is a member) for purposes of any Fed-
eral or State program which under-
takes to furnish aid or assistance to in-
dividuals or families, where eligibility
to receive such aid or assistance (or the
amount of such aid or assistance)
under such program is based on the
need therefor of the individual or fam-
ily involved. . . .
MR. [BARBER B.] CONABLE [Jr., of
New York]: I make a point of order
against the conference report on the
ground that it contains matter which is
in violation of clause 7, rule XVI.
The nongermane matter I am specifi-
cally referring to is that section of the
report dealing with a rebate to social
security recipients. This section ap-
pears as section 702 of the conference
report on page 55. . . .
There is clearly nothing in the House
bill dealing with social security mat-
ters. There is nothing relating to a
trust fund or the relationship of trust
fund and general fund.
For that reason, Mr. Speaker, it
seems to me that this . . . is clearly
outside the scope of the House bill.

Mr. Speaker, I make a point of order

that I am specifically referring to is
that section of the report dealing with
section 701, providing certain unem-
ployment compensation benefits. . . .
I have looked over the House bill,
and I can find no reference therein to
unemployment compensation benefits.
As nearly as I can figure it, this par-

nongermane amendment and has no

As the Speaker well knows, I am
sure, from listening carefully to the ex-
planations regarding previous points of
order, at no point during the consider-
ation of the House-passed bill is there
any mention of foreign taxation and
the dealings of foreign taxes insofar as
American corporations and their sub-
sidiaries are concerned.
Title I of the 1975 tax bill dealt with
the refund for 1974 taxes. Title II dealt
with reductions in individual income
taxes. Title III dealt with certain
changes in business taxes, the title
which dealt with the investment tax
credit or income tax total, particularly
as related to small businesses.
This particular provision, Mr. Speak-
er, in no way deals with a matter that
was covered, mentioned, or dealt with
by the bill that is presented to the
House, or voted upon by the House.
. . .
MR. [AL] ULLMAN [of Oregon]: . . .
Mr. Speaker, the bill that the House
passed had a great many diverse sec-
tions in it; it had credits. The matter
that has been raised is an amendment
to the Internal Revenue Code very
clearly, and much of it is in the way of
a credit. We have dealt with credits
here both for individuals and for cor-
porations in the bill that the House
passed.
It seems to me that in a bill of this
scope and in a bill that deals as broad-
ly with tax credits and matters such as
this that does involve an amendment
to the Internal Revenue Code, it is
very clearly within the province of the
bill, and should be ruled germane.
House bill.—No provision.
Senate 
amendment.—The 
Senate
amendment repeals the foreign tax
credit on all foreign oil-related income
and allows any taxes on that income as
a deduction. The amendment also pro-
vides that foreign oil-related income is

con-
ference substitute modifies the Senate
amendment and applies a strict limita-
tion on the use of foreign tax credits
from foreign oil extraction income and

now provides that within certain limits

change those conditions and one of the
limitations we impose is to say that no
one shall become a citizen of the

act. That in no wise changes or any
manner affects the present immigra-

lows: (6)
MR. [CARL] VINSON [of Georgia]: Mr.
Chairman, I reserve a point of order on
the amendment on the ground that the
amendment is not germane to the bill
which is to provide for special registra-
tion of certain medical, dental, and al-
lied specialist categories and does not
embrace the subject matter which the
gentleman is seeking to add to the bill
by his amendment.
The Chairman (7) sustained the
point of order. He stated: (8)
§ 35.56 To a bill to amend the
Selective Service Act of 1948
to provide for special reg-
istration, classification, and
induction of certain medical
and dental and ‘‘allied spe-
cialists,’’ an amendment re-
lating to induction of aliens
was held to be not germane.
In the 81st Congress, during
consideration of a bill (4) to amend
the Selective Service Act of 1948,
the following amendment was of-
fered: (5)
Amendment offered by Mr. [Mike]
Mansfield [of Montana]: Page 8, line

AMENDMENTS AND THE GERMANENESS RULE
Ch. 28 § 35
tleman from Montana goes far beyond
the scope of the bill now before us and
therefore sustains the point of order.
Bill Amending Various Edu-
cation 
Acts—Amendment
Making Principles of Civil
Rights Act Applicable in Ad-
ministration of Programs
Health, Education, and Welfare or
the United States Office of Edu-
cation . . . affecting . . . administra-
tion of programs authorized by this
Act or by any Act amended by this
Act shall contain immediately fol-
lowing each substantive provision of
such rules . . . citations to the . . .
statutory law upon which such provi-
sion is based. All such rules . . .
guidelines, interpretations, or orders
shall be uniformly applied and en-
forced throughout the fifty States.
A point of order was raised
against the amendment, as fol-
lows:
MR. [BYRON G.] ROGERS [of Colo-
rado]: Mr. Chairman, I make a point of
order against the amendment which
has been offered by the gentlewoman
from Oregon [Mrs. Green], based upon
the proposition that the gentlewoman
makes references to rules and regula-
tions promulgated pursuant to titles IV
and VI of the Civil Rights Act.
And then she goes into a question of
guidelines. . . . [T]he reference to
guidelines is not an amendment to any
piece of legislation that is being consid-
ered by us at this time, and therefore
is out of order and not germane.
§ 35.57 To a bill amending var-
ious education acts and pro-
viding 
new 
authorizations
for 
education 
grants 
to
states, an amendment de-
signed to insure that admin-
istration of programs author-
ized by the bill or amended
acts conform to principles es-
tablished by the Civil Rights
Act of 1964 was held to be
germane.
In the 90th Congress, during
consideration of the Elementary
and 
Secondary 
Education 
Act
Amendments of 1967,(9) the fol-
lowing 
amendment 
was 
of-

The Chairman,(11) in ruling on

that this amendment is specifically, by

tion of student admission
quotas not only in institu-
tions of higher education but
also in public preschool, ele-
mentary and secondary pro-
grams was held more general
in scope and not germane.
On May 12, 1976,(12) during con-
sideration of H.R. 12851 (13) in the
Committee of the Whole, the
Chair, in sustaining a point of
order against an amendment, held
that to a bill amending and ex-
tending various laws relating to
higher education, an amendment
imposing 
restrictions 
on 
pre-
school, elementary and secondary
education policy broadened the
scope of the bill and was not ger-

serting ‘‘(a)’’ immediately after ‘‘Sec.

following new subsection:
‘‘(b) It shall be unlawful for the Sec-
retary to require the imposition of
quotas, goals, or any other numerical
requirements on the student admission
practice of a State or local educational
agency or institution of higher edu-
cation, community college school, agen-
cy offering a pre-school program, or
other educational institution receiving
Federal funds, whether directly or in-
directly, under any provision of law,
and funds shall not be deferred or lim-
ited on the basis of failure to comply
with 
such 
numerical 
require-
ments.’’ . . .
MR. [FRANK] THOMPSON [Jr., of New
Jersey]: Mr. Chairman, I make the
point of order—I respectfully regret
that I must do so, I will say to my
friend from Pennsylvania—that the
amendment is nongermane.
Mr. Chairman, this is a higher edu-
cation bill. While a very few of these
provisions may have an impact on sec-
ondary schools, it is entirely indirect.
The great majority of the bill, more
than 90 percent, is in higher education.
As a matter of fact, 100 percent of it is.
This can only be characterized as a
higher education bill.
The gentleman’s amendment deals
with the admissions practices of ele-
mentary and secondary schools, and
even preschools. That subject matter is
completely foreign to the subject mat-
ter of the bill. I repeat, it is a higher
education bill.
8892
AMENDMENTS AND THE GERMANENESS RULE
Ch. 28 § 35
sylvania (Mr. Eshleman) contains a
prohibition against certain require-
ments with respect to admission poli-
cies by the language of the amend-
ment, ‘‘. . . a State or local edu-
cational agency,’’ or further by the lan-
guage of the amendment, ‘‘. . . agency
offering a pre-school program,’’ or, in
even broader language contained in
the 
amendment, 
‘‘. . . other 
edu-
cational institution receiving Federal
funds—under any provision of law.’’
Under the circumstances, the Chair
is persuaded that the amendment as
drafted is not germane to the bill be-
fore the committee and, therefore, the
Chair sustains the point of order.
—Amendment To Prohibit Stu-
dent Admission Quotas in
Higher Education Programs
§ 35.59 To a bill amending and
extending various laws relat-
ing to higher education, a
further amendment to one of
those laws prohibiting the
imposition of student admis-
sion 
quotas 
in 
applicable
higher education programs
was held germane as within
the category of laws being
amended by the bill.
During consideration of H.R.
12851 (15) in the Committee of the
Whole on May 12, 1976,(16) the
Chair, in overruling a point of
The 
gentleman’s 
amendment, 
by
reaching out to admissions policies of
preschool, elementary and secondary
schools, goes too far and is, therefore,
not germane. There is one amendment
in the bill, Mr. Chairman, of the Gen-
eral Education Provision Act which the
gentleman’s amendment attempts to
amend. Here too, however, the com-
mittee bill is exclusively a higher edu-
cation bill.
The committee amendment to the
General Education Provisions Act pro-
poses a 1-year extension of the ‘‘fund
for the improvement of postsecondary
education.’’ This is the only way the
committee bill amends the general
education provisions at all.
Further, Mr. Chairman, the amend-
ment deals with the institution for re-
ceiving Federal funds directly or indi-
rectly under any provision of law. Mr.
Chairman, I repeat that under any
provision of law, this is beyond the
limited scope of the bill. . . .
MR. [EDWIN D.] ESHLEMAN [of Penn-
sylvania]: Mr. Chairman, I would just
point out to the Chair that I submitted
this amendment under section 202,
which is opening section 404 of the
General 
Education 
Provisions 
Act,
which I think we have amended on oc-
casion before in this House, because we
are under the provision of general edu-
cation. . . .
THE CHAIRMAN: (14) The Chair is pre-
pared to rule.
The committee amendment clearly
refers to higher education and, with
only extremely narrow exceptions, con-
tains no matter that would substan-
tially relate to other programs.
On the other hand, the amendment
offered by the gentleman from Penn-

order against an amendment to
that bill, demonstrated that, to a
bill 
comprehensively 
amending
several laws within the same
class, 
an 
amendment 
further
amending one of those laws on a
subject within that same class is
germane.
MR. [EDWIN D.] ESHLEMAN [of Penn-
sylvania]: Mr. Chairman, I offer an
amendment.
The Clerk read as follows:
Amendment offered by Mr. Eshle-
man: On page 86, line 25, insert ‘‘(a)’’
immediately after ‘‘Sec. 202’’.
On page 87, immediately after line
7, insert the following new sub-
section:
(b) Section 440 of the General
Education Provisions Act is amended
by inserting ‘‘(a)’’ immediately after
‘‘Sec. 440’’ and adding at the end
thereof the following new subsection:
‘‘(b) It shall be unlawful for the
Secretary to require the imposition
of quotas, goals, or any other numer-
ical requirements on the student ad-
mission practice of an institution of
higher education, community college
receiving Federal funds, whether di-
rectly or indirectly, under any appli-
cable programs, and funds shall not
be deferred or limited on the basis of
failure to comply with such numer-
ical requirements.’’
The fact that the entire scope of the
act is quoted, and ‘‘. . . any provision
of law’’ still remains in, I would insist,
Mr. Chairman, makes it not germane
to the legislation to which it is ad-
dressed. . . .
MR. ESHLEMAN: Mr. Chairman, I
would first point out, respectfully, that
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.
Thompson) is incorrect. I did not leave
in ‘‘under any provision of law.’’ I
changed it to ‘‘under any applicable
programs.’’ And that original termi-
nology is not in there, as the gen-
tleman stated. I have attempted—
maybe, let me say, in Pennsylvania
Dutch—to limit this to institutions of
higher education. . . .
THE CHAIRMAN: (17) The Chair is pre-
pared to rule.
The Chair has very carefully re-
viewed the changes made by the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Eshle-
man) in the language contained in the
amendment as originally offered. The
Chair observes that the amendment
presently before the Committee is lim-
ited in its scope to institutions of high-
er education or community colleges,
and that it applies only to those insti-
tutions of higher education and com-
munity colleges which receive Federal
funds under any applicable program.
The Chair believes that the amend-
ment as presently drafted before the
Committee is germane to the bill, and
the point of order is overruled.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Pennsylvania (Mr. Eshleman) in
support of his amendment.
MR. [FRANK] THOMPSON [Jr., of New
Jersey]: Mr. Chairman, I make a point
of order against the amendment. . . .
Mr. Chairman, the fact is that there
remains language in the gentleman’s
amendment which says, ‘‘. . .
under
any provisions of law, and funds shall
not be deferred or limited on the basis
of failure to comply with such numer-
ical requirements.’’

subsequently discussed by Mr.

MR. [ROBERT J.] HUBER [of Michi-

amendment to the committee sub-
stitute.
The Clerk read as follows:
Amendment offered by Mr. Huber
to the committee substitute: Page
131, immediately after line 15, insert
the following new section:
MR. PERKINS: I insist on the point of
order. This is an impact amendment
and we have already passed that title.
THE CHAIRMAN: Is that the position
of the gentleman from Michigan?
MR. FORD: Yes, Mr. Chairman. I in-
sist on the point of order. I did not
press the point of order before the gen-
tleman had an opportunity to explain
what he was trying to do. I think his
motives are fine, but I disagree with
the result it would have. I wanted him
to have an opportunity to do that; but
clearly his amendment comes too late,
since we have already concluded title
III of the act which dealt with impact
aid.
The amendment the gentleman now
offers is not a peripheral or general
amendment. It is a substantive amend-
ment of the definition of a child quali-
fying for impact aid under the basic act
covered in title III of this bill.

is under consideration is referred to as

On May 11, 1976,(1) during con-

against the following amendment:

3 and 4, add the following new sub-
section:
MR. [CARL

of order against the amendment be-
cause it is not germane.
THE
CHAIRMAN: (3)
The gentleman
will state his point of order.
MR. PERKINS: It is funded by the Na-
tional Science Foundation, Mr. Chair-
man. It affects the National Science
Foundation; therefore, it is not ger-
mane. . . .
MR. [JOHN B.] CONLAN [of Arizona]:

this bill, has the educational resource
information clearing houses—18 of
them—across the Nation, including the
one at the University of Indiana, which
is totally computerized and which dis-
seminates information in this area. So
I do think the matter is germane.

pared to rule.
The 
gentleman 
from

makes a point of order against the
amendment offered by the gentleman
from Arizona on the basis of germane-

also within the jurisdiction

amendment restricting the

AMENDMENTS AND THE GERMANENESS RULE
Ch. 28 § 35
The Chair would state that accord-
ing to the Procedures of the House,
and quoting from section 8, chapter 28,
the following:
. . . a bill authorizing appropria-
tions for a particular program for 10
fiscal years, an amendment restrict-
ing authorizations under any act of
Congress for any fiscal year contin-
gent upon implementation of a plan
to reduce spending under the bill
was held not germane as not con-
fined to the bill under consideration.
(a) Prohibition.—None of the funds
authorized to be appropriated by this
or any other Act may be used to sup-
port, directly or indirectly, activities
of the African National Congress.
(b) Waiver.—Subsection (a) may be
waived by the President if he cer-
tifies to the Congress that—
(1) the National Executive Com-
mittee of the African National Con-
gress has taken a stand publicly and
officially opposing the practice of
‘‘necklacing’’, the practice of execu-
tion by fire, used against South Afri-
can blacks. . . .
(3) the African National Congress
no longer receives its primary finan-
cial, military, and training support
from the Soviet Union or other Com-
munist countries listed in section
620(f) of the Foreign Assistance Act
of 1961. . . .
The Chair would note in reading
that amendment of the gentleman
from Indiana that the gentleman pro-
vides a prohibition on funds appro-
priated by this or any other act, and
the Chair can find in no other instance
in title VIII as amended where there is
any similar prohibition.
For that reason, the Chair would
rule that the gentleman’s amendment
goes beyond the scope of title VIII and
is not germane. Therefore, the point of
order is sustained.

MR. [MICKEY] LELAND
[of Texas]:
Mr. Chairman, I raise a point of order
against the amendment. . . .
The point of order has to do with
germaneness, Mr. Chairman. The gen-
tleman’s amendment goes a lot farther
beyond the purview of the responsi-
bility of the Foreign Affairs Com-
mittee, and thus also the parameters
of the bill itself that we are debating
here. It reaches the interest of other
agencies that are not within the juris-
diction of the consideration of this leg-
islation at this time, and therefore it is
nongermane to the arguments that we
pursue here today.
Also, Mr. Chairman, the amendment
that the gentleman has offered goes a
lot farther than any other amendment
that has been offered here today. It is
much broader, the scope of which is too
far reaching to be relevant to the dis-
cussions we have here today under the
foreign aid bill. . . .

On June 26, 1984,(7) during con-

an 
amendment 
as 
described
above:
MR. [WILLIAM E.] DANNEMEYER [of
California]: Mr. Chairman, I offer an
amendment.
The Clerk read as follows:
The Clerk read as follows:
Amendment offered by Mr. Danne-
meyer: On page 3, line 10, strike out
‘‘paragraph’’ and insert in lieu there-
of ‘‘paragraphs’’.
On page 3, line 25, strike out the
close quotation marks and the period
at the end thereof.
On page 3, after line 25, insert the
following:
‘‘(3) For the purpose of this title,
the term ‘sex’ does not include sexual
preference or orientation.’’.
Sec. 2. (a) The matter preceding
clause (1) of section 901(a) of the
Education 
Amendments 
of 
1972

as the ‘‘Act’’) is amended—
(1) by striking out ‘‘in’’ the second
time it appears;
(2) by striking out ‘‘the benefits of’’

fits’’; and
(3) by striking out ‘‘under any edu-
cation program or activity receiving’’
and inserting in lieu thereof ‘‘by any
education recipient of’’.
(b) Section 901(c) of the Act is
amended by inserting ‘‘(1)’’ after the
subsection designation and by add-
ing at the end thereof the following
new paragraph:
‘‘(2) For the purpose of this title,
the term ‘recipient’ means—

MR. [PAUL] SIMON [of Illinois]: . . .
The point of order is that this is not
germane to this bill. The classifications
that historically have been considered
and have been considered under this
bill are race, national origin, sex,
handicapped, and aged.
The gentleman from California is at-
tempting to add a new clarification
here that is not germane to the legisla-
tion pending before this body. . . .
MR. DANNEMEYER: . . . I am not
seeking to add a new term. The term
‘‘sex’’ is in the law.
All I am seeking to do by this
amendment is to make clear that we
8900
AMENDMENTS AND THE GERMANENESS RULE
Ch. 28 § 35
seeks to broaden the scope or alter
the applicability of such law.
Therefore, the Chair finds the gen-
tleman’s amendment not in order.
—Amendment To Expand Defi-
nition of Persons Who Are
Subjects of Discrimination
do not, as the policymaking body of
this country, in terms of law, choose to
take our society down the road where
someone sooner or later is going to
argue that the term ‘‘sex’’ in the law
includes sexual preference or orienta-
tion. I am not adding anything. I am
just clarifying what that term means
today as it is used in the law.
THE CHAIRMAN: (8) The Chair is pre-
pared to rule on the point of order.
The Committee’s report indicates
that the purpose of this legislation is
to reaffirm the scope and the applica-
tion of four civil rights laws to an in-
terpretation which was generally ac-
cepted before the Grove City College
decision. It does not seek to define
what is a discriminatory act.
In other words, the bill deals with
the definition of ‘‘potential discrimina-
tors,’’ in this instance, recipients of
Federal financial assistance. It does
not deal with the definition of ‘‘dis-
crimination.’’
Because the gentleman’s amendment
would address the definition of what
constitutes discrimination, his amend-
ment would not be in order.
The Chair would cite Deschler’s Pro-
cedure, 28.2:
§ 35.65 To a bill amending a
general law but only with re-
spect to a specific issue, an
amendment relating to terms
of the law not amended by
the bill, rather than to the
issues contained in the bill,
is not germane; thus, to a
section of a bill amending
the Age Discrimination Act
only to clarify the definition
of a discriminating entity
subject 
to 
the 
penalties
under 
that 
statute, 
an
amendment to expand the
definition of persons who are
the subject of discrimination
(to include the unborn) was
ruled nongermane as beyond
the scope of the bill.
To the proposition amending exist-
ing law in several particulars but re-
lating to a single subject affected
thereby, an amendment proposing to
modify the law but not related to the
subject of the pending proposition is
not germane.
And in 28.4, Deschler continues:
During 
consideration 
of 
the
Civil Rights Act of 1984 (H.R.
5490) in the Committee of the
Whole on June 26, 1984,(9) the

Similarly, if a bill seeks only to
modify the penalty provisions of a
law prescribing specific conduct, an
amendment is not germane if it

Ch. 28 § 35
above. The proceedings were as
follows:
The Clerk read as follows: . . .
(e) Section 309 of the Act is
amended by— . . .
(3) by adding at the end thereof
the following new clause:
‘‘(4) the term ‘recipient’ means—
‘‘(A) any State or political subdivi-
sion thereof, or any instrumentality
of a State or political subdivision
thereof, or any public or private
agency, institution, or organization,
or 
other 
entity 
(including 
any
subunit of any such State, subdivi-
sion, instrumentality, agency, insti-
tution, organization, or entity), and
‘‘(B) any successor, assignee, or
transferee of any such State, subdivi-
sion, instrumentality, agency, insti-
tution, organization, or entity or of
any such subunit,
This is a very legitimate issue to be
brought before this body, but this is
not the vehicle by which to do it. This
is not the intent of it, and it does not
fall within the germaneness of this
particular bill. . . .
MR. SILJANDER: Mr. Chairman, one
of the differences is that the word,
‘‘person,’’ is mentioned in the bill sev-
eral times, whereas in the other point
of order the word, ‘‘sex,’’ was not at all
mentioned in the specific bill.
THE CHAIRMAN: (10) The Chair is pre-
pared to rule on the point of order.
This amendment amends a part of
the Age Discrimination Act of 1975
that is not before the committee. The
bill has a very narrow purpose, and
the gentleman’s amendment does not
fall within that purpose.
The Chair would refer the gentleman
to clause 7, rule XVI, the annotation of
which reads:
to which Federal financial assistance
is extended (directly or through an-
other entity or a person), or which
receives support from the extension
of Federal financial assistance to any
of its subunits.’’. . . .
MR. [MARK] SILJANDER
[of Michi-
gan]: Mr. Chairman, I offer an amend-
ment.
The Clerk read as follows:
Amendment offered by Mr. Sil-
jander: Page 6, after line 18, insert
the following:
(1) by inserting after ‘‘person’’,
‘‘(including unborn children, from the
moment of conception)’’. . . .
To a bill amending a general law
on a specific point an amendment re-
lating to the terms of the law rather
than to those of the bill was ruled
not to be germane; thus a bill
amending several sections of one
title of the United States Code does
not necessarily bring the entire title
under consideration so as to permit
an amendment to any portion there-
of, and where a bill amends existing
law in one narrow particular, an
amendment 
proposing 
to 
modify
such existing law in other particu-
lars will generally be ruled out as
not germane. Unless a bill so exten-
sively amends existing law as to
open up the entire law to amend-
ment, the germaneness of an amend-
ment to the bill depends on its rela-
tionship to the subject of the bill and
not to the entire law being amended.
The Chair finds the amendment not
germane and, therefore, not in order.
MR. [PAUL] SIMON [of Illinois]: Mr.
Chairman, I make a point of order
against the amendment.
Again it is the same point of order
that I made earlier. It is an attempt to
add a totally new definition. Again we
are dealing with the traditional defini-
tions of race, national origin, sex,
handicapped, and aged.

AMENDMENTS AND THE GERMANENESS RULE
Ch. 28 § 35
—Amendment To Extend Cov-
erage of Laws to Members of
Congress
pose the clarification of eligibility
of existing recipients for federal fi-
nancial assistance under several
statutes, an amendment deeming
a specified entity to be a recipient
of federal financial assistance for
the purposes of those laws was
not germane since it expanded the
scope of the coverage of the laws
being amended to a class not nec-
essarily covered by the class of re-
cipients in the bill.
The Clerk read as follows:
Sec. 5. (a) Section 601 of the Civil
Rights Act of 1964 (hereafter in this
section referred to as the ‘‘Act’’) is
amended— . . .
(3) by striking out ‘‘under any pro-
gram or activity receiving’’ and in-
serting in lieu thereof ‘‘by any recipi-
ent of’’. . . .
(c) Title VI of the Act is amended
by adding at the end thereof the fol-

amending several civil rights

circumstances under which
any institution currently re-
ceiving federal financial as-
sistance may have such as-
sistance terminated because
of discrimination by such in-
stitution, an amendment to
deem Members of Congress
as recipients of federal finan-
cial assistance for the pur-
pose of those statutes was
held not germane, since the
amendment 
required 
no
showing that Members of
Congress do in fact receive

as defined in those statutes,
and thus expanded the scope

of

described above as not being ger-
mane demonstrated that, to a bill

Ch. 28 § 35
MR. [STEVE] BARTLETT [of Texas]:
Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment
at the desk labeled amendment No. 1
which I offer at this time.
The Clerk read as follows:
Amendment offered by Mr. Bart-
lett: Page 10, after line 22, insert the
following:
Sec. 6. With respect to matters re-
lating to the performance of their of-
ficial duties, Members of Congress
shall be deemed to be recipients of
Federal financial assistance for pur-
poses of section 901 of the Education
Amendments of 1972, section 504 of
the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, sec-
tion 303 of the Age Discrimination
Act of 1975, and section 601 of the
Civil Rights Act of 1964. . . .
MR. [PAUL] SIMON [of Illinois]: Mr.
Chairman, I renew my point of order,
and let me say in renewing it that in
theory I am in agreement with the
gentleman from Texas. I am a cospon-
sor of a bill to cover Members of Con-
gress under separate legislation.
This, however, this legislation covers
Federal executive agencies. It does not
cover the U.S. Congress. . . .
What the gentleman is attempting to
do is to go beyond the scope, beyond
the germaneness of this particular leg-
islation, and I believe the amendment
is not in order. . . .
MR. BARTLETT: . . . Several points.
No. 1, section 504 does apply to execu-
tive agencies, and that is the General
Accounting Office.
Congress may already—and let us
take it point by point—the Congress
may already be covered in the bill’s
definition of recipient, which is, in
part, ‘‘any public or private agency, in-
stitution, or organization to which Fed-
eral 
financial 
assistance 
is 
ex-
tended.’’ . . .
Congress is also, obviously a recipi-
ent and, therefore, if Congress receives
‘‘Federal financial assistance’’ it would
be covered under H.R. 5490. Nowhere
in any of the covered acts is there a
specific definition of ‘‘Federal financial
assistance,’’ but Mr. Chairman, Con-
gress obviously must pay its bills from
somewhere and that somewhere is the
Federal Government, so that means
that there is assistance. Federal finan-
cial assistance. . . .
MR. SIMON: . . . The question is
whether the law up to this point has
covered the legislative branch. The an-
swer is clearly that it has not.
So what the gentleman from Texas
is doing is going appreciably beyond
the present law and the law has not
covered Congress for a perfectly sound
reason, and that is the separation of
powers. . . .
MR. [JAMES
C.] WRIGHT
[Jr., of
Texas]: It seems to me that the point
of order rests upon the well-established
rule that an amendment is not ger-
mane if it extends the law to cover an
entirely separate and distinctly dif-
ferent class of people than those whom
the law in its initial presentation in
the bill would be made applicable.
It seems clear to me that the amend-
ment offered by the gentleman would
indeed extend the application of that
statute to an entirely separate and dif-
ferent class of people. . . .
MR. [JOHN] CONYERS [Jr., of Michi-
gan]: . . . The amendment is not ger-
mane. The separation of powers doc-
trine, if we do not recognize it even
here in this sensitive area, we would
be inviting the Department of Justice
to come in to enforce the civil rights
laws. We tried many times to deal with
8904
AMENDMENTS AND THE GERMANENESS RULE
Ch. 28 § 35
this problem in other ways. For exam-
ple, the House fair employment prac-
tices agreement is one way of creating
the mechanism. . . .
THE
CHAIRMAN: (12)
The Chair is
ready to rule.
In the bill the term ‘‘recipient’’
means those entities to which Federal
assistance is extended.
The gentleman’s amendment deems
Congress to be a recipient of Federal
financial assistance. That does not
mean that there may not be some in-
stances in which Congress may in fact
receive Federal financial assistance,
but it deems Congress to receive Fed-
eral financial assistance even without
any showing whatever that in fact it
has that financial assistance extended
to it.
Doing that expands the bill from de-
fined group in the legislation and in
the law today to a much different
group and in that sense goes beyond
the scope of the legislation, and the
gentleman’s amendment is not in
order.
Parliamentarian’s Note: On a
roll call vote of 277 yeas to 125
nays, the Committee of the Whole
sustained on appeal the ruling of
the Chair on the question of ger-
maneness of the amendment.
—Amendment To Define ‘‘Per-
son’’ as Used in Bill To In-
clude Unborn
to the bill and not to por-
tions of laws being amended
which are not the subject of
the bill; thus, to a bill clari-
fying the definition of per-
sons or institutions which
may have federal financial
assistance terminated under
several civil rights statutes
because of discrimination, an
amendment providing that
the term ‘‘person’’ for the
purpose of the bill shall in-
clude unborn children was
held germane.
On June 26, 1984,(13) the Com-
mittee of the Whole had under
consideration H.R. 5490, the Civil
Rights Act of 1984. The bill
amended several laws for pur-
poses of clarifying the definition of
recipients of federal financial as-
sistance (including persons) who
engage in discrimination so as to
become subject to the penalties of
those laws. The amendment ex-
panded the definition of recipient
persons to include unborn chil-
dren from the moment of concep-
tion, but did not effectively ex-
pand the definition of persons who
are the objects of discrimination,
whatever its intent may have
been, a point which was noted in
the remarks of Mr. Williams of
Montana, below. Had the amend-

ment effectively defined the un-
born as possible objects of dis-
crimination and thus changed ex-
isting laws in a manner not con-
templated by the bill, the amend-
ment would not have been ger-
mane.
MR. [MARK] SILJANDER
[of Michi-
gan]: Mr. Chairman, I offer an amend-
ment.
The Clerk read as follows:
Amendment offered by Mr. Sil-
jander: Page 10, after line 22, insert
the following:
Sec. 6. For the purposes of this
act, the term ‘‘person’’ shall include
unborn children from the moment of
conception.
In the gentleman’s amendment he
says for the purposes of this bill the
term ‘‘person’’ shall, and defines the
term 
‘‘person’’ 
and, 
therefore, 
the
amendment is germane. . . .
MR. [PAT] WILLIAMS of Montana: Mr.
Chairman, I move to strike the req-
uisite number of words. I rise in oppo-
sition to the amendment.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. If my in-
formation is correct, the term ‘‘person’’
appears four times in this act and each
time it appears, it refers to a person
receiving or distributing Federal funds.
Now, if I understand the gentleman’s
amendment, he is including children at
the moment of conception as those re-
ceiving or distributing Federal funds.
What is the purpose of the amend-
ment? The amendment is moot. Un-
born children do not receive or dis-
tribute Federal funds. The amendment
has no meaning.

MR. [PAUL] SIMON [of Illinois]: Mr.
Chairman, I make a point of order
against the amendment. . . .
It is an attempt to expand with a
new definition beyond the scope of this
act. It is not germane as the previous
amendment was not germane. . . .
MR. SILJANDER: Chapter 28 of the
procedures of the House, section 9.12,
says ‘‘. . . to a bill containing defini-
tions of several of the terms used
therein, an amendment modifying one
of the definitions and adding another
may be germane.
On page 3, on page 6 and page 8 and
page 10 the word ‘‘person’’ is used,
which is substantially different from
the former amendment.
I yield to the chairman.
THE CHAIRMAN: (14) The Chair is pre-
pared to rule.
On page 8, line 24, the bill uses the
term ‘‘person.’’

against an amendment holding
that to a bill amending various
laws relating primarily to higher
education, an amendment to a law

fecting programs under that law
dealing with other levels of edu-
cation was beyond the scope of the
pending bill and in violation of
Rule XVI clause 7.
MR. [JOHN B.] CONLAN [of Arizona]:
Mr. Chairman, I offer an amendment.
The Clerk read as follows:
Amendment 
offered 
by 
Mr.
Conlan: On page 86, between lines 6
and 7, add the following new sub-
section:
‘‘(d) No grant, contract, or support
is authorized under this Act for any
educational program, curriculum re-
search and development, adminis-
trator-teacher orientation, or any
project involving one or more stu-
dents or teacher-administrator in-
volving any aspect of the religion of
secular humanism. . . .
MR. [JAMES G.] O’HARA [of Michi-
gan]: . . . The amendment as offered
says, ‘‘grant, contract, or support is au-
thorized under this act,’’ and in the
context in which it is offered the gen-
tleman from Arizona would apply it to
all of the parts of the National Defense
Education Act because he inserts it on
page 86 between lines 6 and 7, which
is all of it, as an amendment of section
603 of the National Defense Education
Act. So he goes very considerably be-
yond the scope of the provisions of the
section he offers to amend or, for that
matter, he goes beyond the scope of the
higher education laws that are amend-
ed by this particular bill. Therefore,
his amendment is not germane. . . .
MR. CONLAN: . . . I think the gen-
tleman is construing it in a very un-
necessary and narrow area, Mr. Chair-
man. We are dealing here with the Na-
tional Defense Education Act. We are
dealing with an enlargement of it. We
are dealing with a whole broadened
area of financing as part of that whole
act. I think the amendment is quite
germane, and legal counsel has ad-
vised us that it is.
THE CHAIRMAN: (17) The Chair is pre-
pared to rule.
The amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from Arizona appears in sec-
tion 201, all of which consists of an
amendment to the National Defense
Education Act of 1958. The material
contained in the bill amends that act
very narrowly only to the extent of pro-
viding for specialists and persons
trained in languages and foreign cul-
tures. By contrast, the amendment of-
fered by the gentleman from Arizona
would appear to amend the totality of
the National Defense Education Act of
1958 and impose its restrictions upon

Ch. 28 § 35
any grant or contract or funds under
that act which under other titles of
that law could go to schools of sec-
ondary and other levels of education.
For this reason the Chair believes
that the amendment as drafted and of-
fered by the gentleman from Arizona
(Mr. Conlan) expressly making ref-
erence to ‘‘no grant, contract, or sup-
port as authorized under this act’’,
thereby referring to the National De-
fense Education Act of 1958 and not to
the pending bill, is beyond the scope of
the bill and, therefore, not germane to
the language of the bill.
Sec. 711. In the administration of
the National Housing Act as amend-
ed and the United States Housing
Act of 1937 as amended and in mak-
ing available the benefits of said acts
as amended, there shall be no dis-
crimination on account of race, creed,
color, or national origin, and in addi-
tion thereto maximum preferences
and priorities shall be secured to vet-
erans of World War II and their im-
mediate families.
Mr. Brent Spence, of Kentucky,
made the point of order that the
amendment was not germane to
the bill. The Chairman,(20) in rul-
ing on the point of order, stated:
Fair 
Prices 
for 
Housing—
Amendment To Prohibit Dis-
crimination
. . . 
Obviously, 
the 
gentleman’s
amendment is much too broad to come
within the purview of the pending bill.
The amendment relates to the Na-
tional Housing Act as amended, the
United States Housing Act of 1937, as
amended. The point of order is sus-
tained.
Mr. Everett M. Dirksen, of Illi-
nois, then offered the amendment,
deleting 
the 
reference 
to 
the
United States Housing Act of
1937.(1) Mr. Spence again raised a
point of order. In defense of the
amendment, Mr. Dirksen stated:
§ 35.69 To a bill adding a new
title to the National Housing
Act to insure availability of
housing 
at 
fair 
prices,
amendments to add a section
to the act to prohibit, in the
administration of the act,
any discrimination on ac-
count of race, creed, or the
like were held not germane.
In the 79th Congress, during
consideration of a bill (18) relating
to housing stabilization, the fol-
lowing 
amendment 
was 
of-
fered: (19)
Amendment offered by Mr. Dirksen:
On page 17, after line 6, insert a new
section, as follows:
Clearly, Mr. Chairman, the bill be-
fore us is nothing more than an addi-
tional developing of the National Hous-
ing Act, it amends the entire act in
many particulars. So the amendment
before us now relates only to the Hous-
ing Act which is presently covered by
18. H.R. 4761 (Committee on Banking
and Currency).

the bill and is very definitely before
the Committee of the Whole.
The Chairman then stated:
The gentleman’s amendment would
take in entirely different provisions of
the Housing Act than that contained in
the pending bill.
The point of order is sustained.
adding at the end thereof the following
new sentence: ‘‘Such rules and regula-
tions may include provisions author-
izing payment to individuals and fami-
lies of fixed amounts (not to exceed
$100 in any case) in lieu of their re-
spective 
reasonable 
and 
necessary
moving expenses.’’
An amendment offered to such
amendment stated as follows: (5)
Amendment and Amendment
Thereto Modifying Same Sec-
tion of Law
Amendment offered by Mr. [Barratt]
O’Hara of Illinois to the amendment of-
fered by Mr. Talle: Amend section 302
to read as follows:
Sec. 302. Section 106(f)(2) of the
Housing Act of 1949 is amended (1)
by striking out $2,000 and inserting
in lieu thereof $3,000; and (2) by
adding at the end thereof the fol-
lowing sentence: Such rules and reg-
ulations may include provisions au-
thorizing the payment to individuals,
families, and business concerns of
fixed amounts not to exceed $100 in
the case of an individual or family,
or $3,000 in the case of any business
concern in lieu of the respective rea-
sonable and necessary moving ex-
penses.
The purpose of the amendment
was explained as follows:
§ 35.70 Where an amendment
to a bill proposes modifica-
tion of a section of existing
law in some respects, an
amendment to the amend-
ment may properly propose
modification of the same sec-
tion of the law in similar re-
spects.
In the 85th Congress, during
consideration of a bill (2) to extend
and amend laws relating to im-
provement of housing, an amend-
ment was offered (3) which in part
related to authorization of pay-
ments to parties in lieu of those
moving expenses occasioned by
certain 
urban 
projects. 
The
amendment stated in part: (4)
Sec. 302. Section 106(f)(2) of the
Housing Act of 1949 is amended by
MR. O’HARA [of Illinois]: . . . It hap-
pens that in the district that I rep-
resent we have in the operation of the
urban-renewal program the displace-
ment of many long-established mer-
chants. . . . It is not right that these
small-business 
tenants 
should 
be
forced to assume this burden when
their moving is not for their own profit
or convenience, but to the contrary.
. . . The present law calls for moving
expenses up to $2,000. In some cases

and Currency).

that is ruinously inadequate. We are
asking that the amount be increased to
$3,000 to be paid only in cases where
the circumstances warrant. . . .
The following point of order was
raised by Mr. Henry O. Talle, of
Iowa, against the amendment:
Mr. Chairman, the amendment of
the 
gentleman 
from 
Illinois 
[Mr.
O’Hara] is not germane to my amend-
ment. As I understand his amendment
. . . it refers to basic law. His amend-
ment, in order to be germane, would
have to be germane to my amendment
which is under consideration.
The Chairman,(6) in ruling on
the point of order, stated:
ing Act of 1949 relating to
payments 
for 
certain 
ex-
penses occasioned by urban
renewal projects, a propo-
sition to further amend such
section by limiting specified
construction to that needed
for relocation of families dis-
placed 
by 
urban 
renewal
projects was held to be ger-
mane.
In the 85th Congress, during
proceedings relating to a bill (8) to
extend and amend laws concerned
with the improvement of housing,
an amendment in the nature of a
substitute was under consider-
ation which contained the fol-
lowing provision: (9)
Section 302 is an amendment of ex-
isting law contained in section 106(f)(2)
of the Housing Act of 1949. That lan-
guage presumably is germane to sec-
tion 106(f)(2). That being the case, the
amendment opens the entire section of
the basic law, section 106(f)(2), to
amendment, which is the purpose, in
part, of the amendment offered by the
gentleman from Illinois [Mr. O’Hara].
Therefore, it is the opinion of the
Chair that the amendment offered by
the gentleman from Illinois is ger-
mane. The Chair overrules the point of
order.(7)
Sec. 302. Section 106(f)(2) of the
Housing Act of 1949 is amended by
adding at the end thereof the following
new sentence: ‘‘Such rules and regula-
tions may include provisions author-
izing payment to individuals and fami-
lies of fixed amounts (not to exceed
$100 in any case) in lieu of their re-
spective 
reasonable 
and 
necessary
moving expenses.’’
The following amendment was
offered to such amendment: (10)

by 
Mr. 
[O.

after line 18 insert the following:
The Chairman (12) overruled the
point of order, citing the principle
that, ‘‘an amendment to a par-
ticular section may perhaps make
in order another amendment to
the section.’’ (13)
Committee Jurisdiction as Test
Where Amendments to Law
Are Within Jurisdiction of
Different Committees
(b) Section 106 of such act is fur-
ther amended by adding at the end
thereof the following new subsection:
‘‘(g) No new contract . . . or other
arrangement 
regarding 
low-rent
housing provided for under section
305 of the Housing Act of 1949 shall
be entered into . . . except with re-
spect to low-rent housing projects to
be undertaken in a community in
which the local governing body cer-
tifies that such low-rent housing
project is needed for the relocation of
families to be displaced as a result of
Federal, State, or local governmental
action in such community: And pro-
vided further, That no such new con-
tracts . . . or other arrangements
shall be entered into . . . for addi-
tional dwelling units in excess of the
total number of such units which the
Housing and Home Finance Admin-
istrator determines to be needed for
the relocation of families to be dis-
placed as a result of Federal, State,
or local governmental action in the
communities where such units are to
be located.’’
A point of order was raised
against the Fisher amendment, as
follows: (11)
§ 35.72 Committee jurisdiction
is a relevant test of germane-
ness where the pending por-
tion of the bill amends a law
entirely within one commit-
tee’s 
jurisdiction 
and 
the
proposed 
amendment
amends a law within another
committee’s 
jurisdiction;
thus, to a title of an omnibus
housing bill amending a law
within the jurisdiction of the
Committee on Banking, Fi-
nance and Urban Affairs to
reauthorize 
rural 
housing
loan and grant programs, an
amendment to another law
within the jurisdiction of the
MR. [ABRAHAM J.] MULTER [of New
York]: Mr. Chairman, I make a point
of order against the amendment, that
it is not germane to the amendment
before the House or the bill before the
House or any part of the bill or the
pending amendment. . . .
The amendment deals with public
housing. There is no public housing in
any part of this bill or in any part of
the amendment to the bill.

thereof the following new section:
Michigan does not refer in any way to
the subject matter of the legislation. It
has no possible reference to the subject
matter of the legislation.
The Chairman (17) stated, ‘‘sec-
tion 1 of this bill deals with the
sale and handling of securities.’’
Mr. 
Mapes 
responded 
that,
‘‘[S]ection 1 of the law relates to
appointment of employees and the
fixing 
of 
their 
compensation,
which is the section I am trying to
amend.’’ The Chairman then cited
a prior ruling by Speaker Fred-

that, ‘‘to a bill amendatory of an
act 
in 
several 
particulars 
an
amendment proposing to modify
the act, but not relating to the bill
(is not) germane,’’ and held as fol-
lows:
POET LAUREATE OF THE UNITED
STATES
It seems very clear to the Chair that
the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from Michigan does attempt to
modify a section of the existing law,
but it is not germane to this particular
section of the bill. The point of order,
therefore, is sustained.

AMENDMENTS AND THE GERMANENESS RULE
Ch. 28 § 35
The Chairman,(8) in ruling on
the point of order, stated:
It is the opinion of the Chair that
since the amendment refers to and
touches upon the funds collected under
this act, limiting their use, the amend-
ment is germane, therefore, the Chair
overrules the point of order.
Funds for Alaska and Hawaii
Under Federal Airport Act—
Funds for Puerto Rico and
Virgin Islands
lected under the act may be
available to any state or lo-
cality in which segregation is
practiced 
in 
restaurants,
restrooms, or in road con-
struction was held to be ger-
mane.
In the 84th Congress, during
consideration of a bill (6) to amend
and supplement the Federal Aid
Road Act, an amendment was of-
fered as described above.(7) Mr.
Robert E. Jones, Jr., of Alabama,
made the point of order against
the amendment that it was not
germane. In defending the amend-
ment, the proponent, Mr. Earl
Wilson, of Indiana, stated:
. . . The Court has ruled against
segregation. Here we are authorizing
this great appropriation, under which
we are going to spend billions of dol-
lars in every State in the Union. Yet,
there are some States in which the Ne-
groes are not going to have a chance to
work and earn part of this money to
pay the taxes to build the high-
ways. . . .
. . . I think these Negroes should be
given the opportunity to help build the
highways because they are going to
help to pay the taxes. I think they
should be able to use the facilities, the
restaurants, and the comfort stations,
and so forth, that appear along the
highways.

section of the Federal Air-
port Act to provide that the

under

an
amendment to make Puerto

similarly 
eligible 
and

In the 86th Congress, a bill (9)

vide that Alaska and Hawaii be

during
consideration of H.R. 8729 (12) in
the Committee of the Whole,
Chairman Gerry E. Studds, of
Massachusetts, overruled a point
of order against the following
amendment:
The bill before the House deals with
paragraph 2 of section 6(b). The sub-
stitute deals with other portions of the
act and also deals with Puerto Rico
and the Virgin Islands, which are not
in the present act. The point of order is
well taken, and the Chair sustains the
point of order.
MR. [WILLIAM H.] HARSHA [of Ohio]:
Mr. Chairman, I offer an amendment.
The Clerk read as follows:
Amendment 
offered 
by 
Mr.
Harsha: At the end of the bill, add
the following new title:
Diverse Amendments to Airport
and

Development
Act—Amendment Adding New
Title to Bill

Sec. 601. Paragraph (4) of section
28(c) of the Airport and Airway De-

and inserting in lieu thereof ‘‘Sep-
tember 30, 1980’’. . . .
MR. [M. G.] SNYDER [of Kentucky]:
Mr. Chairman, I just heard about this
amendment a few minutes ago. While
I support what they want to do in this,
it is a different program that comes
out of different legislation. It is an in-
novative program that we started last
year for demonstration projects for, I
believe it was, four States to handle
the State money themselves rather
than going through FAA with a direct
funding to the States. They make all
the decisions. They set all the criteria.
It is a program that is not dealt with
in this bill in any way, shape, or form,
and in my opinion is not germane to
this bill. . . .
MR. HARSHA: Mr. Chairman, I be-
lieve it is germane to the issue. It is a
§ 35.78 A bill comprehensively
amending several sections of
existing law may be suffi-
ciently broad in scope to
admit as germane an amend-
ment which is germane to
another section of that law
not amended by the bill;
thus, to a bill containing sev-
eral titles amending the Air-
port and Airway Develop-
ment Act in diverse respects,
including provisions relating

Ch. 28 § 35
In the 84th Congress, the fol-
lowing proposition (13) was under
consideration: (14)
. . . That section 406(b) of the Civil
Aeronautics Act of 1938, as amended
(49 U.S.C. 486), is amended by insert-
ing ‘‘(1)’’ after ‘‘(b)’’ and by adding at
the end thereof the following:
section that is in the Airport and Air-
way Development Act. We already
have other titles in this bill dealing
with the Airport and Airway Develop-
ment Act, the so-called AADA. This
deals with that part of the program
and I think it is germane to the title of
the bill. . . .
THE CHAIRMAN: The Chair is pre-
pared to rule.
The bill before us amends the Air-
port and Airway Development Act in
several respects and with some depth
and breadth. It deals not only with
noise control, but planning, grants and
research, and in other ways.
Therefore, 
the 
Chair 
feels 
the
amendment of the gentleman from
Ohio (Mr. Harsha) is germane to the
bill as a whole and the point of order
is overruled.
Tax Consequences of Sale of
Property by Air Carriers—De-
termination of Subsidies for
Air Carriers
(2) In determining ‘‘all other rev-
enue’’ of an air carrier for the pur-
poses of paragraph (1), the Board—
(A) shall not take into account any
loss on the sale or other disposition
of property, and
(B) shall not take into account any
gain on the sale or other disposition
of property, if the net gain (after ap-
plicable taxes) is (within a reason-
able time to be fixed and determined
by the Board) reinvested in other
property similar or related in service
or use.
For the purposes of this para-
graph, the term ‘‘property’’ means
depreciable property used or useful
in 
the 
carrier’s 
normal 
oper-
ations. . . .
The following amendment was
offered:

portion of the carrier’s mail rate
which is payable by the Board
(which portion is hereinafter referred

Civil Aeronautics Act of 1938
in part to exclude from speci-
fied tax computations those
gains from the sale of prop-
erty of an air carrier that are
subsequently reinvested in
similar property, an amend-
ment was held to be not ger-
mane which sought to relate
such accounting procedures
to the determination of cer-
tain subsidies for air car-
riers.

AMENDMENTS AND THE GERMANENESS RULE
Ch. 28 § 35
therefore, the entire amendment of-
fered by the gentleman from Massa-
chusetts is not germane and the Chair
sustains the point of order. . . .

roads—Amendment Affecting

after first deducting the net gains
not taken into account in deter-
mining all other revenue of such car-
rier from the original cost to such
carrier of the flight equipment in
which such net gains have been rein-
vested. . . .
Mr. Oren Harris, of Arkansas,
in making a point of order against
the 
amendment, 
stated, 
‘‘The
amendment . . . goes far beyond
the scope of this bill.’’ In defend-
ing the amendment, the pro-
ponent, Mr. Heselton stated:
. . . I would like to refer . . . to a
ruling . . . found in Cannon’s Prece-
dents, section 2993. . . . It is as fol-
lows:
An amendment to a section which
is relevant to the subject matter and
which may be said to be properly
and logically suggested in the per-
fecting of the section and the car-
rying out of the intent of the bill
would be germane to the bill and
thus is in order.
The Chairman,(15) in ruling on
the point of order, stated:
The amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from Massachusetts extends
beyond the scope of the language con-
tained in section 406(a) at lines 13 and
14 of the committee amendment.
The language therein contained is
very narrow in its scope and applies to
one specific phase of the operation.
The amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from Massachusetts extends
beyond loss on the sale of property, the
matter contained in the amendment;
§ 35.80 A proposal which may
amend existing law in sev-
eral respects but which is
confined to the issue of fed-
eral financial assistance does
not necessarily permit, as
germane, 
amendments 
to
other sections of that law
which involve federal regula-
tions governing the entities
being financed by the bill;
thus, to a proposition amend-
ing existing laws in several
respects but limited in scope
to the issue of federal fund-
ing of railroads, an amend-
ment to one of those laws to
require any railroad to main-
tain 
certain 
freight 
rate
practices and waiving provi-
sions of antitrust laws to per-
mit 
enforcement 
of 
those
rate practices was held not
germane as addressing regu-
latory authorities in law and
not confined to the issue of
federal financial assistance.

Ch. 28 § 35
Clayton Act, which is not, I under-
stand, under the jurisdiction of this
committee, but under the jurisdiction
of the Committee on the Judiciary,
which is a test of germaneness.
Mr. Chairman, the entire thrust of
the gentleman’s amendment deals with
the establishment and maintenance of
rates, charges, and tariffs and their
classifications and divisions, whereas
the bill itself deals with nothing like
that, but, rather, with the funding, de-
bentures, and stocks and other related
matters dealing with ConRail. . . .
THE CHAIRMAN: (18) The Chair is pre-
pared to rule.
The gentlewoman from Maryland
[Ms. Mikulski] makes a point of order
that the amendment offered by the
gentleman from New York (Mr. Mur-
phy) is not germane to the amendment
in the nature of a substitute in that
the Rooney amendment in the nature
of a substitute amends the Regional
Rail Transportation Act and provides
for financial assistance to railroads in
the ConRail system, while the amend-
ment offered thereto amends the Inter-
state Commerce Act and also provides
changes in the Clayton Act which deal
with the issue of antitrust matters and
railroad rates applicable not only to
ConRail but to other rail systems.
The Chair, therefore, sustains the
point of order.
Bill Amending Several Sec-
tions of Law—Amendment Af-
fecting 
Sections 
Not 
Men-
tioned in Bill
§ 35.81 A bill amending several
sections of an existing law
MS. [BARBARA
A.] MIKULSKI
[of
Maryland]: Mr. Chairman, I make a
point of order against the bill on the
grounds that the amendment is not
germane 
because 
the 
amendment
amends the Interstate Commerce Act
and the Clayton Antitrust Act.
Mr. Chairman, the amendment in
the nature of a substitute is basically
an authorization; it authorizes USRA
to purchase ConRail securities. The
amendment offered by the gentleman
from New York (Mr. Murphy) not only
amends these two statutes, but also
makes new policy concerning intraport
equalization. The bill is not a policy
oriented bill dealing with the Inter-
state Commerce Act, but is rather es-
sentially an authorization bill, by far,
and I think it is not germane. . . .
MR. MURPHY [of New York:] Mr.
Chairman, this amendment was adopt-
ed by this House, passed into law, and
incorporated in the 4R Act of 1976.
What this amendment does is just
restate the fact of the matter because
the Interstate Commerce Commission
and, of course, ConRail itself have
failed to implement the law.
Mr. Chairman, the amendment cer-
tainly is germane. It has already been
part of this act, and it is a restatement
of the original amendment of 3 years
ago. . . .
MR. ROBERT E. BAUMAN [of Mary-
land]: Mr. Chairman, I point out that
the substitute amendment to which the
amendment is proposed amends the
Regional Rail Reorganization Act. The
amendment itself, however, amends
the Interstate Commerce Act, an en-
tirely different statute; and as has
been pointed out by the gentlewoman
from Maryland [Ms. Mikulski], the
18. George E. Brown, Jr. (Calif.).

in lieu thereof ‘‘be voted by each
House of Congress within the period
of 60 calendar days of continuous
session of Congress after such date

may 
be 
sufficiently 
com-
prehensive to permit amend-
ments which are germane to
other sections of that law;
thus, to a bill amending sev-
eral sections of the Regional
Rail Reorganization Act of
1973, an amendment to a sec-
tion of that Act not men-
tioned in the bill, relating to
congressional disapproval of
reorganization 
plans, 
and
germane to that section, was
held germane to the bill
(where the argument was not
made that the amendment
changed the rules of the
House).
During consideration of a bill to
amend H.R. 2051 on Feb. 19,
1975,(19)
the Chair overruled a
point of order against the fol-
lowing amendment:
MR. [JOHN M.] ASHBROOK [of Ohio]:
Mr. Chairman, I offer an amendment.
The Clerk read as follows:
Amendment 
offered 
by 
Mr.
Ashbrook: On page 7 after line 24 in-
sert a new section 5 (and number
the succeeding Sections accordingly).
Sec. 5. (a) Section 208(a) of the Re-
gional Rail Reorganization Act of
1973. The sentence ‘‘The final sys-
tem plan shall be deemed approved
at the end of the first period of 60
calendar days of continuous session
of Congress after such date of trans-
mittal unless either the House of
Representatives or the Senate passes
MR. [JOHN D.] DINGELL [of Michi-
gan]: Mr. Chairman, I make the point
of order on two bases. . . .
The second point of order, Mr. Chair-
man, is that the amendment goes be-
yond the scope of the legislation before
us. It deals with sections of the statute
not currently before the House, and as
such it seeks to go to matters on which
Members of this body could not, in the
exercise of reasonable prudence and
care, have been forewarned as to the
existence of the pendency of this par-
ticular amendment, and that therefore
the amendment is violative of the rule
of germaneness and is not properly be-
fore the body at this time. . . .
MR. ASHBROOK: . . . [I]t is very clear
that the entire matter is before us. We
are talking about the bill as it now
stands, referring to a prospective date
of 60 days, when the plan would go
into operation. All my amendment does
is to change that, to make it affirma-
tive action rather than negative action
of the House that is required. I think
it is consistent with the precedents and
the point of order should be overruled.
THE CHAIRMAN: (20) The Chair is pre-
pared to rule. . . .
As to the second point made by the
gentleman from Michigan, the Chair
has examined the amendment as well
as the ‘‘Ramseyer’’ in the report on the

used, in pursuance of such
contracts, to the extent spec-
ified in the amendment, was
held germane as a restriction
on 
the 
broad 
authorities
granted in the bill.
During consideration of H.R.
6417 (1) in the Committee of the
Whole on Dec. 4, 1980,(2) it was
held that, to a bill granting au-
thorities to the federal govern-
ment or authorizing the appro-
priation of funds, an amendment
denying the use of those authori-
ties or funds to purchase foreign-
made goods or equipment is ger-
mane. The proceedings were as
follows:
bill under consideration and, in the
opinion of the Chair, the bill under
consideration amends several sections
of the act, and is so comprehensive an
amendment as to permit germane
amendments to any portion of the law.
The amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from Ohio is germane to the
section 208 of the act which provides
for review by Congress. Therefore the
Chair overrules the point of order
raised by the gentleman from Michi-
gan.
Parliamentarian’s Note: Had the
argument been made that the
Ashbrook amendment constituted
a change in House and Senate
rules by requiring a vote in each
House within a certain time pe-
riod, the Chair would have been
advised to sustain the germane-
ness point of order.
Amendment offered by Mr. Ober-
star to the amendment in the nature
of a substitute offered by Mr. How-
ard, as amended: Page 44, after line

Sec. 225. (a) Section 12 of the

end thereof the following new sub-
section:
‘‘(h)(1) Notwithstanding any other
provision of law, the Secretary of
Transportation shall not obligate any

the United States at least 50 per
centum from articles, materials, and
supplies mined, produced, or manu-
factured, as the case may be, in the
United States, will be used in such
project contract. . . .
(b) The amendment made by sub-
section (a) shall not apply to project
contracts entered into on or before
the date of enactment of this Act or
options exercised pursuant to such
contracts. Section 401 of the Surface
Transportation Assistance Act of
1978 shall not apply to any project
contract entered into after the date
of enactment of this Act for a project
to which section 12(h) of the Urban
Mass Transportation Act of 1964 ap-
plies. . . .
would introduce a Buy America re-
quirement, through which funds will
be limited, into the Urban Mass Tran-
sit Act of 1964, where none now exists,
and in so doing, it repeals the similar
provision that currently exists in the
Surface Transportation Assistance Act
of 1978. It is an attempt to amend the
Surface Transportation Assistance Act
of 1978 by adding to the statute which
this bill amends and repealing it where
it currently exists.
It may be argued that the amend-
ments made by this bill are sufficiently
broad to open the entire 1964 act for
amendment. But the 1964 act contains
no such domestic content provision.
The Oberstar amendment introduces
a new subject, and couching it in lan-
guage that tacks the provision on at
the end of the existing section of the
1964 act is not enough to make it ger-
mane.
The 
Oberstar 
amendment 
really
amends the Surface Transportation
Act of 1978, an act which itself amend-
ed the 1964 act.
I submit that regardless of whether
H.R. 6417 is broad enough to open the
entire 1964 act for amendment, it is
not broad enough to open other acts .
. . for amendments as well, and neither
is it broad enough to render germane
any new subject. . . .
MR. [JAMES L.] OBERSTAR [of Min-
nesota]: . . . I rise in opposition to the
point of order.
Mr. Chairman, the amendment that
I am offering is to the Howard sub-
stitute, which is substantially broad
enough to admit an amendment deal-
ing with the Buy America Act, which is
a part of the original Urban Mass
Transit Act. There was a Buy America
MR. [BILL] FRENZEL [of Minnesota]:
Mr. Chairman, I make a point of order
against the amendment offered by the
gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Ober-
star). This proposed amendment vio-
lates rule XVI, clause 7. . . .
Hinds’ volume V, section 5825, states
that while a committee may report a
bill embracing different subjects, it is
not in order during consideration in
the House to introduce a new subject
by way of amendment.
Cannon’s, chapter 8, section 2995,
states that the burden of proof is on
the proponent of an amendment to es-
tablish germaneness, and where an
amendment is equally susceptible to
more than one interpretation, one of
which renders it not germane, the
Chair will rule it out of order.
Mr. Chairman, the Oberstar amend-
ment seeks to introduce a new subject
which is part neither of this bill nor of
the statute which this bill seeks to
amend. 
The 
Oberstar 
amendment

of such funds to purchase foreign-made
equipment. On another occasion per-
haps the gentleman from Minnesota
(Mr. Frenzel) will recall, when he
made a similar point of order to the
Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act
amendments; and the chairman of the
committee at that time, the gentleman
from Kentucky (Mr. Natcher), on July
21, 1976, held the amendment to be in
order. These precedents are contained
in Deschler’s Procedure, chapter 28,
sections 4.27 and 23.7.
The Chair, therefore, overrules the
point of order and recognizes the gen-
tleman from Minnesota (Mr. Oberstar)
in support of his amendment for 5
minutes.
Energy Research and Develop-
ment Programs—Amendment
to Define ‘‘Research and De-
velopment’’
provision in the Surface Transpor-
tation Assistance Act of 1978, which
provided that a final manufactured ar-
ticle should be substantially all-Amer-
ican produced and established the 10-
percent price differential between for-
eign and domestic bids.
My amendment would broaden that
language, which is existing law some-
what, and is perfectly in order because
it is an amendment to the Howard
substitute and is restricted entirely to
the language of the Urban Mass
Transportation Act and does not, as
the gentleman from Minnesota sug-
gested, go beyond the provisions of the
Urban Mass Transportation Act. . . .
THE CHAIRMAN PRO TEMPORE: (3) The
Chair is prepared to rule.
The Chair has heard the arguments
of both the maker of the point of order
and the opponent of it, and the Chair
is constrained to agree with the gen-
tleman from Minnesota (Mr. Oberstar)
that the amendment amends only the
Urban Mass Transportation Act. That
law in 1978 was in effect amended by
the Buy America title contained in the
Surface Transportation Assistance Act,
and the pending amendment only al-
ters the effect of the 1978 law as it re-
lates to authorities under UMTA. On
two previous occasions, Buy America
amendments have been held germane
when offered to bills, comprehensively
amending existing laws and drafted as
restrictions on authorities contained in
those laws.
The first was on May 7, 1959, when
Chairman Bass held germane to a bill
permitting the Tennessee Valley Au-
thority to raise capital by issuance of
bonds, an amendment prohibiting use

of those laws in a related
way may be germane; thus,

at any point, which not only

ergy for a fiscal year but also

in

cir-

proceedings were as follows:

study directed toward greater knowl-
edge or understanding of a specific
subject, and toward the expansion of
man’s fundamental knowledge of na-
ture (with or without immediate rel-
evance to specific technology pro-
grams). . . .
Sec. 504. (a) Section 111 of the En-

Madam Chairman, I offer an amend-
ment.
MR. [JOHN D.] DINGELL [of Michi-
gan]: Madam Chairman, I make the
point of order that the amendment is
not germane to the bill which lies be-
fore us.
I would point out, first of all, that
the burden is upon the offeror of the
amendment to establish the germane-
ness thereof.
Furthermore, 
Madam

MR. [JOHN
W.] WYDLER
[of New
York]: Madam Chairman, I would only
point out to the Chair that in the bill
the gentleman from Michigan is going
to bring to the floor immediately upon
the conclusion of the bill we are now
considering, he amends the Depart-
ment of Energy Act in many places,
and I would be hard pressed to under-
stand how he is going to defend that
action when he is contending that
doing this is a violation of the rules of
the House. . . .
THE
CHAIRMAN: (6)
The Chair is
ready to rule.
The gentleman from Michigan (Mr.
Dingell) raises a point of order against
the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from Florida (Mr. Fuqua) on
the basis that the amendment is not
germane to the legislation. The Chair
would state to the gentleman from
Michigan that this amendment does
not amend the rules of the House.
Under the rule which provides for con-
sideration of this legislation a sub-
stitute was made in order as an origi-
nal bill, the substitute which was an
amendment by the gentleman from
Florida (Mr. Fuqua) printed in the
Record on the 23d of June.
In the substitute which was made in
order as an original bill, the energy
Reorganization Act is substantively
amended in a permanent way. The
gentleman from Florida now seeks to
add a new title following the ‘‘general
provisions’’ portion of the bill to pro-
vide a definition of research and devel-
opment under the aegis of the Energy
Reorganization Act. That is clearly ger-
the House, it is well settled that the
Energy Reorganization Act of 1974 re-
ferred to is a statute relating to the re-
organization of government and does
not lie under the jurisdiction of the
Committee on Science and Technology.
I would point out that the amend-
ment clearly seeks to amend a statute
lying under the jurisdiction of another
committee. . . .
I would point out that the amend-
ment here offered by the gentleman
from Florida seeks to change perma-
nent law, as opposed to simply laying
forth for the House the basis upon
which appropriations may be made,
which is the basic purpose on which
this particular legislation is before the
House. The amendment affects the
Atomic Energy Act of 1954.
I point out again that this amend-
ment, which is offered to a 1-year au-
thorization, is permanent legislation,
defining a rather sweeping responsi-
bility of the Department of Energy of
which I am not able to advise the
Chair of all the consequences, nor is
the author.
In reiteration, I point out that this is
an authorization bill, and it includes
limitations and procedural changes. Of
course, adoption of this amendment
does not affect jurisdiction of any com-
mittee or affect the rules of the House.
Other permanent provisions of the
amendment go much beyond the provi-
sions of an annual authorization, and
deal with what is essentially perma-
nent and lasting legislation, not only of
the Atomic Energy Act, but also again,
I reiterate, another statute not under
the jurisdiction of this committee at
all, the Energy Reorganization Act of
1974, which was referred to the Com-
6. Barbara Jordan (Tex.).

mane because of the provisions of this
bill and under the the precedents that
have been established in interpreting
and applying the rules of the House re-
lated to the question of germaneness.
The amendment obviously relates to
the question of energy research and de-
velopment, the subject of the pending
bill. Consequently the Chair overrules
the point of order raised by the gen-
tleman from Michigan.

Under 
Emergency
Petroleum Allocation Act—
User Charges for Allocations
(a) Section 4 of the Emergency Petro-
leum Allocation Act of 1973 is amend-
ed by adding at the end thereof the fol-
lowing new subsections:
‘‘(h)(1) If the President finds that,
without such action, the objectives of
subsection (b) cannot be attained, he
may promulgate a rule which shall be
deemed a part of the regulation under
subsection (a) and which shall provide,
consistent with the objectives of sub-
section (b), an ordering of priorities
among users of crude oil, residual fuel
oil, or any refined petroleum product,
and for the assignment to such users of
rights entitling them to obtain any
such oil or product in precedence to
other users not similarly entitled. A
top priority in such ordering shall be
the maintenance of vital services (in-
cluding, but not limited to new housing
construction, education, health care,
hospitals, public safety, energy produc-
tion, agriculture, and transportation
services, which are necessary to the
preservation of health, safety, and the
public welfare). . . .
‘‘(6) For purposes of this subsection,
the term ‘allocation’ shall not be con-
strued to exclude the end-use alloca-
tion of gasoline to individual con-
sumers.

amendment in the nature of
a substitute which amended
section 4 of the Emergency

not within the category of ra-

not germane.

pose it would be charged for pref-

THE CHAIRMAN: (8) The Chair is con-

effect would result in a tax not directly
related to the rationing authority con-
ferred by the amendment in the nature
of a substitute.

MR. [HARLEY O.] STAGGERS [of West
Virginia]: Mr. Chairman, I make a
point of order against the amendment

. . .
I make the point of order on the
amendment on the ground that it au-
thorizes a user’s fee in the nature of a
tax and that is not supposed to come
within the jurisdiction of our com-
mittee. That authority is delegated to
the Ways and Means Committee.
MR. MARTIN of [North Carolina:] Mr.
Chairman, I believe that the amend-
ment is germane and pertinent to the
section dealing with gasoline rationing.
. . .
This amendment does not propose a
tax as such and so does not run afoul
of the prerogatives of the honorable
Committee on Ways and Means. In-
stead it proposes an administrative fee
to be charged, much as fees are
charged by the National Park Service
under the Golden Eagle plan for use of

MR. [LOUIS
C.] WYMAN
[of New
Hampshire]: Mr. Chairman, I offer an
amendment to the amendment in the
nature of a substitute offered by the
gentleman from West Virginia (Mr.
Staggers).
The Clerk read as follows:
Amendment 
offered 
by 
Mr.
Wyman to the amendment in the na-
ture of a substitute offered by Mr.
Staggers: On page 59, after line 23,
insert the following:
(1) Section 202(b) of the Clean Air
Act (42 U.S.C. 1857) is amended by
adding at the end thereof the fol-
lowing:
‘‘(6)(a) Notwithstanding any other
provision of law, the authority of the
Administrator to require emissions
controls on automobiles is hereby
suspended except for automobiles
registered to residents of those areas
of the United States as specified by
subsection (b) of this section, until
January 1, 1977, or the day on which
the President declares that shortage
of petroleum is at an end, whichever
occurs later.
(b) Within 60 days after the date
of enactment of this paragraph, and
annually thereafter, the Adminis-
trator shall designate, subject to the
limitations set forth herein, geo-
graphic areas of the United States in
which there is significant auto emis-
sions related air pollution. The Ad-
ministrator shall not designate as
such area any part of the United
States outside the following Air
Quality Control Regions as defined
by the Administrator as of the date
of enactment of this paragraph with-
out justification to and prior ap-
proval of the Congress. . . .
(3) Section 203(a)(3) of such Act is
amended to read as follows:
‘‘(3) for any person to register, on
or after 60 days after the date of en-
MR. [JOHN D.] DINGELL [of Michi-
gan]: . . . The second ground on which
I make a point of order is that at no
point in the bill before us appears an
amendment to section 203 of the Clean
Air Act. In fact, the gentleman’s
amendment deals with section 203 and
not with the sections which are before
us.
As the Chair will observe from the
reading of the Clean Air Act, section
203 is the penalty section and relates
to certifications. Section 202(b) man-
dates the EPA to establish emission
limitations for automobiles, and it is to
section 202(b) which the bill itself now
does apply. The amendment goes much
further than that and it restricts the
authority of automobile owners to reg-
ister automobiles in States, and this
matter is not spoken to otherwise or
elsewhere in the legislation before us.
It is, therefore, my strong view, Mr.
Chairman, that the amendment before
us is not germane to the legislation in
dealing with subjects not in the bill
and not presently before the House.
Obviously the germaneness rules are
here to protect Members from being
surprised by amendments which relate
to matters different than those before
us. Obviously the amendment relates
to sections of the Clean Air Act and to
matters that are not before us. For
that reason the point of order against
the amendment should be sustained.
. . .
8930
AMENDMENTS AND THE GERMANENESS RULE
Ch. 28 § 35
MR. WYMAN: . . . [The amendment]
simply suspends . . . the authority of
the Administrator to impose [require-
ments for emission controls] for a defi-
nite period during the energy crisis.
This is so plainly in order that I sub-
mit the Chair should overrule the
point of order.
THE
CHAIRMAN: (11)
The Chair is
ready to rule. . . .
The second aspect of the point of
order is the question of nongermane-
ness in connection with the Clean Air
Act. The Chair has simply looked at
the Ramseyer on the bill before us and
it is very clear that the Clean Air Act
is comprehensively amended by the bill
and by the pending amendment in the
nature of a substitute. Therefore, the
Chair overrules the point of order of
the gentleman from Michigan.
Regulations Affecting Ration-
ing of Petroleum Products—
Amending Rules To Establish
Congressional 
Disapproval
Procedure
being amended by that prop-
osition 
contains 
a 
com-
parable provision.
On Dec. 14, 1973,(12) the Com-
mittee of the Whole had under
consideration a section of an
amendment in the nature of a
substitute which amended section
4 of the Emergency Petroleum Al-
location Act of 1973 to authorize
the president to establish prior-
ities, including rationing proce-
dures, among users of petroleum
products. An amendment was of-
fered which conditioned the effec-
tiveness of those regulations upon
subsequent 
congressional 
dis-
approval (amending the rules of
both Houses to provide for the
privileged consideration of dis-
approval resolutions). The amend-
ment was held germane, where
the section of law being amended
already contained a provision per-
mitting 
either 
House 
to 
dis-
approve 
regulations 
exempting
certain petroleum products from
allocations under that section.
The proceedings were as fol-
lows:
MR. [H. JOHN] HEINZ [III, of Penn-
sylvania]: Mr. Chairman, I offer an
amendment to the amendment in the
nature of a substitute offered by the
§ 35.86 While an amendment
amending the rules of the
House to establish a special
disapproval procedure would
not ordinarily be germane to
a proposition which granted
certain authority to the exec-
utive but did not contain a
provision affecting congres-
sional procedure, such an
amendment 
is 
in 
order
where the section of law

The Clerk read as follows:
respect to the procedure to be fol-
lowed in that House in the case of
resolutions described by paragraph
(2) of this subsection; and they su-
persede other rules only to the ex-
tent that they are inconsistent there-
with; and
‘‘(B) with full recognition of the
constitutional right of either House

and to the same extent as in the

order to move either to discharge the
committee from further consider-
ation of the resolution or to dis-
charge the committee from further
consideration of any other resolution
with respect to the energy action
which has been referred to the com-
mittee.
‘‘(B) A motion to discharge may be
made only by an individual favoring
the resolution, is highly privileged
(except that it may not be made
after the committee has reported a
resolution with respect to the same
energy action), and debate thereon
shall be limited to not more than 1
hour, to be divided equally between
those favoring and those opposing
the resolution. An amendment to the
motion is not in order, and it is not
in order to move to reconsider the

to or disagreed to. . . .

Page 8, after line 18, insert the fol-
lowing new subsection: (e) Section 4
of the Emergency Petroleum Alloca-
tion Act of 1973 is amended by in-
serting at the end thereof the fol-
lowing new subsections:
‘‘(l)(1) The President shall transmit
any rule (other than any technical or
clerical amendments) which amends
the regulation (promulgated pursu-
ant to subsection (a) of this section)
with respect to end-use allocation
authorized under subsection (h) of
this section.
‘‘(2) Any such rule with respect to
end-use allocation shall, for purposes
of subsections (m) and (n) of this sec-
tion, be treated as an energy action
and shall take effect only if such ac-
tions are not disapproved by either
House of Congress as provided in
subsections (m) and (n) of this sec-
tion.
‘‘(m) DISAPPROVAL

‘‘(3) Except as otherwise provided
in paragraph (4) of this subsection,
an energy action shall take effect at
the end of the first period of 15 cal-
endar days of continuous session of

MR. [BOB] ECKHARDT [of Texas]: Mr.
Chairman, my point of order is that
the amendment is not germane to the
amendment in the nature of a sub-
stitute. Further, the amendment is not
germane to the material of the bill.
. . .
Mr. Chairman, what the amendment
purports to do is create additional ma-
8932
AMENDMENTS AND THE GERMANENESS RULE
Ch. 28 § 35
peculiar and unusual problem, that it
is far beyond the scope of any provision
in the bill. It does not in a minor man-
ner change the bill, but it changes it in
an extremely substantial manner be-
cause it calls upon the House to make
a deep and complete policy determina-
tion with respect to the question of al-
location at a time subsequent to the
passage of the bill, and give that policy
determination the effect of law as a
condition subsequent to its particular
enactment. . . .
MR. HEINZ: . . . Mr. Chairman, the
gentleman from Texas contends on the
one hand that my amendment is not
constitutional, and on the other that it
is not germane to the bill.
On the first point I would like to in-
dicate, Mr. Chairman, that there are
already on the statute books two laws,
the War Powers Act, and the Proce-
dure for Approving Executive Reorga-
nizations. They use the same proce-
dure for the two items I mentioned.
Therefore I do not feel that the point of
constitutionality can stand the test.
Second, the gentleman from Texas
argues that my amendment and the
disapproval portion thereof is not ger-
mane to the bill. Were this the case it
would seem to me inconsistent, Mr.
Chairman, because we would not have
had, as we did 2 days ago, a vote on
the Broyhill amendment which in-
cluded the exact same procedures as
exist in my amendment.
Admittedly, section 105 is not sec-
tion 103 but, nonetheless, both amend-
ments were offered to the amendment
in the nature of a substitute, H.R.
11882. I do not believe, therefore, Mr.
Chairman, that the point of order has
merit.
chinery with respect to the allocation
section of the bill which is covered in
section 103 of that bill so as to provide
that the powers which are to be exer-
cised in allocation, including end use
allocation, shall be subject to presen-
tation to the Congress during a 15-day
period in which, if they are not vetoed
by one or the other House, such provi-
sions may be canceled by having been
denied by the two Houses.
There is nothing in the original bill
or in the amendment that provides for
any procedure by which the matter
shall be resubmitted to the Congress.
There is nothing in the amendment in
the nature of a substitute that has any
such procedure in it.
The amendment offered here pro-
vides an extensive amendment of the
procedures of both the House and Sen-
ate with respect to the manner in
which this is accomplished.
I should like to point out to the
Chair that this is not a small change
in policy or in law but an extremely
large one. What it purports to do, in ef-
fect, is to change the role of the Presi-
dency and that of the Congress and to
afford a special procedure by which
this bill reserves to the Congress the
administrative position, a position in
which as a condition subsequent to the
passage of this bill this bill may re-
quire a second look at the entire ques-
tion and a determination on the ques-
tion of policy by the Congress.
The major thrust of my point of
order does not go to any question of
constitutionality.
It indicates too the fact that the mat-
ter contained herein so sweepingly al-
ters the procedures of the House, and
the work to accommodate itself to this
8933
DESCHLER-BROWN PRECEDENTS
Ch. 28 § 35
make submissions to the Congress.
And whereby either House may dis-
approve of such submissions.
Therefore the Chair overrules the
point of order.
Indirectly Superseding Other

diction of other committees.
On June 26, 1979,(14)
during
consideration of H.R. 3930 (15) in
the Committee of the Whole,
Chairman Gerry E. Studds, of
MR. ECKHARDT: Mr. Chairman, I
should like to urge one other point
aside from the germaneness question,
and that is that the amendment is out
of order because it seeks to amend the
Rules of the House.
MR. HEINZ: Mr. Chairman, if I may
be heard further, I just do not think
that the gentleman from Texas is cor-
rect. What is in this amendment is
simply no different from writing into
the bill, which we could do at any time,
for any section, a provision which
might say ‘‘notwithstanding anything
in Section 103 or any other section, the
Executive Branch has to come back to
the Congress for enactment or ap-
proval or determination, or anything.’’
THE CHAIRMAN: (13) The Chair is pre-
pared to rule.
The gentleman from Texas (Mr.
Eckhardt) makes a very interesting
and strong argument. The Chair in its
ruling is persuaded that the question
is a narrow question. The Chair does
not rule on the constitutional questions
raised in this argument; but there are
two aspects of the matter that the
Chair takes into consideration in its
decision. One, which the Chair believes
to be the lesser one, is the fact that in
the original bill there is a similar pro-
vision which in turn was offered as an
amendment to the amendment in the
nature of a substitute. But the Chair
relies primarily on the fact that the
amendment offered by the gentleman
from Pennsylvania (Mr. Heinz) is in
fact an amendment to section 4 of Pub-
lic Law 93–159, the Emergency Petro-
leum Allocation Act which, in a dif-
ferent manner, does provide for a pro-
cedure whereby the President shall

amendment to be germane:
Amendment offered by Mr. Udall:
Page 8, after line 13 add the following
new subsection and renumber the sub-
sequent sections accordingly:
(g)(1) The Secretary of Energy is
hereby authorized to designate a pro-
posed synthetic fuel or feedstock facil-
ity as a priority synthetic project pur-
suant to the procedures and criteria
provided in this section. . . .
(h)(1) Any person planning or pro-
posing a synthetic fuel or feedstock fa-
cility may apply to the Secretary of En-
ergy for an order designating such fa-
cility 
as 
a 
priority 
synthetic
project. . . .
(i) Not later than forty-five days
after receipt of an application author-
ized under the previous section, the
Secretary shall determine whether the
proposed synthetic fuel or feedstock fa-
cility is of sufficient national interest
to be designated a priority synthetic
project. Upon reaching a determination
the Secretary shall publish his decision
in the Federal Register and shall no-
tify the applicant and the agencies
identified in subsection (h)(3). In mak-
ing such a determination the Secretary
shall consider—
(1) the extent to which the facility
would reduce the Nation’s dependence
upon imported oil;
(2) the magnitude of any adverse en-
vironmental impacts associated with
the facility and the existence of alter-
natives that would have fewer adverse
impacts; . . .
(7) the extent to which the applicant
is prepared to complete or has already
completed the significant actions which
the applicant in consultation with the
Deputy Secretary anticipate will be
identified under subsection (1) as re-
quired from the applicant; and
(8) the public comments received
concerning such facility. . . .
(l) Not later than thirty days after
notice appears in the Federal Register
of an order designating a proposed syn-
thetic fuel or feedstock facility as a pri-
ority synthetic project, any Federal
agency with authority to grant or deny
any approval or to perform any action
necessary to the completion of such
project or any part thereof, shall trans-
mit to the Secretary of Energy and to
the priority energy project—
(1) a compilation of all significant ac-
tions required by such agency before a
final decision or any necessary ap-
proval(s) can be rendered;
(2) a compilation of all significant ac-
tions and information required of the
applicant before a final decision by
such agency can be made;
(3) a tentative schedule for com-
pleting actions and obtaining the infor-
mation listed in subsections (1) and (2)
of this subsection;
(4) all necessary application forms
that must be completed by the priority
energy project before such approval
can be granted; and
(5) the amounts of funds and per-
sonnel available to such agency to con-
duct such actions and the impact of

MR. [JOHN D.] DINGELL [of Michi-
gan]: Mr. Chairman, I make a point of
order that the amendment offered by
my good friend from Arizona is not
germane. . . .
Mr. Chairman, it is well settled the
amendment must be germane not only
to the section but also to the bill.
Mr. Chairman, the bill relates to the
Defense Production Act.
Mr. Chairman, under the amend-
ment, a lengthy process is established
whereunder the Secretary of Energy,
who is not mentioned elsewhere in the
bill, is authorized to designate syn-
thetic fuel or feedstocks facilities as
priority synthetic projects, pursuant to
lengthy criteria which are set forth at
the first and second pages and fol-
lowing.
So, Mr. Chairman, there is a whole
range of broad new responsibilities im-
posed on the Secretary of Energy not
found elsewhere, either in the Defense
Production Act or in the bill before us,
which are quite complex, very obvious,
and which involve a lengthy amount of
work and which involve amendment ei-
ther directly or indirectly of a large
number of Federal, State, and local
statutes dealing with the project and
permitting the project.
There is also an extensive procedural
responsibility on both the Secretary
and one which is imposed on the Gov-
ernor of the State in which the action
would occur.
For that reason, Mr. Chairman, a
Member of this body could not very
well anticipate as would be required by
the rules of germaneness that an
amendment of this sweep and breadth
could be visited upon us. . . .
MR. [ROBERT E.] BAUMAN [of Mary-
land]: Mr. Chairman, a further point of
order. . . .
I make a point of order against the
amendment for the following reasons:
The bill before us, H.R. 3930, amends
the Defense Production Act of 1950
and it does so by extending the author-
ity of the act and also providing for the
purchase of synthetic fuels and syn-
thetic chemical feed stock and for other
purposes. An examination of the other
purposes reveals nothing akin to the
amendment before us. The amendment
before us in effect seeks to apply the
National Environmental and Policy Act
8936
AMENDMENTS AND THE GERMANENESS RULE
Ch. 28 § 35
to finance synthetic fuel or feedstock
facility construction. The amendment
of the gentleman from Arizona estab-
lishes a complex mechanism for expe-
diting procedures for projects financed
by loan guarantees under the bill.
The Chair is unable in response to
the gentleman from Maryland to find
any respect in which the amendment
of the gentleman from Arizona would
amend the National Environmental
Protection Act, but merely provides
that determinations made as to pri-
ority of synthetic projects eligible for
expeditious review shall not be consid-
ered major Federal actions under that
law.
In the opinion of the Chair, the total-
ity of the Udall amendment constitutes
essentially an expediting of procedures
under authorities provided for in the
bill and is, therefore, germane.
The Chair overrules the point of
order.
Specific Project Deemed To
Satisfy Requirements of Law
Being Amended
of 1969, specifically on page 5 in sub-
paragraph (d) to the facilities that
would contract with the Government.
It appears to me that by attempting
to do this, this is beyond the scope of
the jurisdiction of this committee. It is
within the scope of other committees’
jurisdictions and certainly beyond the
scope of the bill, which simply deals
with contracts and purchases and not
the environmental qualities or activi-
ties of the people who seek to contract
with the Government.
Therefore, the amendment is not
germane and beyond the scope of the
bill. . . .
MR. [MORRIS K.] UDALL [of Arizona]:
. . . The pending bill creates authority
to finance directly and indirectly syn-
thetic fuel and chemical feed stocks,
feedstock projects. . . .
What my amendment does is not to
change any of the existing laws. It does
not change any environmental protec-
tion laws or anything else, but it says
we are going to have decisions. Within
nine months after this is put on the
fast track, we are going to get a yes or
no decision on it. . . .
This 
amendment 
simply 
supple-
ments the existing statutory proce-
dures to achieve expedited approval or
disapproval of various authorities nec-
essary for the completion of synfuel
projects created under the authority of
the legislation; so the subject matter of
the amendment is germane to the sub-
ject of the pending legislation. The
point of order ought to be rejected, Mr.
Chairman.

pared to rule.

On Oct. 14, 1978,(16) during con-
sideration of H.R. 14014 in the
Committee of the Whole, the
Chair overruled a point of order
against the following amendment:
Amendment offered by Mr. Ron-
calio: On page 32, after line 21, add
new section (No. 12) as follows:
‘‘The Department of the Army Per-
mit to Basin Electric Power Coopera-
tive for the Missouri Basin Power
Project, issued on March 23, 1978, as
amended October 10, 1978, is hereby
deemed to satisfy the requirements
of the Endangered Species Act (16
U.S.C. 1531 et seq.). . . .
MR. [FRANK
E.] EVANS
of Colo-
rado: . . . I think the amendment now
pending offered by the gentleman from
Wyoming is clearly in order. The sim-
ple thing this amendment does is de-
clare a legislative funding of fact rel-
ative to the Endangered Species Act.
Thus it is clearly germane.
THE
CHAIRMAN: (17)
The Chair is
ready to rule. This occupant of the
Chair had, as indicated, to make a
rather rapid analysis of the previous
amendment, not having been aware of
the questions at issue. The present
amendment offered by the gentleman
from Wyoming would appear, based on
the information that the Chair has
available and on the precedents avail-
able to him including the precedent
cited by the gentleman from Wyoming,
to be germane and completely in the
proper form, and therefore overrules
the point of order in connection with
the amendment of the gentleman from
Wyoming.

Reports—Amend-
ment To Require Statements

MR. [JOHN J.] CAVANAUGH [of Ne-
braska]: Mr. Chairman, I make a point
of order against the amendment. The
amendment is not germane to the sec-
tion of the bill to which it is offered,
and in addition it imposes duties upon
the Secretary of Commerce that are
nowhere else mentioned in the bill.
MR. [MARK] ANDREWS of North Da-
kota: . . . If a project of this type is
stopped because of an interpretation of
an act of the Congress, how then can
the rules of the Congress prohibit the
same Congress from amending the ac-
tion so that it does not affect a certain
type of project? This is basically what
the argument is all about. And to tie
up projects which would prevent the
homeowners from getting their elec-
tricity at a sensible cost because of the
interpretation of the law—if it cannot
be fixed in this body where can it be
fixed? . . .

amendment had been perfected by
amendment to eliminate a revi-
sion of Rule XVI which had pro-
posed changes in Committee of

a point of order, the amendment
in the nature of a substitute was
held not to be sufficiently broad in

MR. [NEAL] SMITH
of Iowa: Mr.
Chairman, I make a point of order
against the amendment for the reason
that it is an amendment to rule VIII,
whereas the principal resolution under
consideration here, House Resolution
988, attempts to amend rules X and XI
only. Therefore, the amendment is not
germane. . . .
MR. 
BINGHAM: 
. . . 
This 
would
amend title II of the resolution, which
is headed, ‘‘Miscellaneous and Con-
forming Provisions.’’ That title of the
resolution is not limited to changes in
rules X and XI. It affects other rules,
section 207, for example, amendment
to rule XVI, and under the heading of
‘‘Miscellaneous and Conforming Provi-
sions,’’ it would seem to me that a sim-
ple amendment to rule VIII would
clearly be in order.
THE
CHAIRMAN: (19)
The Chair is
ready to rule.
On hearing the gentleman from Iowa
(Mr. Smith) and the gentleman from
New York (Mr. Bingham), the Chair is
of the opinion that there is nothing in
the Hansen amendment in the nature
of a substitute, as perfected, relating to

held to be not germane.
On Mar. 7, 1973,(20) during con-
sideration of a resolution amend-
ing several clauses of a rule of the
House but confined in its scope to
the issue of access to committee
meetings and hearings, an amend-
ment to another clause of that
rule relating to committee staffing
was held to be not germane. The
proceedings were as follows:
MR. [JOHN B.] ANDERSON of Illinois:
Mr. Chairman, I offer an amendment.
The Clerk read as follows:
MR. [JOHN
J.] MCFALL
[of Cali-
fornia]: Mr. Chairman, I make a point
of order against the amendment on the
ground that it is not germane to the
matter that we are considering. The
matter that we are considering has to
do with access to committee meetings,
and the amendment has to do with
staff make-ups, and they are entirely
two different subject matters. . . .
MR. ANDERSON of Illinois: Mr. Chair-
man, House Resolution 259, the resolu-
tion we are considering today amends
two clauses in rule XI of the Rules of
the House of Representatives. I am
proposing another amendment to rule
XI namely the provision dealing with
minority staffing of committees.
I contend this amendment is ger-
mane and in order. Having only Can-
non’s Procedure of the 87th Congress
available to me, I quote from page 201
of that volume dealing with germane-
ness:
But where the bill proposes to
amend existing law in several par-
ticulars, no arbitrary rule can be laid
down either admitting or excluding
further amendments to the law not
proposed in the pending bill, but the
question of the germaneness of such
additional amendments must be de-
termined in each instance on the
merits of the case presented (VIII,
2938).
Amendment offered by Mr. Ander-
son of Illinois: On page 2, line 24,
add a new section 4, to read as fol-
lows:
Clause 32(c) of rule XI of the Rules
of the House of Representatives is
amended to read as follows:
‘‘(c) The minority party on any
such standing committee is entitled,
upon request of a majority of such
minority, to up to one-third of the
funds provided for the appointment
of committee staff pursuant to each
primary or additional expense reso-
lution. The committee shall appoint
any persons so selected whose char-
acter and qualifications are accept-
able to a majority of the committee.
If the committee determines that the
character and qualifications of any
person so selected are unacceptable
to the committee, a majority of the
minority party members may select
other persons for appointment by the
20. 119 CONG. REC. 6714, 93d Cong. 1st
Sess.
This ruling was made by Chairman
Sydney Anderson of Minnesota on
June 10, 1921. I quote from volume
VIII of the Precedents:
8941
DESCHLER-BROWN PRECEDENTS
Ch. 28 § 35
does not necessarily open the whole
law to amendment. The purpose and
scope of the bill must be considered. In
the 89th Congress, the Committee of
the Whole had under consideration a
bill amending the National Labor Rela-
tions Act to repeal section 14(b) of that
law. On that occasion, in several rul-
ings by Chairman O’Brien of New
York, the principal was reiterated that
where a bill is amendatory of existing
law in several particulars, but relates
to a single subject affected thereby,
amendments proposing to modify the
law but not related to the bill are not
germane (July 28, 1965, Rec. p. 18631–
18645).
For this reason, the Chair holds that
the amendment is not germane and
sustains the point of order.
The Chair does not think that the
general rule can be laid down that
where several portions of a law are
amended by a bill reported by a com-
mittee, it is not in any case in order
to amend another section of the bill
not included in the bill reported by
the committee, nor does the Chair
think that the opposite rule can be
laid down and rigidly applied in
every instance. The Chair thinks
that a question of this kind must be
determined in every instance in the
light of the facts which are presented
in the case. In the particular case
under consideration it appears that
the committee has reported a bill
which amends several sections of
Title IV of the bill in various particu-
lars. The Chair does not feel that he
can hold that no amendment to a
section not dealt with by the com-
mittee is not in order.
Law 
Amended 
in 
Two 
Re-
spects—Amendment To Add
Postal Service Property to
Definition of Federal Prop-
erty in Assessing ‘‘Impact’’
Mr. Chairman, I feel my amendment
would clearly be in order.
Mr. Chairman, the substitute rule
would not make it possible for any
other amendments to be made to rule
XI.
It seems to me this further argues in
favor of the germaneness of this par-
ticular amendment. I ask that the
point of order be overruled.
THE CHAIRMAN: (1) The Chair is pre-
pared to rule.
House Resolution 259, while it tech-
nically amends two different clauses of
rule XI, relates solely to the single sub-
ject of public access to House com-
mittee meetings and hearings. Thus,
amendments to other portions of rule
XI pertaining to committee jurisdiction
such as staffing, and procedures other
than access to hearings and meetings
would not be germane.

bill amends several sections of a law

held germane (but was ruled
out as in violation of Rule
XXI, clause 5, since permit-
ting a new use of funds al-
ready appropriated).
During consideration of H.R.
12835 (2) in the Committee of the
Whole on May 11, 1976,(3) the
Chair sustained a point of order
against an amendment, as de-
scribed above.
The Clerk read as follows:
titled to a payment under section 2
an amount equal to 100 per centum
of the amount to which it is entitled
as computed under that section for
such fiscal year and he shall further
allocate to each local educational
agency which is entitled to a pay-
ment under section 3 an amount
equal to 25 per centum of the
amount to which it is entitled as
computed under section 3(d) for such
fiscal year.’’.
(2) Section 5(c)(2) of such Act, as
so amended, is amended (A) by strik-
ing out ‘‘; and’’ at the end of clause
(F) and substituting a period, and
(B) by striking out clause (G). . . .
MR. [WILLIAM D.] FORD of Michigan:

94th Cong. 2d Sess.
MR. [ALBERT
H.] QUIE
[of Min-
nesota]: Mr. Chairman, I make a point
of order against the amendment of-
fered by the gentleman from Michigan
(Mr. Ford) on the grounds that it is not
germane to the bill under consider-
ation.
The gentleman’s amendment seeks
to amend the definitions title of impact
aid, Public Law 874 of the 81st Con-
gress. The bill before us contains only
two technical amendments to impact
aid. The amendment offered by the
8943
DESCHLER-BROWN PRECEDENTS
Ch. 28 § 35
gentleman from Michigan seeks to
make a major change in the impact aid
law by substantially increasing pay-
ments under the program. The gen-
tleman seeks to include his amend-
ment in title III, which relates to tech-
nical and miscellaneous amendments.
Clearly, the amendment offered by the
gentleman is not technical and is sub-
stantial in nature.
It is my view that the amendment is
in violation of clause 7 of rule XVI of
the Rules of the House of Representa-
tives. I cite as precedent for my posi-
tion the ruling of the Chair on Novem-
ber 29, 1971, when the Chair ruled
that an amendment to regulate a
broad scope of activities is not germane
to a proposition imposing restrictions
within a limited area of activities.
I would also cite as a precedent the
ruling of the Chair on April 28, 1971,
to the effect that an amendment pro-
posing changes in another section of a
law is not germane to a bill amending
one section of existing law to accom-
plish a particular purpose. . . .
The amendment is also in violation
of clause 5 of rule XXI, relating to ap-
propriations since the amendment is
effective immediately and thereby af-
fects already appropriated funds. . . .
THE CHAIRMAN: (4) The Chair is pre-
pared to rule.
In connection with the point of order
the gentleman from Minnesota makes
regarding the question of germaneness,
the Chair has examined the amend-
ment and the legislation to which the
amendment is offered. Upon an exam-
ination of title III, which is a very di-
verse title and is open to amendment
at any point, that title actually amends
4. B. F. Sisk (Calif.).
Public Law 81–874 in two diverse re-
spects, as indicated on pages 214 to
217 of the Ramseyer rule in the com-
mittee report, section 403 of that act is
amended in the bill on page 186. This
amendment would make a further
change in that section of the law.
Therefore, on the basis of germane-
ness, it is the opinion of the Chair that
the amendment is germane; however,
with respect to the point of order that
the amendment violates clause 5, rule
XXI, it appears to the Chair, recalling
the debate on the rule of yesterday
where points of order were waived
against the committee amendment,
that there are in existence appro-
priated funds for impact aid purposes
which this amendment would permit to
be used for a new category of recipi-
ents. Since the amendment permits a
new use of funds already appropriated,
the Chair would have to hold that that
amendment is a violation of clause 5,
rule XXI and, therefore, would sustain
that portion of the point of order.
Now, the Chair would state, of
course, that we are dealing here with a
point of order dealing exclusively with
the reuse of funds already appro-
priated.
Therefore, the Chair sustains the
point of order in connection with clause
5 of rule XXI.
Parliamentarian’s Note: While
the bill was primarily a vocational
Education Act amendment and ex-
tension, title III amended mis-
cellaneous education laws, includ-
ing diverse laws on elementary
and 
secondary 
education, 
and
thus greatly broadened the scope
of the bill.

Sec. 2. Section 2401(b) of title 39,
United States Code, is amended to
read as follows:
‘‘(b)(1) There is authorized to be
appropriated to the Postal Service
for the fiscal year ending June 30,
1976, and for each of the fiscal years
ending September 30, 1977, 1978,
and 1979, an amount equal to $35
multiplied by the number of delivery
addresses estimated by the Postal
Service to be served during the fiscal
year involved. There is authorized to
be appropriated to the Postal Service
for the period commencing July 1,
1976, and ending September 30,
1976, an amount equal to one-fourth
the amount authorized under this
subsection for the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1976. . . .

its relationship to the pending

MR. [BILL] ALEXANDER [of Arkansas]:
Mr. Chairman, I offer a perfecting
amendment.
The Clerk read as follows:
Amendment offered by Mr. Alex-
ander: Page 12, strike out line 20
and all that follows through page 13,
line 6, and insert in lieu thereof the
following:
Sec. 2. (a)(1) Section 2401(a) of
title 39, United States Code, is
amended to read as follows:
‘‘(a)(1) There are authorized to be
appropriated to the Postal Service
for the fiscal year ending June 30,
1976, such sums as may be nec-
essary to enable the Postal Service
to carry out the purposes, functions,
and powers authorized by this title.
. . .
(b) Section 2401(b) of title 39,
United States Code, is amended to
read as follows:
‘‘(b)(1) There are authorized to be
appropriated to the Postal Service
such sums as may be necessary as
reimbursement to the Postal Service
for public service costs incurred by it
in providing a maximum degree of
effective and regular postal service
nationwide, in communities where
post offices may not be deemed self-
sustaining, as elsewhere.’’. . .
MR. HANLEY: Mr. Chairman, I raise
[a] point of order on the grounds that
the matter contained in the amend-
ment is in violation of clause 7, rule
XVI of the rules of the House, which
provides in part that—
No motion or proposition on a sub-
ject different from that under consid-
eration shall be admitted under color
of amendment.
The bill under consideration, H.R.
8603, is narrow in scope since it re-
lates only to the following specific sub-
ject matters.
First, it provides authorization for
increased public service appropriations
by changing the statutory formula cur-
rently in existence.
Second, it would limit the amount of
the next temporary rate increase and
would establish new procedures and
limitations for the implementation of
other future temporary postal rates.
Third, it would amend the law with
respect to the Postal Rate Commission
by changing its procedures to expedite
rate and classification cases; by sub-
jecting the Commissioners to Senate
confirmation; and by expanding the
powers of the Chairman in admin-
istering the Commission. . . .
THE CHAIRMAN: The Chair is pre-
pared to rule.
The gentleman from New York (Mr.
Hanley) has made a point of order to
the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from Arkansas (Mr. Alexander)
to section 2 of the bill. The gentleman’s
point of order relates, in the Chair’s
judgment, primarily to the germane-
ness based upon the scope of the gen-
tleman’s amendment and as it relates
to the scope of the bill, which bill is
open to amendment at any point.
The amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from Arkansas (Mr. Alexander)
actually amends section 2(a) of the bill,
although section 2(a) of the Postal Act
is not amended in the bill before the
Committee here this afternoon.
The Chair notes, however, as con-
ceded by the chairman of the sub-
committee, there are several enumer-
ated purposes which touch upon many
different ramifications and aspects of
the postal law. These purposes are di-
verse in nature.
Since all of the bill is before the
Committee at this point, the Chair re-

amended, as precedes the second
paragraph thereof is hereby amend-
ed to read as follows:
luctantly comes to the conclusion that
the position of the gentleman from
New York (Mr. Hanley) in his point of
order is not well founded and, there-
fore, the Chair must overrule the point
of order made by the gentleman from
New York.

A point of order was raised
against the amendment, as fol-
lows:
MR. [THOMAS J.] MURRAY [of Ten-
nessee]: Mr. Chairman, I make the
point of order that the amendment of-
fered by the gentleman from New York
is not germane to the pending bill. It
does not pertain to any provision of the
bill now under consideration which re-
lates only to salary and to reassign-
ment of the first three grades of Public
Law 134.
The Chairman,(9) in ruling on
the point of order, stated:
§ 35.94 To a bill relating to the
number of grades and posi-
tions in the postal field serv-
ice and providing salary in-
creases for personnel in such
service, an amendment relat-
ing to annual and sick leave
of such personnel was held
to be not germane.
In the 82d Congress, a bill (7)
was under consideration which
sought to amend the act of July 6,
1945, as amended, so as to reduce
the number of grades for the var-
ious positions under such act. The
following amendment was offered
to the bill: (8)
Amendment offered by Mr. [Victor
L.] Anfuso [of New York]:
Page 10, after line 10, insert the fol-
lowing:
As the Chair stated before, this bill
provides for the number of grades and
positions in the postal field service and
also provides salary increases for per-
sonnel in such service.
The amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from New York deals neither
with the number of grades or positions
in the postal service nor with salary
increases as such. It concerns an en-
tirely different matter, namely, annual
and sick leave.

Be it enacted by the Senate and

of 
Representatives 
of

United States of America in Congress
assembled, That (a) chapter 71 of
title 5, United States Code, is
amended by adding at the end there-
of the following new subchapter:
‘‘SUBCHAPTER III—EMPLOYEE
RIGHTS
‘‘§ 7171. Right to representation dur-
ing questioning
‘‘(a) Any employee of an Executive
agency under investigation for mis-
conduct which could lead to suspen-
sion, removal, or reduction in rank
or pay of such employee shall not be
required to answer questions relat-
ing to the misconduct under inves-
tigation unless—
‘‘(1) the employee is advised in
writing of—
‘‘(A) the fact that such employee is
under investigation for misconduct,

lowed to have such representative

he so elects. . . .
§ 35.95 Unless a bill so exten-
sively amends existing law as
to open up the entire law to

the 
germane-
ness of an amendment to the
bill depends upon its rela-
tionship to the subject of the

amending a section of title 5,

certain rights to employees
of executive agencies of the

government, 
an
amendment extending those
rights to legislative branch
employees, as defined in a
different section of that title,

word
‘‘agency’’ the following: ‘‘, or any em-
ployee as defined under section 2107
of this Title.’’.
MR. CHARLES H. WILSON of Cali-
fornia: Madam Chairman, I have a
point of order against the amendment.
. . .
Madam Chairman, under rule XVI,
clause 7, of the Rules of the House,
any amendment to a bill concerning a
subject different from those contained
in the bill is not germane and is sub-
ject to a point of order. The instant
amendment proposes to make the bill
applicable to a completely new class of
employees other than what is covered
under the bill, namely, congressional
employees. However, the reported bill
applies only to employees of executive
agencies as defined under section 105.
In my opinion, the subject of the
amendment is not similar to any of the
subject matters involved in H.R. 6227
which I have just outlined and is not
germane. . . .
MR. 
BEARD
of 
Tennessee: 
. . .
Madam Chairman, I feel the amend-
ment is germane to this particular bill
inasmuch as the people we are includ-
ing in this bill are Federal employees
and those concerning whom we are leg-
islating today are Federal employees.
. . .
Madam Chairman, if I may be heard
further on the point of order, all this
does is to remove an exemption rather
than add a group of employees. It is
just removing an exemption, and I be-
lieve that is the fair thing to do.
THE CHAIRMAN: (12) The Chair is pre-
pared to rule.
The bill before us is very explicit as
to its scope. It includes any employee
of an executive agency. The bill itself,
by its own terms, affects the class of
civil servants known as executive
agency employees.
The amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from Tennessee (Mr. Beard)
would seek to amend the bill by adding
a totally different individual class of
employees to the bill beyond the scope
of the bill, namely, congressional em-
ployees as defined in section 2107.
The rule of germaneness, in terms of
amendments of this kind, states as fol-
lows: One individual proposition may
not be amended by another individual
proposition, even though the two be-
long to the same class.
In light of that principle and in light
of the scope of this bill, the Chair rules
that this amendment is not germane
and is, therefore, out of order. . . .
MR. [JOHN H.] ROUSSELOT [of Cali-
fornia]: Madam Chairman, respecting
the chairperson’s ruling, in regard to
title V to which this bill addresses
itself, an amendment to title V in-
cludes all employees, including the
President, Members of Congress, and
members of the uniformed services,
even though this bill has application,
as the gentlewoman has said, only to
Federal employees. Therefore, this title
V does apply to all Federal employees.
. . .
THE CHAIRMAN: To the gentleman
from California (Mr. Rousselot) the
Chair would only state that the ger-
maneness of the amendment must be
weighed against the content and scope
of the bill and not title V of the United
States Code, as the gentleman would
interpret it.

MR. [LINDSAY C.] WARREN [of North

the Chairman, stated: (16)
§ 35.96 To a bill proposing to
amend an act in several par-
ticulars an amendment pro-
posing to modify the act but
not related to the bill is not
germane.
In the 76th Congress, a bill (13)

under 
consideration 
pro-

pro-
ceedings took place on Apr. 11,

THE CHAIRMAN: (15) . . . The Clerk
will read.
The Clerk read as follows:
There is no question that the amend-
ment would have been germane to the
act of 1929. The precedents, however,
seem to be very definite on the propo-
sition that when a bill proposes to
amend an act in several particulars an
amendment proposing to modify the
act but not related to the bill is not
germane. . . .
The pending section of the bill does
not in any way affect the total number
of Members of the House but only pro-
poses to change the time when the
statement of the President must be
transmitted to Congress. The Chair is
of the opinion therefore that the
amendment is not germane and sus-
tains the point of order.
That an act to provide for the fif-
teenth and subsequent decennial
censuses and to provide for appor-
tionment of Representatives in Con-
gress, approved June 18, 1929, is
hereby amended in the first sentence

There was no objection.
The Clerk read as follows:
MR. [CHARLES
C.] DIGGS
[Jr., of
Michigan]: Mr. Chairman, I make a
point of order against the amendment
on the ground that it is nongermane.
The purpose of H.R. 15888 is to accom-
plish several specific goals, including
the development of low- and moderate-
income housing, increase employment
opportunities for District residents,
and the development of substandard
and blighted residential, commercial,
and industrial areas in our National
Capital in time for our Nation’s Bicen-
tennial. Clearly, the powers conferred
on the proposed Corporation are spe-
cifically subject to the limited and cir-
cumscribed purpose in the provisions
of the bill. Accordingly, we must read
the powers of the bill contained in sec-
tion 201 in the context of the purposes
and findings contained in section 102.
Nowhere do we find a statement that
the Corporation may engage in estab-
lishing parking facilities or the regula-
tion thereof. To argue that the powers
are so broad as to allow an amendment
which purpose is to restrict the overall
powers of the Council is, in my view,
outside of the purposes of H.R. 15888
and therefore nongermane. . . .
Any amendment which seeks to deal
with Council authority over parking in
areas under the control of the United
States or the District of Columbia gov-
ernment, which would include the
streets of the District, clearly goes be-
yond the limited powers granted the
Corporation under this act. Accord-
ingly, it would be nongermane. . . .
MR. PARRIS: . . . Section 313 of H.R.
15888, as amended by my colleague,
Mr. Fauntroy, providing for a sub-
section b to section 313, directly and
expressly limits and thereby amends

ernmental Reorganization Act, shall
have no authority to adopt any rule
or regulation with respect to the uti-
lization of parking facilities (includ-
ing on-street and off-street parking)
within the District of Columbia
which is more restrictive upon non-
residents of the District of Columbia
than residents of the District of Co-

sion of the District of Columbia Self-

District of Columbia shall have no

AMENDMENTS AND THE GERMANENESS RULE
Ch. 28 § 35
ment and Governmental Reorganiza-
tion Act, as it relates to provisions of
H.R. 15888.
My amendment does no more and
goes no further than does the amend-
ment submitted by Mr. Fauntroy.
With respect to the developmental
powers that may be exercised by the
District of Columbia Community De-
velopment and Finance Corporation
and according to the provisions of the
act and as stated in the report on page
7, that corporation which is an instru-
mentality of the District government
may:
18. Construct, manage or operate
public facilities for the District gov-
ernment or any other public body, at
its request.
As I read this and as any responsible
man would read this, the District gov-
ernment, if it wishes, could by enact-
ment or regulation permit this instru-
mentality of the District of Columbia,
the District of Columbia Development
and Finance Corporation, to manage
and operate parking facilities in the
District of Columbia, be they on public
property such as those where meters
now exist or other public property in
residential areas where a ban on non-
residential parking could be imposed.
Item 17 on page 7 of the report indi-
cated that the corporation may:
Manage its own property, or to
enter into agreement with the Dis-
trict of Columbia government or a
private entity for the management of
property.
Here again, this would certainly per-
mit this corporation to engage in the
management of on-street parking in
the District of Columbia in either com-
mercial or residential areas at the di-
rection and discretion of the District of
Columbia government and this cor-
poration which is its instrumentality.
. . .
Mr. Chairman, I submit that title II
of H.R. 15888 is so broad and so gen-
eral that it permits this corporation,
which it establishes, to perform nearly
any function that the District of Co-
lumbia government itself could per-
form, because by and large such pow-
ers and authority could be delegated to
it if, in fact, title II of the bill does not
directly and expressly give those pow-
ers to that corporation. . . .
THE CHAIRMAN: The gentleman from
Michigan makes a point of order
against the amendment offered by the
gentleman from Virginia.
The amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from Virginia directly limits
the powers of the present District of
Columbia Council, and of the Council
to be established under the Home Rule
Act, to regulate all parking facilities
within the District of Columbia. The
bill H.R. 15888, which the gentleman’s
amendment seeks to amend, estab-
lishes a Community Development and
Finance Corporation and gives such
corporation certain powers. It does not
appear to the Chair that the scope of
the bill extends to regulation, either by
the Corporation or by the City Council,
of all parking within the District of Co-
lumbia.
The amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from Virginia does not even
mention the powers of the Corporation
which is the primary subject of H.R.
15888, but limits instead the powers of
the City Council. While a narrowly
drawn amendment limiting the power
of the Corporation to institute parking

The gentleman from Virginia has ar-
gued that the amendment already in-
corporated into the bill is similar to his
amendment, and that his amendment
no more limits the powers of the Coun-
cil or amends the Home Rule Act than
does the adopted amendment. The new
section 303, added by amendment of
the gentleman from the District of Co-
lumbia, only limits the powers of the
Council as to the requirement that
projects which the Corporation is au-
thorized to undertake be submitted for
approval to congressional committees.
The new section 303 directly relates to
the financing of projects authorized in
the bill, and the section further states
that the Council may not change the
requirement of submission for congres-
sional approval. It does not appear to
the Chair that that provision in any
way amends the powers of the Council
under the Home Rule Act or that it
touches on any subject not in the bill
H.R. 15888.
Section 313, added by committee
amendment to specify that the bill
does not preempt the legislative au-
thority conferred on the City Council
under the Home Rule Act, does not
bring the subject of the general powers
of the City Council under the Home
Rule Act within the purview of the bill,
except to the extent that the Council
may or may not control the activities of
the Corporation.
For the reasons stated, the Chair
sustains the point of order.
§ 35.99 To a bill which sought,
as part of a comprehensive
scheme for the regulation of
8954
AMENDMENTS AND THE GERMANENESS RULE
Ch. 28 § 35
transfers of firearms, to ex-
tend the provisions of exist-
ing law governing handguns
to transactions involving ri-
fles and shotguns and to
specify regulations for the
identification of firearms by
importers and manufactur-
ers, an amendment requiring
registration of firearms by
the purchasers thereof was
held to be an extension of
matter already carried in the
bill and therefore germane.
In the 90th Congress, during
consideration of the State Fire-
arms Control Assistance Act of
1968,(19) an amendment was of-
fered which stated in part: (20)
MR. [JOHN D.] DINGELL [of Michi-
gan]: Mr. Chairman, the fundamental
purpose of the amendment must be
germane to the bill. Here the amend-
ment goes far beyond the purposes of
the bill and imposes a whole new se-
ries of responsibilities on the Sec-
retary, including registration of fire-
arms. . . .
I submit, in conclusion, the [amend-
ment] offered by my friend goes far be-
yond the matter before the House,
compels entirely new duties and re-
sponsibilities, adds entirely new class-
es of persons, creates entirely new reg-
ulatory problems, and, indeed, ad-
vances and enhances in enormous
manner the scope of the bill, far be-
yond that which was submitted to this
body and far beyond that which was
contemplated by the committee.
The Chairman,(2) in ruling on
the point of order, stated: (3)
Amendment offered by Mr. [Robert]
McClory [of Illinois]: . . . On page 32,
after line 11, insert the following:
CHAPTER 44A—REGISTRATION OF
HANDGUNS

932. Registration . . .
§932. Registration.—(a) It is un-
lawful for a person knowingly to pos-
sess a firearm not registered in ac-
cordance with the provisions of this
section. . . .
A point of order was raised
against the amendment, as fol-
lows: (1)
. . . [T]he bill which the Committee
of the Whole is now considering seeks
to regulate the various transactions in-
volving rifles, shotguns, and handguns.
It provides for the identification of
such firearms by manufacturers and
importers and, as amended by the
Committee on the Judiciary and by
this committee earlier this afternoon,
specifies that this identification shall
include serial numbers. Licensed im-
porters, dealers, and manufacturers
are required to retain descriptions of
the firearms with which they deal.
The amendment proposed by the
gentleman from Illinois [Mr. McClory]
is drafted as a further amendment to

dividuals, clubs or organiza-
tions was held to be ger-
mane.
In the 90th Congress, a bill (4)
was under consideration relating
to military procurement author-
ization for fiscal 1969. The bill
stated in part as follows: (5)
TITLE II—RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT,
TEST, AND EVALUATION
Sec. 201. Funds are hereby author-
ized to be appropriated during the fis-
cal year 1969 for the use of the Armed
Forces of the United States for re-
search, development, test, and evalua-
tion, as authorized by law in amounts
as follows:
For the Army, $1,641,900,000. . . .
TITLE IV—GENERAL PROVISIONS
title 18, United States Code, the same
portion of the Code amended by the
pending bill. It carries the concept of
registration or identification to the per-
sons having handguns in their posses-
sion. The system of registration estab-
lished by the amendment would be
under the jurisdiction of the Secretary
of the Treasury, the same officer des-
ignated for this purpose by the bill.
The Chair notes that the bill makes
at least three major innovations in the
existing law concerning gun control: it
extends that law with respect to trans-
actions in rifles and shotguns; it brings
ammunition within the scheme of the
law; and it modifies the law regarding
shipment and sale of destructive de-
vices. Since present law is modified in
the foregoing ways, an additional
change in the law and the bill—a
change that is an extension of a sub-
ject already carried in the bill—is ger-
mane.
The Chair therefore overrules the
point of order.
Sec. 404. (a) Chapter 163 of title 10,
United States Code, is amended by
adding at the end thereof the following
new section:
Disposal of Surplus Military
Equipment—Amendment Pro-
hibiting Transfer of Surplus

tary equipment: sale to State, local

for is made by such agency, in such
form and manner as the Secretary of
Defense shall prescribe. . . . Such
equipment may not be sold, or other-
wise transferred, by such agency to
any individual or public or private
organization or agency.
The following amendment was
offered to the bill: (6)
Amendment offered by Mr. [Sidney
R.] Yates [of Illinois]: On page 11, line
17, strike out the period and substitute
a comma and insert the following:
‘‘Provided, however, That no surplus or
obsolete military guns or ammunition
shall be sold or loaned or otherwise
transferred to any private individual,
association, board, club, or organiza-
tion.’’
A point of order was raised
against the amendment, as fol-
lows:
§ 35.101 To a bill amending a
title of the United States
Code to provide penalties for
travel in or use of interstate
facilities with intent to incite
a riot, an amendment which
sought to control and regu-
late the shipment of firearms
in interstate commerce was
held to be not germane.
In the 90th Congress, during
consideration of a bill (8) amending
Title 18 of the United States Code
and making it a crime to travel in
or use interstate facilities with
the intent to incite a riot, an
amendment was offered which
sought to add to Title 18 a com-
prehensive gun control law and to
repeal the Federal Firearms Act,
found in Title 15.(9) Mr. Edwin E.
Willis, of Louisiana, reserved a
point of order against the amend-
ment.(10) The following exchange
ensued:
MR. [DURWARD G.] HALL [of Mis-
souri]: . . . [T]he amendment is out of
order because this is an amendment
pertaining to the domestic distribution
of firearms and firefighting equipment.
It is not consistent with the essence of
the bill as prescribed under section
2576 and the actions of the Secretary
of Defense.
The Chairman,(7) in ruling on
the point of order, stated:
MR. [HAROLD R.] GROSS [of Iowa]:
Mr. Chairman, I make the point of
order against the amendment on the
grounds that the amendment is not
germane to the pending legislation.
The whole section . . . deals with
obsolete and surplus military equip-
ment. This is a further limitation on
that. The Chair overrules the point of
order.

Ch. 28 § 35
MR. WILLIS: That is the reservation
that I had in mind.
MR. GROSS: I have no reservation, I
am making the point of order.
MR. WILLIS: All right.
The proponent of the amend-
ment, Mr. Richard D. McCarthy,
of New York, stated in response to
the point of order:
MR. [ANDREW] JACOBS [Jr., of Indi-
ana]: . . . If a rifle, which is an inte-
gral part of effective and deadly riot, is
shipped in interstate commerce, it
seems to me that it does relate to a fa-
cility in interstate or foreign com-
merce, the shipment of which is with
the intent to incite a riot or other vio-
lent disturbance, and that therefore
the amendment . . . is germane. . . .
MR. [THOMAS S.] FOLEY [of Wash-
ington]: . . . [T]he use of ‘‘facility’’ in
the bill before the committee is de-
signed to mean a facility of transpor-
tation or communication and not a fa-
cility such as an instrument of fire-
arms. . . .
The Chairman, in ruling on the
point of order, stated:
Mr. Chairman, this amendment is
germane because the pattern of these
riots is clear. Guerrilla warfare in the
streets with snipers pouring deadly
gunfire from roofs. . . .
After some further remarks,
and in response to objections of
Mr. Gross, the Chairman (11) made
the request that Mr. McCarthy
‘‘confine his remarks to the point
of order.’’
Speaking in support of the point
of order, Mr. Willis stated: (12)
The bill before the Committee is one
which proscribes travel by people
across State lines in furtherance of ri-
oting.
The amendment would add a new
chapter, chapter 102, to title 18 of the
Code under the subject of ‘‘Riots.’’ The
words ‘‘Chapter 102 of the Code’’ are
not even mentioned in this strange and
completely 
disassociated 
amend-
ment. . . .
The 
following 
exchange, 
di-
rected to the point of order, con-
cerned the meaning of the terms
of the bill:
11. Joseph L. Evins (Tenn.).
12. 113 CONG. REC. 19413, 90th Cong.
1st Sess., July 19, 1967.
The committee has before it H.R.
421, a bill which adds a new chapter
entitled ‘‘Riots’’ to title 18, United
States Code, and it makes certain ac-
tivities in interstate commerce unlaw-
ful, and specific penalties are provided.
The amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from New York [Mr. McCarthy]
makes unlawful certain actions and
deals in sale and transportation in
interstate and foreign commerce of
firearms or ammunition. The amend-
ment provides a comprehensive legisla-
tive scheme for control for interstate
shipment of firearms.
The Chair feels that the amendment
comes within the rule of germaneness,
wherein it is said that one individual
proposition may not be amended by an-
other 
individual 
proposition 
even
though the two belong to the same
class. . . .
. . . [T]he Chair feels that while

MR. [HENRY J.] HYDE [of Illinois]:
Mr. Chairman, I make a point of order
that the amendment violates clause 7
of rule XVI. . . . The proposed amend-
ment is not germane to the bill be-
cause it deals with matters beyond the
scope of the bill’s provisions and the
amendment includes matters within
the jurisdiction of committees of the
House not reporting the bill under con-
sideration.
Mr. Chairman, the amendment is
not germane, and consequently violates
clause 7 of rule XVI in the following
specific respects:
First, the bill authorizes funds for a
limited number of executive depart-
ments or their subcomponents speci-
fied in section 101 of the bill and
makes a few very modest changes in
the statutory authorities of only a few
of those agencies.
The amendment would enact a com-
prehensive scheme of oversight and re-
porting requirements for all U.S. intel-
ligence activities which are engaged in
by any U.S. Government agency, not
8962
AMENDMENTS AND THE GERMANENESS RULE
Ch. 28 § 35
just those covered by the bill, as well
as by third parties outside of the U.S.
Government. (Amndt: p. 4, lines 6–12.)
In this regard, I call attention to a
ruling by the Chair on September 27,
1967 (113 Cong. Rec. page 26957) cited
in section 798f of the Rules and Prac-
tice of the House of Representatives.
That ruling states that, ‘‘To a bill lim-
ited in its applicability to certain de-
partments and agencies of government,
an amendment applicable to all depart-
ments and agencies is not germane.’’
Second, the only provision of the bill
addressing congressional oversight of
intelligence is section 503. That provi-
sion is limited to oversight related only
to one specific and narrow class of in-
telligence activities, and that is com-
mercial cover activities to provide secu-
rity only for intelligence collection.
Moreover, section 503 of the bill ap-
plies only to elements of one executive
department, the Defense Department,
and the provision expires at the end of
5 years.
The amendment goes far beyond that
one new and specifically limited over-
sight subject in the bill. The amend-
ment provides for a comprehensive
oversight system for intelligence activi-
ties of the U.S. Government in general,
and in some cases the role of outside
third parties. The amendment is also
not limited in duration, as is section
503 of the bill, but is broader because
it would enact a permanent statutory
change. In these regards, the amend-
ment is not germane because it is more
general in nature than the only provi-
sion of the bill which deals with one
particular and narrow class within the
general subject of intelligence over-
sight reporting.
The amendment further requires, as
part of its oversight scheme, that the
House and Senate establish certain
procedures by adopting internal rules
or resolutions, matters not dealt with
in any form by the bill. (Amndt: page
3, lines 4–18.)
Third, the amendment is not ger-
mane because its text consists entirely
of provisions repealing or amending
sections of two statutes not amended
or addressed by the bill under consid-
eration.
The amendment extensively amends
title V of the National Security Act of
1947, codified in title 50 of the United
States Code, and repeals section 662 of
the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961,
codified in title 22 of the United States
Code. The bill does not amend either of
those statutes, and indeed, does not
amend any part of title 22 of the
United States Code.
Section 799 of the Rules and Practice
of the House of Representatives cites a
ruling by the Chair on May 11, 1976,
that, ‘‘Generally to a bill amending one
existing law, an amendment changing
the provisions of another law . . . is
not germane.’’ Precedents cited in sec-
tions 33.1 and 33.3 of chapter 28 of
Procedures in the U.S. House of Rep-
resentatives, 97th Congress, 4th Edi-
tion (Deschler and Brown) support this
principle with which the proposed
amendment is inconsistent.
Furthermore, chapter 28, section
33.14 of Deschler and Brown’s Proce-
dures in the U.S. House of Representa-
tives, 97th Congress, 4th Edition cites
a precedent from a ruling of March 7,
1974 (120 Cong Rec. 5653, 5654, 93rd
Cong. 2nd Sess.) that, ‘‘An amendment
repealing existing law has been held
not germane to a bill not amending
that law.’’ In proposing to repeal a sec-
8963
DESCHLER-BROWN PRECEDENTS
Ch. 28 § 35
dealt with the imposition of criminal
penalties, a matter not dealt with in
the proposition being amended. Fur-
ther, the Chair ruled that the sub-
stitutes’ imposition of criminal pen-
alties was a matter outside the juris-
diction of the committee which had re-
ported the pending bill [Armed Serv-
ices] and, if offered as a separate bill,
would have to be referred to the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary.
For all the reasons given and in light
of the precedents cited, the amendment
is not germane, and therefore it vio-
lates clause 7 of rule XVI. I insist upon
my point of order, Mr. Chairman. . . .
MRS. BOXER: . . . We feel it is abso-
lutely germane. We feel that there are
other provisions in the bill, for example
on page 26 and page 33 that talk about
permanent changes in law, and we
would say that this is absolutely ger-
mane.
My goodness, we are talking about
covert activities, and certainly the In-
telligence Committee, and it is hard for
me to believe that someone could say
that a discussion of covert activities in
this particular amendment would not
be germane to the intelligence author-
ization bill. . . .
MR. [ANTHONY
C.] BEILENSON
[of
California]: . . . I recognize the right of
the gentleman, of course, to make this
point of order and, in fact, I do not
know how the Chair will rule on the
precedents which the gentleman from
Illinois has cited. I would only ask that
in its ruling the Chair consider the fact
that there are already provisions in the
bill which do broaden its scope. . . .
THE CHAIRMAN: (15) . . . The Chair is
prepared to rule.
tion of the Foreign Assistance Act of
1961, a statute not amended by the
bill, the proposed amendment is not
germane. (Amndt: page 1, lines 3–4.)
Fourth, the amendment is not ger-
mane because it fails the test of com-
mittee jurisdiction under section 798c
of the Rules and Practice of the House
of Representatives by including mat-
ters within the jurisdiction of commit-
tees not reporting the bill, the Com-
mittee on Foreign Affairs and Rules.
The amendment would repeal sec-
tion 662 of the Foreign Assistance Act
of 1961. That act is within the jurisdic-
tion of the Foreign Affairs Committee.
(Amndt: page 1, lines 3–4.)
The amendment also would require
the House (and one of its committees)
to establish certain internal procedures
by the adoption of House rules or reso-
lutions. Such matters are within the
jurisdiction of the Committee on Rules.
(Amndt: p. 3, lines 4–18.)
Fifth, the amendment (at p. 8, lines
8–12) would create a penal offense,
whereas the pending bill does not deal
with or create any criminal offenses. In
addition, the committees reporting the
bill do not have jurisdiction to consider
such matters. In that regard, I would
call the attention of the Chair to a
precedent of the House, rulings by the
Chairman of the Committee of the
Whole, Mr. Forand on April 7, 1960. In
those rulings, the Chair sustained
points of order against two amend-
ments to a pending amendment in the
nature of a substitute to a bill relating
to employment of retired officers by
Defense contractors reported from the
Armed 
Services 
Committee. 
Those
points of order were sustained by the
Chair, which ruled that the substitutes

AMENDMENTS AND THE GERMANENESS RULE
Ch. 28 § 35
The gentleman from Illinois (Mr.
Hyde) makes the point of order that
the amendment offered by the gentle-
woman from California is not germane
to the bill. The amendment adds a new
title and must be germane to the bill
as a whole, as amended.
The bill authorizes funding for the
intelligence community for 1 fiscal year
and makes several, diverse changes in
permanent law relating to sundry au-
thorities of the Central Intelligence
Agency and the Department of De-
fense. For example, the bill makes
changes in the CIA retirement and dis-
ability system; it authorizes the Sec-
retary of Defense to permit compo-
nents of DOD to charge the CIA the
same rate for airlift services that they
would charge another component of
DOD; and it authorizes the Secretary
of Defense to withhold certain geodetic
products from disclosure under the
Freedom of Information Act. In addi-
tion, the bill, as perfected, includes the
amendment recommended by the Com-
mittee on Armed Services directing the
Secretary of Defense to provide Mem-
bers of Congress access to a classified
report of the Defense Intelligence
Agency assessing efforts to account for
military personnel listed as prisoners
of war or missing in action.
The amendment at the desk does not
repeal the Hughes-Ryan law, but does
amend title V of the National Security
Act of 1947—relating to accountability
for intelligence activities. Among other
things, it assigns to the President sev-
eral responsibilities of the type that
the existing act assigns to lower offi-
cials, such as the Director of Central
Intelligence.
Although the bill does not amend the
National Security Act of 1947, neither
does it confine itself to authorities and
activities of the intelligence commu-
nity. In addition to the changes in per-
manent law already noted, at section
503 the bill inserts new provisions in
title 10 of the United States Code—re-
lating to the Armed Forces—to ensure
congressional oversight of activities of
the Department of Defense in commer-
cial cover of intelligence operations.
Thus, the subject matter of the
amendment—the relationship between
the executive branch and the Congress
with respect to the authorities and ac-
tivities of the intelligence community—
is one of the diverse topics already ad-
dressed in the bill.
Accordingly, the point of order is
overruled.
MR. HYDE: Mr. Chairman, may I ask
one question?
Mr. Chairman, I did not hear that
part, what the Chair read about the
criminal penalties that she inserts in
the law, and my point that that should
go to the Committee on the Judiciary,
that it is certainly beyond the scope of
our bill.
I must have missed that. How did
the Chair rule on that, sir?
THE CHAIRMAN: The Chair thinks
that the bill, as presented and amend-
ed contains provisions within several
committee jurisdictions. Therefore the
amendment need not meet a strict ju-
risdictional test. Accordingly, the Chair
rules that the point of order is over-
ruled.
Parliamentarian’s 
Note: 
Mr.
Hyde’s point of order anticipated
inclusion in the Boxer amendment
of a provision repealing the so-
called ‘‘Hughes-Ryan’’ amendment
8965
DESCHLER-BROWN PRECEDENTS
Ch. 28 § 35
The ruling described above was
made on July 6, 1939.(16)
Pro-
ceedings were as follows:
The Clerk called the bill (H.R. 6634)
amending previous flood-control acts
and authorizing certain preliminary
examinations and surveys for flood
control, and for other purposes.
There being no objection, the Clerk
read the bill as follows:
to the Foreign Assistance Act (22
U.S.C. 2422), a law not amended
by the bill and within the partial
jurisdiction of another committee
(Foreign 
Affairs). 
The 
offered
amendment did not include that
proposed repeal but did include
the criminal provision cited in the
point of order. As indicated in the
Chair’s follow-up response, it was
only because of the diverse nature
of the bill that the criminal provi-
sion was held germane. (Compare
Apr. 7, 1960, rulings in sections
4.39 and 4.40, supra, cited by Mr.
Hyde.) In those cases the points of
order were sustained that the
criminal sanction provisions con-
tained in the amendments at-
tempted to attain a result by a
method unrelated to the narrow
purpose of the bill. The pending
proposition in those cases was not
diverse and therefore not suscep-
tible to the amendments ruled
out.
Bill Amending 1937 Flood Con-
trol 
Act—Amendment 
To
Amend 1936 Act
Be it enacted, etc., That section 2
of the Flood Control Act of August

as follows:
‘‘That the Secretary of War is
hereby authorized to allot not to ex-
ceed $300,000 from any appropria-
tions heretofore or hereafter made
for any one fiscal year for flood con-
trol, for removing accumulated snags
and other debris and clearing chan-
nels in navigable streams and tribu-
taries thereof when in the opinion of
the Chief of Engineers such work is
advisable in the interest of flood con-
trol: Provided, That not more than
$25,000 shall be allotted for this pur-
pose for any single tributary from
the appropriations for any one fiscal
year.’’
Sec. 2. Funds heretofore or here-
after appropriated for construction
and maintenance of flood-control
works by the War Department shall
be available for expenditure by the
War Department in making exami-
nations and surveys for flood control
heretofore or hereafter authorized, or
in preparing reports in review there-
of as authorized by law, in addition
to funds heretofore authorized to be
expended for such purposes by the
War Department.

AMENDMENTS AND THE GERMANENESS RULE
Ch. 28 § 35
hereby made applicable to author-
ized works of flood control. . . .
MR. [LOUIS L.] LUDLOW [of Indiana]:
Mr. Speaker, I offer an amendment.
The Clerk read as follows:
Flood Control Act of 1938. They are
perfecting amendments. The gentle-
man’s amendment is an amendment to
the act of 1936, that is in no way in-
volved in this bill, as it relates to local
contributions for levees and flood
walls.
So I make the point of order that the
amendment is not germane to the bill
under consideration or any section
thereof.
THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE [Sam
Rayburn, of Texas]: The Chair is ready
to rule.
MR. [CASSIUS C.] DOWELL [of Iowa]:
Mr. Speaker, the amendment sub-
mitted by the gentleman from Indiana
merely asks to relieve the city from the
payment of what is due under the law
and is in no way germane to the ques-
tion before the House.
THE
SPEAKER
PRO
TEMPORE: The
Chair is ready to rule.
The bill before the House is a bill to
amend the Flood Control Act of 1937.
That act had one purpose. The Flood
Control Act of 1936 had another pur-
pose. The gentleman from Indiana (Mr.
Ludlow) offers an amendment as an
amendment to the Flood Control Act of
1936. The amendment clearly is not
germane to this bill, and the Chair
sustains the point of order.
Amendment offered by Mr. Lud-
low: On page 2, after the word ‘‘de-
partment’’ in line 12, insert a new
section, as follows:
‘‘Sec. 3. Section 3 of the act enti-
tled ‘An act authorizing the construc-
tion of certain public works on rivers
and harbors for flood control, and for
other purposes’, approved June 22,
1936, as amended, is amended by
adding before the period at the end
thereof a colon and the following:
‘And provided further, That if, after
investigation, the President finds
that any city or town is, by reason of
its financial condition, unable to
comply with the requirements of this
section as to local cooperation, he is
hereby authorized to waive such re-
quirements on any individual levee
or flood-wall project not to exceed 50
percent of the estimated costs of the
lands, 
easements, 
and 
rights-of-
way.’ ’’
‘‘The first paragraph of section 2 of
the act entitled ‘An act authorizing
the construction of certain public
works on rivers and harbors for flood
control, and for other purposes, ap-
proved June 28, 1938, is amended to
read as follows:
‘‘ ‘That section 3 of the act of June
22, 1936 (Public, No. 738, 74th
Cong.), as heretofore amended, as
herein further modified, and as
amended after June 28, 1938, shall
apply to all flood-control projects, ex-
cept as otherwise specifically pro-
vided by law.’ ’’
Endangered 
Species 
Act—
Amendment Giving Respon-
sibilities to Parties Not With-
in Coverage of Bill
MR. [WILLIAM M.] WHITTINGTON [of
Mississippi]: Mr. Speaker, I make the
point of order that, as I said, this
amendment is not germane to the bill.
The bill undertakes to amend the
Flood Control Act of 1937 and the
§ 35.104 To a bill amending the
Endangered Species Act, an
amendment providing that a
Corps of Engineers permit
8967
DESCHLER-BROWN PRECEDENTS

cited as the ‘‘Endangered Species Act
Amendments of 1978’’.
Sec. 2. Section 4 of the Endan-
gered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C.
1533) is amended—
(1) by adding at the end of sub-
section (a)(1) the following new sen-
tence: ‘‘At the time any such regula-
tion is proposed, the Secretary shall
also by regulation, to the maximum
extent prudent, specify any habitat
of such species which is then consid-
ered to be critical habitat. The re-
quirement of the preceding sentence
shall not apply with respect to any
species which was listed prior to en-
actment of the Endangered Species
Act Amendments of 1978.’’. . .
MR. [TENO] RONCALIO [of Wyoming]:
Mr. Chairman, I offer an amendment.
The Clerk read as follows:
for a power project, and
Rural 
Electrification 
loan
guarantee commitments and
approvals be deemed to sat-
isfy the requirements of the
Endangered Species Act and
of other environmental acts,
and directing the Corps and
the Administration, after the
rendering of an opinion by
the Fish and Wildlife Service
and in consultation with the
Secretary of the Interior, to
require modifications in the
project 
to 
protect 
endan-
gered species and their habi-
tats, and a similar amend-
ment only omitting the ref-
erences 
to 
other 
environ-
mental acts, were held not
germane 
since 
broadening
the responsibilities and au-
thorities of agencies not cov-
ered by the bill.
During consideration of H.R.
14014 in the Committee of the
Whole on Oct. 14, 1978,(17) the
Chair sustained a point of order
in the circumstances described
above. The proceedings were as
follows:
The Clerk read as follows:
Be it enacted by the Senate and
House 
of 
Representatives 
of 
the
United States of America in Congress
assembled, That this Act may be

38134, 
38140,
38141, 95th Cong. 2d Sess.
Amendment offered by Mr. Ron-
calio: On page 32, after line 21, add
new section (No. 12) as follows:
‘‘The Department of the Army Per-
mit to Basin Electric Power Coopera-
tive for the Missouri Basin Power
Project, issued on March 23, 1978, as
amended October 10, 1978, is hereby
ratified and shall be deemed to sat-
isfy the requirements of the Endan-
gered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 et
seq.) as amended, and the Rural
Electrification Administration loan
guarantee commitments and approv-
als associated therewith relating to
the Missouri Basin Power Project are
deemed to satisfy the requirements
of the Endangered Species Act; Pro-
vided, That following the rendering
of a biological opinion by the United
States Fish and Wildlife Service con-
cerning the effect, if any, of the oper-
ation of the Missouri Basin Power
Project on endangered species or
their critical habitat, the responsible
officers of the Rural Electrification
Administration and of the Army
Corps of Engineers shall require
such modifications in the operation
of the Project as they and the Sec-

retary of Interior may determine are
required to insure that actions au-
thorized, funded, or carried out by
them, relating to the Missouri Basin
Power Project do not jeopardize the
continued existence of such endan-
gered species and threatened species
or result in the destruction or modi-
fication of habitat of such species
which is or has been determined to
be critical, by the Secretary of the
Interior, after consultation as appro-
priate with the affected States.’’. . .
MR. RONCALIO: Mr. Chairman, I can-
not imagine how a point of order could
be reserved on the amendment at this
point.
The precise objections to the last
amendment (18) were stricken from this
amendment, and this amendment is
left with a citation of only one statute,
and that is the Endangered Species
Act, which is precisely the statute be-
fore us at this time. I cannot imagine
an attack on the germaneness provi-
sion at this point.
I have stricken from my first amend-
ment all reference to the Army Corps
of Engineers, all reference to the Na-
tional Environmental Policy Act of
1969, and all reference to the Federal
Water Pollution Control Act. There is
only one act cited in the amendment,
and that is precisely the one before
us. . . .
MR. [JOHN J.] CAVANAUGH [of Ne-
braska]: Mr. Chairman, I make a point
of order against the amendment on the
basis that the amendment is not ger-
mane to the bill. The differences be-
tween this amendment and the amend-
ment previously offered are that the
gentleman from Wyoming has stricken
specific references in the first portion
of his amendment to the National En-
vironmental Policy Act, the Federal
Water Pollution Control Act, and the
Rural Electrification Act, but the gen-
tleman’s amendment has not stricken
new responsibilities imposed upon the
Rural Electrification Administration,
the Army Corps of Engineers, the Fish
and Wildlife Service, and the Secretary
of the Interior.
The amendment would continue to
require biological opinion by the Fish
and Wildlife Service, and require addi-
tional duties of responsible officers of
the REA, the Corps of Engineers; to re-
quire modifications of the project.
In addition, it requires the Secretary
of the Interior to consult with the ap-
propriate affected states, which would
also be a new obligation not envisioned
in the act imposed upon agencies of
Government. In addition to that, the
amendment is not germane to the sec-
tion. It appears as a new section fol-
lowing section 32, a section dealing
with certain antique articles.
So, I would renew my point of order
as to germaneness both to the bill and
to the section.
THE CHAIRMAN: (19) The Chair is pre-
pared to rule.
Actually, the amendment adds a new
section, let the Chair say to the gen-
tleman from Nebraska, which in the
opinion of the Chair would need only
be germane to the bill as a whole.
However, the earlier matter cited by
the gentleman from Nebraska in his
point of order dealing with the ex-
panded authority and responsibilities
and obligations of the Rural Elec-
trification Administration and Army

law has been held not to be ger-
mane.(5)
Corps of Engineers is still a part of the
amendment as the Chair views it.
Therefore, the Chair would have to
sustain the point of order on the basis
that it would still expand authorities
which are not within the coverage of
the bill.

pealing the law is not germane.
Thus, to a bill establishing a new

Similarly, to an amendment pro-

entirety is not germane,(3) unless
