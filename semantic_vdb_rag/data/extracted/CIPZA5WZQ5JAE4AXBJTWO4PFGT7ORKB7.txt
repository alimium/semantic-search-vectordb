Notice of Final Results of Antidumping 
Duty Administrative Review: Furfuryl 
Alcohol from Thailand 
Scope of the Order 
The merchandise covered by this 
order is furfuryl alcohol 
(C4H3OCH2OH). Furfuryl alcohol is a 
primary alcohol, and is colorless or pale 
yellow in appearance. It is used in the 
manufacture of resins and as a wetting 
agent and solvent for coating resins, 
nitrocellulose, cellulose acetate, and 
other soluble dyes. 
The product subject to this order is 
classifiable under subheading 
2932.13.00 of the Harmonized Tariff 
Schedule of the United States (HTSUS). 
Although the HTSUS subheading is 
provided for convenience and customs 
purposes, our written description of the 
scope of this proceeding is dispositive. 
On July 26, 2007, the Department of 
Commerce (‘‘the Department’’) 
published a preliminary notice of intent 
to rescind the antidumping duty new 
shipper review of certain frozen warm 
water shrimp from the People’s 
Republic of China (‘‘PRC’’) with respect 
to Maoming Changxing Foods Co., Ltd. 
(‘‘Maoming Changxing’’), covering the 
period February 1, 2006, through July 
31, 2007. See Certain Frozen 
Warmwater Shrimp from the People’s 
Republic of China: Preliminary Notice of 
Intent to Rescind Antidumping Duty 
New Shipper Review, 72 FR 41058 (July 
26, 2007). 
Period of Review 
The period of review (‘‘POR’’) is July 
1, 2005, through May 3, 2006.1 
Extension of Time Limit of Final 
Results 
AGENCY: Import Administration, 
International Trade Administration, 
Department of Commerce. 
SUMMARY: On August 2, 2007, the 
Department of Commerce published the 
preliminary results of the administrative 
review of the antidumping duty order 
on furfuryl alcohol from Thailand. The 
period of review is July 1, 2005, through 
May 3, 2006. The final results do not 
differ from the preliminary results of 
this review, in which we found that 
sales of the subject merchandise have 
not been made below normal value. 
EFFECTIVE DATE: October 12, 2007. 
Final Results of Review 
As noted above, the Department 
received no comments concerning the 
Preliminary Results. Consistent with the 
Preliminary Results, we find that a de 
minimis (i.e., less than 0.50 percent) 
dumping margin exists for Indorama 
Chemicals (Thailand) Ltd. during the 
POR. Because no party submitted 
comments on the Preliminary Results 
and the Department has not made any 
changes to the Preliminary Results, we 
have not prepared a Decision 
Memorandum for these final results. For 
further details of our findings, see the 
Preliminary Results.

1 On August 30, 2006, the Department published 
a notice of initiation for this administrative review 
covering the period July 1, 2005, through June 30, 
2006. See Notice of Initiation of Antidumping and 
Countervailing Duty Administrative Reviews, 71 FR 
51573 (August 30, 2006). However, following the 
initiation, the Department has revoked this order 
effective May 4, 2006. See Furfuryl Alcohol from 
Thailand; Final Results of the Second Sunset 
Review of the Antidumping Duty Order and 
Revocation of the Order, 72 FR 9729 (March 5, 
2007). Therefore, the revised POR is now July 1, 
2005 through May 3, 2006. 
The final results for this new shipper 
review are currently due on October 17, 
2007. Consistent with section 
751(a)(2)(B)(iv) of the Tariff Act of 1930, 
as amended (‘‘Act’’) and 19 CFR 
351.214(i)(2), the Department is 
extending the time limit for the 
completion of the final results of this 
new shipper review by 60 days because 
the case is extraordinarily complicated. 
This new shipper review involves 
complicated ownership and affiliation 
issues which will require the 
Department to consider arguments by 
interested parties regarding the actual 
owners and the source of founding 
capital with respect to Maoming 
Changxing. In addition, the Department 
requires additional time to consider 
domestic producers’ arguments 
regarding the antidumping duty rate to 
apply to Maoming Changxing. 
Because of the complexity of issues in 
this case, and in accordance with 
section 751(a)(2)(B)(iv) of the Act and 19 
CFR 351.214(i)(2), we are extending the 
time period for issuing the final results 
of the new shipper review of Maoming 
Changxing by 60 days. Since a 60-day 
extension would result in the deadline 
for the final results falling on December 
16, 2007, which is Sunday, the new 
deadline for the final results will be the 
next business day, December 17, 2007.

of ‘‘Next Business Day’’ Rule for

BILLING CODE 3510–DS–S 
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The 
Advisory Council for Cordell Bank was 
established in 2002 to support the joint 
management plan review process 
currently underway for the CBNMS and 
its neighboring sanctuaries, Gulf of the 
Farallones and Monterey Bay National 
Marine Sanctuaries. The Council has 
members representing education, 
research, conservation, maritime 
activity, and community-at-large. The 
government seats are held by 
representatives from the National 
Marine Fisheries Service, the United 
States Coast Guard, and the managers of 
the Gulf of the Farallones, Monterey Bay 
and Channel Islands National Marine 
Sanctuaries. The Council holds four 
regular meetings per year, and one 
annual retreat.

to issue assessment instructions to CBP 
15 days after the publication date of 
these final results. Because the 
respondent did not report the entered 
value of its U.S. sales, pursuant to 19 
CFR 351.212(b)(1), we have calculated 
importer–specific per–unit duty 
assessment rates by aggregating the total 
amount of antidumping duties 
calculated for the examined sales and 
dividing this amount by the total 
quantity of those sales. To determine 
whether the duty assessment rates are 
de minimis, in accordance with the 
requirement set forth in 19 CFR 
351.106(c)(2), we calculated importer 
(or customer)-specific ad valorem ratios 
based on the estimated entered value. 
Where an importer (or customer)- 
specific ad valorem rate is zero or de 
minimis, we will instruct CBP to 
liquidate appropriate entries without 
regard to antidumping duties. 
The Department clarified its 
‘‘automatic assessment’’ regulation on 
May 6, 2003 (68 FR 23954). This 
clarification will apply to entries of 
subject merchandise during the period 
of review produced by reviewed 
companies for which these companies 
did not know their merchandise was 
destined for the United States. In such 
instances, we will instruct CBP to 
liquidate unreviewed entries at the all– 
others rate if there is no rate for the 
intermediate company(ies) involved in 
the transaction. For a full discussion of 
this clarification, see Antidumping and 
Countervailing Duty Proceedings: 
Assessment of Antidumping Duties, 68
