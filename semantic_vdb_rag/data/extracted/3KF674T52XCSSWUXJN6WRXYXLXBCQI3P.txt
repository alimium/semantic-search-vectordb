Foreword
 
The purpose of this manual is to provide guidance on the development and implementation of a 
cross-connection control (CCC) program that will comply with the drinking water regulations, 
Chapter 246-290-490 Washington Administrative Code.  This manual was prepared for Group A 
public water systems with less than 1,000 connections. 
 
Although the elements of a CCC program for small, medium, and large water systems are 
essentially the same, a small water system program may often be streamlined to: 
 
• 
Suit the lower health risk posed by a predominantly residential customer base; and 
 
• 
Reduce the purveyor's program administration, and thus, operating costs.   
 
This manual is divided into the following general areas: 
 
• 
Chapters 1 through 5 provide an overview of cross-connection control; 
 
• 
Chapter 6 outlines the decisions to be made when starting a CCC program; 
 
• 
Chapter 7 addresses day-to-day program operation;  
 
• 
Chapter 8 contains the CCC regulations and related reference materials; and 
 
• 
The appendices provide reference materials, including sample written program plans.

Chapter 1. Purpose 
 
The purpose of this guidance manual is to: 
 
• 
Explain the need for a cross-connection control (CCC) program; 
 
• 
Summarize Washington State Department of Health (DOH) regulatory requirements for 
developing and implementing a CCC program; 
 
• 
Outline the options available for complying with CCC regulations; and 
 
• 
Provide information to assist purveyors with the day-to-day implementation of a CCC 
program.  
 
This manual is designed to provide guidance and resource information on cross-connection control 
to DOH-certified cross-connection control specialists, CCC program managers, public water system 
managers, water system governing bodies, public water system legal counsel, and Local 
Administrative Authorities (building/plumbing officials).  The manual was developed for Group A 
public water systems with less than 1,000 connections. 
 
For small water systems that contract with a DOH-certified cross-connection control specialist 
(CCS) for development of a program, this manual can be used as a resource to help ensure that the 
contractor’s program includes all the elements discussed in Chapters 6 and 7. 
 
Throughout this manual, the terms must, shall, and required are used to indicate a Washington State 
regulatory requirement.  The terms should or recommend are used to indicate recommended 
procedures, schedules, and/or criteria.

Chapter 2. Introduction 
 
2.1 
Overview of Cross-Connection Control 
 
A cross connection is defined as any actual or potential physical connection between a public water 
system or the consumer's water system and any source of non-potable liquid, solid, or gas that could 
contaminate the potable water supply by backflow.  Cross connections exist in all plumbing 
systems. Cross connections may also exist in the purveyor’s water system facilities.   
 
There are numerous well-documented cases where drinking water has been contaminated via 
unprotected cross connections.  These cases have caused illness, injury, and in some cases, death, to 
consumers served by the system. 
 
The task of eliminating all cross connections is enormous.  However, all purveyors can implement 
CCC programs that reasonably reduce the risk of contamination to their systems.  For a drinking 
water (potable water) supply to become contaminated via a cross connection, three things need to 
happen simultaneously: 
 
1. The potable water supply piping must be unprotected (or improperly protected) from a cross 
connection;  
 
2. A physical cross connection must be made between the potable water supply piping and a 
contaminant source; and 
 
3. Backflow conditions must occur. 
 
Backflow is the flow of water (or other solid, liquid, or gas from any source) back into the potable 
water supply.  Backflow may be due to either: 
 
• 
Backsiphonage; or 
 
• 
Backpressure. 
 
2.2 
Causes of Backflow:  Backsiphonage 
 
Backsiphonage is backflow caused by a negative pressure (vacuum or partial vacuum) in the supply 
piping.  Backsiphonage occurs when system pressure is reduced below atmospheric pressure.  The 
effect is similar to sipping water through a straw. 
 
The following scenario illustrates how backsiphonage backflow conditions could occur in a public 
water system:  
 
• A public water system main is shut off to repair a leak.  The water main is at the base of a 
hill. 
_______________________________________________________________________________________________ 
Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems 
March 2004 
Chapter 2 
Page 3 
 
• The water main is at a lower elevation than the homes on the hill.  This creates a situation 
where water in the plumbing in the homes on the hill can drain into the public water 
system main.  
 
• When a customer at the bottom of the hill uses water, a siphon is created at households at 
the top of the hill and water drains out of their plumbing systems.  
 
• At one household at the top of the hill, a garden hose is being used to fill a child's wading 
pool.  The hose is submerged in the pool.  See Illustration 1. 
 
• When the backflow conditions occur, the non-potable water from the wading pool is 
siphoned through the cross connection (submerged hose) into the household plumbing 
and then into the water main.  
 
• The water from the wading pool contaminates the water main.  
 
• When water service is restored, contaminated water is delivered to customers served by 
the public water system.

2.3 
Causes of Backflow:  Backpressure 
 
Backpressure is backflow caused by pressure in the customer's plumbing being greater than the 
pressure in the water supply piping.  The higher pressure in the customer's plumbing may be from a 
booster pump, heating boiler, etc.  
 
The following scenario illustrates how backpressure backflow could occur in a water system:  
 
1. The fire department withdraws water from a hydrant.  This reduces the pressure in the 
public water system main from 50 pounds per square inch (psi) to 20 psi. 
 
2. A customer served by the public water system installed a lawn irrigation system.  The 
customer’s irrigation system is supplied with water from a pond.  The pump supplying the 
irrigation system operates at 30 psi.  To ensure a supply for the irrigation system when the 
pond is dry, the customer installed a standby connection to the household plumbing (potable 
water piping). 
 
3. On the day of the fire flow situation, the normally closed valve between the household 
plumbing and irrigation piping is accidentally left open. 
 
4. Backflow wouldn’t normally occur at this customer’s connection, because the pressure in 
the public water system is greater than the pressure supplied by the irrigation pump.  
However, during the fire flow situation, the pressure from the irrigation pump is greater than 
the pressure in the water main.  Water from the pond is pumped into the household 
plumbing, and then into the public water system main.  See Illustration 2. 
 
5. When the fire flow ends, pressure in the public water system water main increases, and 
contaminated water is delivered to customers served by the system.   
 
See Illustration 2.

2.4 
Methods of Backflow Prevention 
 
Backflow can be prevented in two ways, either through installation of: 
 
1. An approved air gap (AG) that provides a physical separation between the contaminant and 
the drinking water supply; or  
 
2. Mechanical devices or assemblies that prevent backflow from occurring.  
 
Air gaps (AGs) are commonly used to prevent backflow in household plumbing systems.  Examples 
of AGs can be found in typical household kitchens and bathrooms.  The physical separation 
between the kitchen faucet and kitchen sink rim is an approved AG.  Similarly, the physical 
separations between the bathroom faucets and rims of the sinks and bathtubs are approved AGs.  
Current plumbing codes require all sinks and bathtubs sold in the United States to have “built in” 
approved AGs (designed for above the rim faucets) to prevent contamination of the household 
plumbing. 
 
In addition to AGs, there are several methods of preventing backflow by mechanical means. 
These range from simple single check valves to elaborate approved backflow prevention 
assemblies.  All mechanical devices and assemblies will prevent backflow to some degree when 
properly installed and maintained.  However, not all mechanical devices and assemblies are 
created equal.  Thus, not all mechanical devices and assemblies provide equivalent backflow 
protection.

In fact, backflow preventers can be differentiated by a number of characteristics: 
 
1. Backflow application conditions; 
 
2. Degree of hazard; 
 
3. Design; 
 
4. Approval requirements; and 
 
5. Use for premises isolation.  
 
These characteristics are important to consider when deciding which type of backflow preventer 
to use to protect the public water system from contamination.  The discussion below provides 
further detail.   
 
Regarding backflow application conditions, some devices and assemblies are designed to 
prevent backsiphonage backflow only.  These are not effective in preventing backflow under 
backpressure conditions.  Others are designed to prevent both backsiphonage and backpressure 
backflow.  When selecting a backflow preventer to protect the public water system, the purveyor 
must make sure that the preventer is suitable for the backflow application conditions likely to 
occur for a particular connection (or fixture). 
 
Backflow preventers must also be commensurate with the degree of health hazard (high vs. low) 
posed by the customer’s plumbing system (or fixture) to the public water system.  For example, 
some backflow preventers (i.e., assemblies) are manufactured to a very high standard, and thus, 
are more reliable in preventing backflow than devices manufactured to a lower standard.  The 
more reliable assemblies must be used to prevent backflow in high hazard cross-connection 
situations.   
 
Regarding backflow preventer design, an important difference between various types of 
backflow preventers is whether the design allows them to be tested and repaired while in-line.  
The purpose of the testing is to determine whether they are properly functioning to prevent 
backflow.  Preventers that are not testable are called devices, whereas assemblies are preventers 
designed for in-line testing and repair.  Assemblies include isolating valves and test cocks. 
 
Regarding approval status, in Washington, backflow preventers that protect public water systems 
from contamination via cross connections must appear on the Backflow Prevention Assemblies 
Approved for Installation in Washington published by DOH.  Yet, not all backflow preventers 
appear on the approved list.  The list identifies only those assemblies that have successfully 
completed rigorous laboratory and field tests conducted by the University of Southern California’s 
Foundation for Cross-Connection Control and Hydraulic Research.  It is important for purveyors to 
ensure that all assemblies relied upon to protect the public water system appear on the above named 
list.

The last difference between the various types of backflow preventers is whether they can be used to 
isolate the customer’s plumbing from the public water system distribution system.  This concept is 
called premises isolation.  Premises isolation assemblies are usually located at the meter or property 
line.  Some assemblies can be used for premises isolation, whereas others are used to prevent 
backflow at fixtures only.  The concept of installing a backflow preventer at a particular fixture, 
such as a boiler, is called fixture protection.  When selecting a backflow preventer for a specific 
situation, it is important to consider whether the preventer is to be used for premises isolation or 
fixture protection.  Note:  Washington Administrative Code (WAC) 246-290-490(4) mandates 
premises isolation for high hazard premises.   
 
The following list identifies mechanical backflow preventers available on the market and their 
respective acronyms.  The list identifies non-testable devices first and then identifies testable 
assemblies. 
 
1. Devices 
 
a. Residential Meter Check / Single-Check Valve (CV) 
 
b. Dual-Check Backflow Preventer (DCV) 
 
c. Dual-Check with Atmospheric Vent (DCAV) 
 
d. Hose Bibb Vacuum Breaker (HBVB) 
 
e. Atmospheric Vacuum Breaker (AVB) 
 
2. Assemblies 
 
a. Spill-Resistant Vacuum Breaker Assembly (SVBA) 
 
b. Pressure Vacuum Breaker Assembly (PVBA) 
 
c. Double-Check Valve Assembly (DCVA) 
 
d. Double-Check Detector Assembly (DCDA) 
 
e. Reduced-Pressure Backflow Assembly (RPBA) 
 
f. Reduced-Pressure Detector Assembly (RPDA) 
 
Note:  The term "detector" in the above assemblies list refers to a small water meter installed in a 
by-pass arrangement for detection of water use.  These are most often used for fire sprinkler 
installations.

For protection of a public water system from contamination, DOH recognizes as acceptable 
methods of backflow prevention approved: 
 
1. Air gaps (AG); 
 
2. Reduced-pressure backflow assemblies (RPBA);  
 
3. Reduced-pressure detector assemblies (RPDA); 
 
4. Double-check valve assemblies (DCVA); 
 
5. Double-check detector assemblies (DCDA); 
 
6. Pressure vacuum breaker assemblies (PVBA);  
 
7. Spill-resistant vacuum breaker assemblies (SVBA); and 
 
8. Atmospheric vacuum breakers (AVB).  
 
As mentioned previously, WAC 246-290-490 (4) requires premises isolation for high-hazard 
premises.  These premises must be isolated from the public water system by an approved AG or 
RPBA.  Other assemblies, such as DCVAs, may be used for premises isolation for lower hazard 
situations.  Table 1 shows which backflow preventers are suitable for various combinations of 
backflow application conditions and health hazards that purveyors may encounter. 
 
For premises that are not considered high hazard, the purveyor may rely on assemblies and/or 
devices installed within the customer’s plumbing system to protect the public water system.   
Note:  The latter is allowed, because the backflow assemblies and/or devices installed within the 
customer's plumbing system reduce the health risk to a level where an approved assembly is not 
required at the meter to protect the public water system.  Devices may be used where an approved 
assembly is not required.

Chapter 3. State and Federal Regulations and Jurisdictions 
 
3.1  
Overview of Federal and State Drinking Water Regulations 
 
The Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) passed by Congress in 1974 authorized the development of 
national regulations to ensure safe drinking water for consumers served by public water systems.  
The 1974 Safe Drinking Water Act and subsequent amendments (through 2002) do not 
specifically address the topic of cross-connection control.  However, the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency is currently considering development of federal CCC rules.  Thus, federal CCC 
rules may be promulgated sometime in the future. 
 
 
 
Current federal drinking water rules do not 
specifically require the purveyor to have a cross-
connection control program. 
 
 
 
Confusion about cross-connection control has arisen, due to the belief by some purveyors that, 
under the SDWA, the "purveyor is responsible for water quality to the last free-flowing tap."  This 
confusion may have resulted from some federal rules that require purveyors to monitor certain water 
quality parameters (i.e., lead and copper levels) in samples collected at the customer's tap.   
 
However, under the SDWA, purveyors are only responsible for the water quality delivered to 
customers at the meter.  The purveyor is not responsible for contaminants added to the water by 
circumstances under the control of the customer (i.e., beyond the meter).   
 
 
 
Under federal rules, the purveyor is only 
responsible for the water quality delivered to the 
customer’s meter. 
 
 
 
Under the SDWA, the federal government may grant state governments "primacy" for the 
administration and enforcement of the federal drinking water regulations.  States with primacy must 
adopt drinking water regulations that are at least as stringent as the federal drinking water rules.  
Washington is a primacy state.

Public Water Systems in the State of Washington 
Besides adopting the federal drinking water rules, primacy states may adopt additional (or more 
stringent) drinking water regulations as long as they are not in conflict with the SDWA and/or 
federal rules.  In Washington, CCC requirements are state-imposed.  Similarly, lower levels of 
government (e.g., counties and cities) within the state, with the authority of the state, may impose 
additional (or more stringent) regulations as long as they are not in conflict with the state 
regulations.   
 
Both federal and state governments regulate the public health aspects of drinking water “to protect 
the health, safety, or welfare of the users of water.”  These regulatory entities “govern the 
manufacturers and distributors of water” (e.g., water utilities, bottled water plants, etc.).  
Regulations apply to the entity that owns (controls) the facilities for the manufacture and/or 
distribution of water.  The higher level of government (the State) regulates government entities (e.g., 
a city or water district) that own water utilities.  Figure 1 illustrates the hierarchical relationship in 
the regulatory authority of the federal and state levels of government with respect to public water 
systems.

In Washington State, the laws (statutes) enacted by the legislature are published in the Revised 
Code of Washington (RCW).  The RCWs establish general statutory authority.  Subordinate to the 
RCWs, state agencies or boards, such as the State Board of Health adopt administrative rules 
through the Washington Administrative Code (WAC).  The WACs provide details consistent with 
the RCWs.  In addition to administrative rules, state agencies may issue guidance documents and/or 
other reference materials on how to comply with the RCWs and WACs.  RCWs and WACs are 
enforceable by the State, whereas guidelines are not enforceable. 
 
Chapter 43 of the Revised Code of Washington assigns to DOH the responsibility to "Review and 
approve plans for public water system design, engineering, operation maintenance, financing, and 
emergency response, as required under State Board of Health rules."  The RCW defines a public 
water system as “any system, excluding a system serving only one single-family residence and a 
system with four or fewer connections all of which serve residences on the same farm, providing 
piped water for human consumption, including any collection, treatment, storage, or distribution 
facilities under control of the purveyor and used primarily in connection with the system."  This 
definition is consistent with the federal SDWA definition of a public water system. 
 
The definition of public water system goes to the heart of the regulatory authority of DOH and the 
purveyors it regulates.  For most purveyors, control ends at the water meter to the customer's 
premises.  The meter would be located within a public street right-of-way or within a utility 
easement.  Public water systems where the owner controls (owns) the collection through distribution 
facilities and the plumbing system would be considered exceptions.  These could include both non-
transient (e.g., schools) and transient (e.g., gambling casino) non-community systems as well as 
some community systems. 
 
 
 
WAC 246-290 (Group A Drinking Water 
Regulations) applies only to the purveyor and not 
to the purveyor’s customers. 
 
 
 
3.2 
Jurisdictions of Washington State Department of Health and Other 
State Agencies Relating to Cross-Connection Control  
 
The state legislature may assign the administration and enforcement of statutes and regulations to 
different departments (agencies) within state government.  In Washington, several state departments 
have responsibilities for the administration and/or enforcement of CCC-related regulations.   
 
These agencies include, but are not necessarily limited to: 
 
• Washington State Department of Health (DOH);

3.2.1 Washington State Department of Health Regulates Cross-Connection 
Control for Public Water Systems 
 
As mentioned above, DOH is one of several agencies with regulations pertaining to cross-
connection control.  DOH Office of Drinking Water administers and enforces drinking water 
regulations for public water systems as set forth in Chapter 246-290 WAC.  The mission of the 
Office of Drinking Water is to protect the health of the people of Washington State by ensuring safe 
and reliable drinking water.   
 
The requirement for public water systems to develop and implement CCC programs as set forth in 
WAC 246-290-490 is consistent with the mission of the Office of Drinking Water.  Except for 
certain types of public water systems where the consumption of water is solely within the property 
owned by the purveyor, the jurisdiction of WAC 246-290-490 ends at the purveyor's water meter. 
 
3.2.2 Other State Agencies with Plumbing-Related Cross-Connection Control 
Responsibilities 
 
The primary regulation of plumbing and plumber certification falls under the jurisdiction of two 
different agencies.  These agencies are the: 
 
• Washington State Building Code Council (SBCC); and  
 
• Washington State Department of Labor and Industries (L&I).    
 
The SBCC adopts the Uniform Plumbing Code (UPC) with state amendments specific to 
Washington (under RCW 19.27).  The UPC applies within the property lines of the customer's 
premises.  Labor and Industries enforces plumber certification requirements (under RCW 
18.106).  The plumber certification requirements apply within buildings only.  Information on 
the full text of these statutes is available through the following website: 
http://www.access.wa.gov/ 
 
Further information about the respective jurisdictions of these agencies is provided below. 
 
 
 
WAC 246-290 applies to the collection, treatment, storage 
and distribution facilities under the purveyor’s control. 
 
RCW 19.27 (Uniform Plumbing Code) applies within the 
property lines of the customer’s premises. 
 
RCW 18.106 (requirement for certified plumbers) applies 
within buildings only.

Washington State Building Code Council 
 
Washington State Building Code Council (SBCC) establishes the minimum requirements for the 
design and installation of plumbing in Washington through adoption of the Uniform Plumbing Code 
(often referred to as the UPC).  The UPC is applicable statewide.  As mentioned above, the UPC 
applies within the property lines of the customer’s premises.  The UPC in effect in Washington 
includes amendments specific to Washington.  These include a number of CCC amendments.   
 
The various departments of state government are not supposed to adopt contradictory regulations, 
including regulations on cross-connection control.  Thus, during the most recent major revision 
process of the CCC regulations for Group A public water systems, DOH worked closely with the 
SBCC to ensure greater consistency between WAC 246-290-490 and the UPC (as amended for 
Washington).  To ensure this consistency, DOH has continued to work closely with the SBCC on 
subsequent revisions to the UPC.   
 
In fact, starting with the 1997 Uniform Plumbing Code, the SBCC has adopted a number of CCC 
amendments to maintain or enhance consistency with WAC 246-290-490.  Information on 
Washington State’s amendments to the UPC can be found on the SBCC website.  Their web address 
is:  http://www.sbcc.wa.gov/ 
 
Although the SBCC is responsible for adoption of the UPC, Local Administrative Authorities (i.e., 
local building and/or plumbing officials) administer and enforce the UPC.  Customers (i.e., owners 
of potable water plumbing) must comply with the UPC in effect at the time of installation, whether 
or not the Local Administrative Authority inspects the plumbing.   
 
Note:  RCW 19.27 does not provide authority for purveyors to regulate plumbing.  In fact, most 
purveyors have no authority, and thus, no responsibility, beyond the meter for the customer's 
compliance with the UPC.  The only exception to this would be systems where the purveyor owns 
the water supply through distribution facilities and the plumbing. 
 
Washington State Department of Labor and Industries 
 
Washington State Department of Labor and Industries (L&I) requires persons engaged in the craft 
of plumbing to be certified.  The craft of plumbing includes installing, repairing and replacing 
plumbing and applies within buildings only.  Some plumbing activities require a journeyman’s 
plumber certificate, whereas other plumbing activities, such as backflow assembly repair, require 
only a specialty plumber certificate.   
 
The plumber certification requirements may impact some DOH-certified Backflow Assembly 
Testers (BATs) working in a purveyor’s service area.  WAC 246-290-490 and the UPC (WAC 51-
0603.3) both require DOH-certified BATs to conduct backflow prevention assembly (BPA) testing. 
 RCW 18.106 requires certified journeyman plumbers to install backflow prevention assemblies 
within buildings.   
 
_______________________________________________________________________________________________ 
Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems 
March 2004 
Chapter 3 
Page 16 
 
In 2001, RCW 18.106 was amended and a new specialty plumber certification for backflow 
assembly maintenance and repair was created.  Effective January 1, 2003, BATs that repair 
backflow prevention assemblies within buildings must hold a valid specialty plumber certificate 
issued by L&I.  Further information on the plumbing certification laws and regulations can be 
obtained by accessing the following website:   
http://www.lni.wa.gov/scs/plumbing/ 
 
Summary 
 
In summary, a DOH-certified BAT must test any assembly that the purveyor relies upon to protect 
the public water system.  However, only a journeyman plumber or a DOH-certified tester holding a 
current specialty plumbing certification may repair the assembly if it is located within a building.   
 
Purveyors may wish to recommend that any customer with one or more in-premises assemblies hire 
a DOH-certified BAT that also holds a specialty plumbing certificate (in case the customer’s 
assembly needs to be repaired).  Illustration 3 shows, for a typical community water system, the 
respective jurisdictions of the water purveyor, Local Administrative Authority and L&I.

3.3 
History of Cross-Connection Control Regulations in Washington 
 
Chapter 246-290 WAC is the primary document currently used by DOH to administer the RCWs 
that address public water systems and the protection of drinking water.  Since 1970, public water 
systems in Washington have been required to develop CCC programs to protect their systems from 
contamination.  In fact, the 1978 cross-connection regulations (WAC 248-54-820) included 
essentially all the program requirements of the current WAC 246-290-490.  Specifically, WAC 248-
54-820 included the following statement: 
 
 
"A continuing and aggressive program of cross-connection investigation, surveillance and 
control shall be implemented according to good CCC practice such as Accepted Procedure 
and Practice in Cross-Connection Control Manual - Pacific Northwest Section - American 
Waterworks Association, Second Edition." 
 
The current WAC 246-290-490 differs from previous regulations by: 
 
• 
Clarifying the jurisdiction of the water purveyor versus Local Administrative Authority  
 
(e.g., local building and plumbing officials) with regards to cross-connection control; 
 
• 
Listing and providing details on the minimum elements of a CCC program, rather than 
merely referencing the CCC manual published by the Pacific Northwest Section of the 
American Water Works Association (PNWS-AWWA); and 
 
• 
Identifying specific categories of high hazard premises for which premises isolation is 
mandated. 
 
Details on the current CCC regulations are provided in Chapter 4.  A copy of WAC 246-290-490 is 
provided in Chapter 8.

Chapter 4.  Cross-Connection Control Regulations for Public Water 
Systems in Washington State 
 
This chapter contains detailed information about the CCC requirements set forth in WAC 246-290-
490.  A copy of the WAC (including CCC-related definitions from WAC 246-290-010) is included 
in Chapter 8. 
 
4.1 
Applicability 
 
All Group A community and non-community public water systems must comply with the CCC 
requirements of WAC 246-290-490. 
 
4.2 
Overview of Regulations 
 
WAC 246-290-490 requires purveyors to develop and implement CCC programs to protect their 
systems from contamination via cross connections.  The specific purpose of a CCC program is to 
protect public health by helping to ensure the quality of water delivered to customers.  This is 
accomplished by protecting the collection, treatment, storage and distribution facilities under the 
control of the purveyor from contamination via cross connections.   
 
Regarding program development, WAC 246-290-490 requires purveyors to include a written 
description of the CCC program in the purveyor’s Water System Plan (required in WAC 246-290-
100) or Small Water System Management Program (required in WAC 246-290-105).  If you are 
unsure whether your system must develop a Water System Plan or Small Water System 
Management Program, consult WAC 246-290-100 and 246-290-105 respectively and/or your DOH 
regional engineer. 
 
In addition to the written program plan, the regulations specifically require purveyors to implement 
their CCC programs.  This is because implementation is the key to protecting the health of 
consumers served by the water system.  Implementation activities include, but are not limited to: 
 
• Hazard surveys;  
 
• Installation of backflow preventers to protect the public water system; 
 
• Establishing a record-keeping system;  
 
• Tracking assembly test reports; and  
 
• Public education.

Page 19 
 
 
Note:  No public health protection is obtained when a system develops but fails to 
implement its cross-connection control program!  The WAC gives purveyors the option to 
implement their cross-connection programs, or any part, directly or by means of a contract with 
another agency or party acceptable to DOH. 
 
Regarding program development and implementation, the general CCC program requirements 
established by WAC 246-290-490: 
 
1. Require purveyors to use good engineering and public health protection practices. 
 
2. Give purveyors the option to use as guidance the most recently published editions of the 
following publications (in addition to DOH publications): 
 
a. Manual of Cross-Connection Control, published by the University of Southern 
California Foundation for Cross-Connection Control and Hydraulic Research; and  
 
b. Cross-Connection Control Manual, Accepted Procedure and Practice, published by 
the Pacific Northwest Section, American Water Works Association. 
 
3. Give purveyors the option to establish CCC program requirements that are more stringent 
than the requirements specified in the WAC. 
 
Under WAC 246-290-490, purveyors must ensure that cross connections between the distribution 
system and a consumer's water system are eliminated or controlled.  In most cases, eliminating cross 
connections is almost impossible.  Thus, control of cross connections is the more common approach 
used to protect public water systems from contamination.  Under the WAC, control of cross 
connections must be accomplished by the installation of approved backflow preventers 
commensurate with the degree of hazard. 
 
The WAC offers purveyors flexibility in CCC program implementation.  Under the WAC, 
purveyors have the option to implement two different types of programs.  Purveyors must 
implement either: 
 
1. Premises Isolation Program, where all backflow prevention assemblies that protect the 
public water system are located at the customer’s meter to isolate the customer’s plumbing 
system from the public water system distribution system; or 
 
2. Combination program, where premises isolation backflow preventers are installed for high 
hazard facilities, and for other types of facilities, backflow preventers are installed for fixture 
protection (or area isolation) within the customer’s premises. 
 
________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems 
March 2004 
Chapter 4 
Page 20 
 
 
Regardless of the type of program implemented, WAC 246-290-490 requires all purveyors to 
comply with the mandatory premises isolation requirements for high hazard facilities of the type 
listed on Table 9 of WAC 246-290-490.  Thus, purveyors that implement combination programs 
must ensure that all high hazard facilities they serve are isolated from the public water system with 
an approved backflow preventer commensurate with the degree of hazard (RPBA or AG).  
 
Where mandatory isolation is not required under the WAC, purveyors may rely on in-premises 
protection in lieu of premises isolation.  Purveyors implementing combination programs often 
choose this option for non-high hazard premises with limited internal cross-connection hazards.  
This option is usually less costly for the customer, since the assemblies used for fixture protection 
are smaller than assemblies used for premises isolation.   
 
In situations where the purveyor relies upon fixture protection to protect the public water system, 
the WAC requires purveyors to ensure that the level of protection provided by the in-premises 
assemblies is equivalent to the level of protection that would be provided by a premises isolation 
assembly.  The WAC specifies a number of conditions that must be met to ensure the equivalent 
protection.  In-premises backflow preventers relied upon by the purveyor to protect the public water 
system must: 
 
• 
Be commensurate with the degree of hazard; 
 
• 
Appear on the list of assemblies approved by DOH; and 
 
• 
Be installed, inspected, tested, maintained, and repaired in accordance with the same 
requirements that premises isolation backflow preventers must meet. 
 
In addition to the above conditions, the WAC requires purveyors to keep the same type of records 
on in-premises backflow preventers as for the premises isolation assemblies.  Last of all, where the 
purveyor relies on in-premises preventers to protect the public water system, the purveyor must 
have access to the consumer’s premises to conduct an initial hazard survey and periodic resurveys.   
 
In summary, under WAC 246-290-490, purveyors are only required to maintain records on the 
assemblies that are relied upon to protect the public water system from contamination.  Thus, for 
connections with premises isolation assemblies, the purveyor must maintain records on the premises 
isolation assembly only.  For connections without premises isolation, the purveyor must maintain 
records on all in-premises assemblies that are relied upon to protect the public water system from 
contamination.

Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems

Chapter 4 
Page 21 
 
 
To protect their systems from contamination, purveyors must take “corrective action” when they 
become aware of unprotected cross connections and/or customers fail to comply with the 
purveyor’s CCC requirements.  Specifically WAC 246-290-490 requires purveyors to take 
appropriate corrective actions when: 
 
1. Cross connection exists and is not controlled commensurate with the degree of hazard; 
and/or 
 
2. Customer fails to comply with the purveyor's requirements for installation, inspection, 
testing, maintenance or repair of approved backflow preventers. 
 
Under the WAC, purveyors have flexibility in what corrective action to take to protect their 
systems from contamination.  Corrective actions may include, but are not limited to the 
purveyor: 
 
1. Denying or discontinuing water service to the non-complying customer;  
 
2. Requiring the customer to install an approved backflow preventer commensurate with the 
degree of hazard; or  
 
3. Installing an approved backflow preventer for premises isolation. 
 
WAC 246-290-490 requires purveyors to coordinate with the Local Administrative Authority 
(e.g., building or plumbing official) on CCC issues.  Similarly, the Uniform Plumbing Code 
amended for Washington requires Local Administrative Authorities to coordinate with purveyors on 
CCC issues.  Coordination can range from information sharing to implementation of joint programs. 
  
Under WAC 246-290-490, purveyors must document the level of coordination with the Local 
Administrative Authorities, including the delineation of CCC responsibilities, in the required written 
CCC program plan described above.  Although recommended, written agreements with the Local 
Administrative Authority are not required under WAC 246-290-490.  As part of the coordination 
efforts, the cross-connection regulations require purveyors to notify the Local Administrative 
Authority when denying or discontinuing water service to a customer. 
 
Backflow results in the unintended return of used water, i.e., water that has left the control of the 
purveyor, into the distribution system.  However, some customers may have heating and/or cooling 
systems that are designed to intentionally return water to the purveyor’s distribution system.  The 
WAC requires purveyors to prohibit the intentional return of used water to their distribution 
systems.  This is because used water has left the control of the purveyor, is of unknown quality 
(may contain contaminants) and may be at a significantly different temperature than the purveyor’s 
water supply.  Customers with these types of heating or cooling systems must dispose of the water 
in some other manner in lieu of returning it to the purveyor’s distribution system.

4.3 
Minimum Elements 
 
To be acceptable to DOH, the purveyor’s CCC program must include the minimum elements 
specified in WAC 246-290-490(3).  There are 10 minimum program elements listed in the WAC. 
 The requirements for each of the minimum elements are provided below.  Guidance for 
implementing each of the minimum elements is provided in Chapter 7 of this manual.   
 
Element 1:  Establish Legal Authority 
 
The purveyor must adopt a local ordinance, resolution, code, bylaw, or other written legal 
instrument that: 
 
1. Establishes the purveyor's legal authority to implement a CCC program; 
 
2. Describes the operating policies and technical provisions of the purveyor's CCC program; 
and 
 
3. Describes the corrective actions used to ensure that consumers comply with the purveyor's 
CCC requirements. 
 
 
 
Guidance for implementing each of these elements 
is provided in Chapter 7. 
 
 
 
Element 2:  Procedures/Schedules for Hazard Evaluations 
 
The purveyor must develop and implement procedures and schedules for evaluating new and 
existing service connections to assess the degree of hazard posed by the consumer's premises to the 
purveyor's distribution system and notify the consumer within a reasonable time frame of the hazard 
evaluation results.  At minimum, the program shall meet the following: 
 
1. For new connections made on or after the effective date of the DOH CCC regulations (i.e., 
April, 1999), procedures shall ensure that an initial evaluation is conducted before service is 
provided; 
 
2. For existing connections made prior to the effective date of the DOH CCC regulations 
(April, 1999), procedures shall ensure that an initial evaluation is conducted in accordance 
with a schedule acceptable to DOH; and 
 
________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems 
March 2004 
Chapter 4 
Page 23 
 
 
3. For all service connections, once an initial evaluation has been conducted, procedures shall 
ensure that periodic re-evaluations are conducted in accordance with a schedule acceptable 
to DOH and whenever there is a change in the use of the premises. 
 
Element 3:  Procedures/Schedules to Eliminate/Control Cross Connections 
 
The purveyor must develop and implement procedures and schedules to ensure that: 
 
1. Cross connections are eliminated whenever possible; 
 
2. Cross connections are controlled by installation of approved backflow preventers 
commensurate with the degree of hazard (when the cross connections can’t be eliminated); 
and 
 
3. Approved backflow preventers are installed in accordance with the requirements of WAC 
246-290-490(6). 
 
Element 4:  Provide Qualified Personnel 
 
The purveyor must ensure that personnel, including at least one person certified as a CCS, are 
provided to develop and implement the CCC program. 
 
Element 5:  Procedures/Schedules for Backflow Preventer Inspection and Testing 
 
The purveyor must develop and implement procedures to ensure that approved backflow preventers

Chapter 5. Reasons for Cross-Connection Control Programs 
 
5.1 
Health Aspects 
 
The first and foremost reason for developing and implementing a CCC program is to protect the 
health of consumers served by the public water system.  This is accomplished by preventing 
contamination of the public water system via cross connections.   
 
The purveyor of a public water system has the responsibility to deliver water to its consumers that 
meets all health standards in the Safe Drinking Water Act and the Washington State Drinking Water 
Regulations for Group A systems (Chapter 246-290 WAC).  The water should also be desirable 
from an aesthetic standpoint to reduce the likelihood of consumers turning to an unapproved water 
supply. 
 
Both the drinking water regulations (Chapter 246-290 WAC) and the DOH Water System Design 
Standards contain many requirements that help ensure a safe water supply for consumers served by 
public water systems.  These requirements include: 
 
• 
Source protection requirements (watershed control, wellhead protection); 
 
• 
Treatment design and performance standards (filtration, chlorination); 
 
• 
Distribution system design and construction (covered reservoirs, pressure standards); and 
  
• 
Proper operations (certified personnel, water quality monitoring, cross-connection control). 
 
The greatest health risk to consumers served by public water systems lies in the introduction of a 
contaminant into the public water system.  By design, the water distribution system is an efficient 
means of transporting drinking water to consumers served by the system.  However, the distribution 
system can also become the conduit for the spread of a contaminant to a large population.   
 
Once introduced into the distribution system, a contaminant can move as a “slug.”  This type of 
situation may result in extremely high concentrations in the drinking water.  In other situations, the 
contaminant may become diluted quickly.  If this occurs, lower concentrations of the contaminant 
will be present in the drinking water.  Without extensive knowledge of flows in a distribution 
system, such as those provided by a hydraulic modeling program, purveyors will have a difficult 
time predicting what will happen once a contaminant enters the water distribution system.

There are three categories of contaminants of importance to purveyors from a CCC standpoint.  
These are: 
 
1. Microbiological contaminants; 
 
2. Chemical contaminants; and 
 
3. Physical contaminants. 
 
The following sections discuss the various types of contaminants of concern and their effects on the 
health of consumers and other aspects of a water system.  Figure 3 illustrates the three hazard types 
and provides examples of each.

Types Of Hazard 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5.1.1 Microbiological Contaminants 
 
In cross-connection control, waterborne diseases are the primary public health concern (e.g., 
cholera, typhoid, giardiasis, and cryptosporidiosis).  Microbiological organisms that may cause 
waterborne disease include:  bacteria, viruses, protozoa, and parasitic helminths (worms).  
 
The risk of a waterborne disease transmitted through the public water supply is a major concern 
because of the: 
 
• 
Large population that may be exposed to the disease in a short timeframe; 
 
• 
Inability to immediately detect contamination (in fact, the first indicator may be the outbreak 
of disease); and  
 
________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems 
March 2004 
Chapter 5 
Page 28 
 
 
• 
Difficulty in tracing the contaminant source (e.g., Giardia cysts may enter the distribution 
system from a reservoir or through a cross connection with an auxiliary supply). 
 
Contributing to the problem of assessing the relative risk to public health of a microbiological 
contaminant is the issue of infectious dose.  The severity of the health effect experienced by an 
individual consuming drinking water containing a disease-causing microorganism varies by the: 
 
1. Type of organism; 
 
2. Quantity ingested; and   
 
3. Strength of the person's immune system.   
 
Individuals with underdeveloped or weakened immune systems, such as infants, the elderly, and 
persons receiving treatment for cancer, are more vulnerable to waterborne diseases than persons 
with fully functioning immune systems. 
 
All microbiological contaminants in drinking water are not necessarily disease-causing organisms.  
However, their presence in the public water distribution system may be an indirect concern to the 
purveyor.  For example, any coliform bacteria detected through the purveyor's monitoring program 
will require mitigation measures.  These measures include re-sampling and possible further action 
such as flushing, disinfection and issuance of a boil water advisory.  In addition, some 
microbiological contaminants may cause taste and odor problems or cause an increased chlorine 
demand.   
 
In assessing the problem of bacteria entering the distribution system, the following system-specific 
issues should be considered (at a minimum): 
 
1. Source water quality.  The quality of the source water, if poor, may enhance bacterial 
growth and re-growth in the distribution system.  For example, sources with high levels of 
organics will provide a food source for bacteria that may enter the distribution system due to 
a backflow incident.  Other quality concerns include water with high turbidity, sulfide 
bacteria, iron and manganese, etc., that provide a biofilm (slime) or biomass (sediment) in 
water mains to harbor bacteria.  
 
2. Condition of distribution system piping.  The condition of distribution system piping, if 
poor, may aid bacterial growth and re-growth in the distribution system.  For example, 
corrosive water may cause tuberculation formation on old, unlined cast iron and steel water 
mains.  The tubercles provide a rough surface that shelters bacteria from chlorine. 
  
________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems 
March 2004 
Chapter 5 
Page 29 
 
 
3. Status of disinfection.  Some purveyors use groundwater as a source of supply and do not 
chlorinate.  The ability and willingness of the purveyor to carry a chlorine residual in the 
distribution system directly impacts bacterial survival and growth within the distribution 
system.  Purveyors that do not routinely chlorinate their systems should be prepared (have 
the necessary means and a plan of action) to apply emergency disinfection to address 
unexpected microbiological contamination. 
 
Concerns about microbiological contamination may be somewhat different from system to system, 
since each system is unique. 
 
5.1.2 Chemical Contaminants 
 
With chemical contaminants, the issue of toxic dose must be considered just like with 
microbiological contaminants.  Every chemical will have some effect on the person being exposed. 
The severity of the health effect experienced by an individual consuming drinking water containing 
a chemical contaminant depends on the type of chemical, amount of chemical in the water and the 
duration of exposure.  With chemical contaminants, the severity of health effects increases with 
dose, i.e., the higher the dose, the more significant the health effects.  Similarly, longer exposures 
result in more significant health effects. 
 
Acute toxic conditions from chemical contaminants are of most concern in cross-connection 
control.  Similar to microbiological contaminants, the health effect to an individual consuming a 
toxic chemical varies by the: 
 
1. Type of chemical; 
 
2. Quantity ingested; and 
 
3. Immune system of the person exposed.   
 
For most people, the ingestion of drinking water with a high copper level will likely cause nausea, 
diarrhea, abdominal pain and/or headache.  However, in a small portion of the population, i.e., those 
individuals with an allergy to copper, the health effects can be far worse (causing death). 
 
Some chemicals may normally have low levels of toxicity to humans.  However, when these 
chemicals are introduced into the water system via cross connections, they may react to form more 
toxic chemicals.  This occurs when the chemicals introduced via backflow combine with the 
chemicals intentionally added by the purveyor to treat the water supply.  Chemical contaminants 
may also react with the piping material in the plumbing or distribution system to leach toxic metals 
into the water.  Other chemicals, such as gasoline, may damage piping materials (e.g., permeation of 
polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipe) and lead to structural failure of the pipe.  
 
________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems 
March 2004 
Chapter 5 
Page 30 
 
 
Some chemical contaminants may adhere strongly to the distribution piping walls and/or plumbing. 
Once a backflow incident has introduced chemicals with this characteristic into the water system, it 
is extremely difficult and/or virtually impossible to completely clean/remove the contaminant from 
the system.  There have been well-documented backflow incidents where the purveyor’s only viable 
remedy was to replace the water main affected by the chemical contaminant. 
 
Concerns about chemical contamination may be somewhat different from system to system, since 
each system is unique. 
 
5.1.3 Physical Hazards 
 
In addition to microbiological and chemical contaminants, purveyors need to be aware that physical 
contaminants can also be introduced into the water supply via cross connections.  Most physical 
hazards are also chemical hazards.  Examples of "pure" physical hazards are compressed air, hot 
water and steam.  Hot water and/or steam, when present in the potable water supply, may result in 
the burning of the skin, eyes, etc., of consumers served by the water system.  
 
Gas is another type of physical hazard.  The public health risks posed by a gas, such as propane, are 
of an entirely different dimension and magnitude compared to the risks posed by hot water and/or 
steam.  In addition to toxic effects, propane gas may cause an explosion.   
 
Thus, when conducting hazard evaluations, purveyors need to be aware of potential physical 
hazards as well as microbiological and chemical hazards.  Just like the other types of cross-
connection hazards, physical hazards may cause injuries and even death in consumers served by the 
system. 
 
5.2 
Multiple Barrier Concept 
 
Protection Afforded Through the Purveyor’s Programs 
 
Public health protection of drinking water emphasizes prevention of contamination and disease.  
This preventative approach is based on the multiple barrier concept to public health protection.  
With this concept, purveyors create multiple barriers or “roadblocks” between disease- causing 
organisms (and other contaminants) and public water system consumers.  With the multiple barrier 
concept, the greater the number of barriers, the greater the public health protection afforded.  Most 
programs implemented by purveyors, including CCC programs, are barriers in the multiple barrier 
concept to public health protection. 
 
The major barriers established for public water systems include: 
 
• 
Protecting Sources of Supply.  Source protection programs are designed to prevent 
microbiological, chemical, and physical contaminants from entering the water supply.  
Source protection is accomplished through implementation of watershed control (surface 
water sources) and/or wellhead protection programs (wells). 
________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems 
March 2004 
Chapter 5 
Page 31 
 
 
• 
Providing Treatment.  Treatment processes, such as filtration and primary disinfection, 
remove, reduce, and/or inactivate contaminants (naturally-occurring and human-related) 
from the raw water.  Treatment is provided to comply with the maximum contaminant level 
(MCL) and treatment technique requirements established by the drinking water regulations. 
 
• 
Secondary Disinfection.  Secondary disinfection is used to maintain a disinfectant residual 
in the distribution system to control microbiological water quality (e.g., bacterial re-growth). 
 
• Storage.  Storage reservoirs provide covered storage and prevent microbiological 
contamination of the treated water through openings in the reservoir (e.g., screened vents, 
hatch seals are provided). 
 
• 
Distribution System Design.  Purveyors comply with the design, installation and material 
standards, and provide minimum operating pressures (e.g., greater than 20 psi during fire 
flow conditions) to prevent contaminants from entering the distribution system.  
 
• 
Cross-Connection Control Programs.  These programs help protect the public water 
system from becoming contaminated via cross connections.  Purveyors require premises 
isolation with approved backflow preventers to prevent contaminants from entering the 
system from high hazard premises. 
 
• 
Water Quality Monitoring.  Monitoring programs provide a means of surveillance of the 
public water system to detect microbiological and/or chemical contaminants in the water 
supply. 
 
• 
Operation by Qualified Personnel.  Purveyors provide DOH-certified treatment plant 
operators, distribution system managers, and CCSs to ensure proper operation of the water 
system (all facilities under control of the purveyor). 
 
• 
Emergency Planning.  Purveyors establish emergency procedures for correcting problems 
detected in water quality monitoring, caused by natural disasters, or created by backflow 
incidents. 
 
Public Health Protection Afforded Through the Plumbing Code and Plumber Certification Law 
 
On the customer's premises, the Uniform Plumbing Code establishes minimum plumbing design, 
installation and operating requirements.  The purpose of the code is to protect the public health, 
safety, and welfare of the occupants of buildings.  The major elements in the plumbing code are: 
 
• 
Supply.  Owners must ensure that there is an adequate supply of piped potable water for the 
plumbing system. 
 
• 
Distribution.  Owners must install approved materials and follow design requirements to 
ensure minimum pressure at fixtures. 
________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems 
March 2004 
Chapter 5 
Page 32 
 
 
 
Without a cross-connection control program, the 
purveyor’s distribution system may become the 
weak link in the multiple barrier approach to 
disease prevention. 
 
• 
Cross-Connection Control.  Owners must provide approved backflow preventers at 
fixtures to prevent contaminants from entering the plumbing system (and drinking water). 
 
In addition to the plumbing code, in Washington, there are also laws and regulations that 
require certified individuals to provide plumbing services within buildings.  According to the 
plumber certification laws and regulations, plumbing is to be installed and repaired by certified 
plumbers (with some exceptions). 
 
The public health protection requirements established by federal and state officials are very 
conservative.  They include a high safety factor for both system design (reliability) and for 
acceptable levels of contaminants.  For example, regulation of chemical contaminants may be 
based on a possible adverse health effect from the long-term (e.g., 30 years) daily consumption 
of two liters of water containing a chemical at a level above the maximum contaminant level 
(MCL). 
 
Many of the federal Safe Drinking Water Act requirements address possible long-term health 
effects of contaminants to consumers.  However, contamination of water distribution systems 
through backflow often results in immediate adverse health effects (illness or death of one or 
more persons) and/or financial losses.  Although cross-connection control is only one of the 
multiple barriers to protect water quality, it is one of the most important barriers to protect the health 
of consumers served by a public water system.  
 
Some governing bodies question the need for purveyors to develop and implement CCC programs.  
Some council and board members feel that CCC programs are a waste of time and money.  
However, cross-connection control programs are an integral barrier in the multiple barrier 
concept to public health protection.  In fact, without a CCC program, the purveyor’s distribution 
system may become the weak link in the multiple barrier approach to disease prevention.   
 
It is illogical for purveyors to spend large amounts of money on capital improvements for source 
water treatment plants, water quality monitoring programs, etc., if the distribution system is 
vulnerable to contamination via cross connections.  Also, for overall risk and liability management, 
the benefits of implementing CCC programs are more favorable for purveyors than incurring costs 
for incident investigation, cleanup, and settlement of claims.

5.3 
Legal Aspects 
 
Once contamination occurs, one or more persons may suffer a loss.  The history of backflow 
incidents reveals that the loss can range from a minor financial loss (e.g., the cost of flushing a 
plumbing system) to the death of one or more persons and a significant financial loss. 
 
Whenever there is a backflow incident, one must assume that litigation will follow.  The 
litigation may be based on a violation of regulations, a tort action, and/or a breach of contract. 
 
 
 
The purveyor's cross-connection control program 
must be designed to reasonably reduce the risk 
of contamination of the public water system and 
should be designed to reduce the purveyor's 
exposure to legal liability. 
 
 
 
In general, the purveyor's liability may flow from the following sources: 
 
• 
Having a statutory/regulatory obligation and failing to follow it (i.e., breach of the law); 
 
• 
Failing to develop a "reasonable" CCC program and/or failing to take follow-up 
enforcement action, once the purveyor has specific knowledge of a hazard (i.e., negligence); 
 
• 
Supplying a customer with contaminated water that causes the customer to suffer a loss 
(e.g., breach of contract/product liability); 
 
• 
Imposing unreasonable requirements on the customer (e.g., requiring an RPBA on all 
services); 
 
• 
Extending a CCC program beyond the purveyor's jurisdiction (e.g., inspecting plumbing and 
enforcing the Uniform Plumbing Code); and 
 
• 
Misrepresenting the actions of the purveyor (i.e., making an implied contract).  
 
The purveyor’s liability may include:  
 
1. Fine or imprisonment for a breach of a statute; and/or 
 
________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems 
March 2004 
Chapter 5 
Page 34 
 
 
2. Payment of monetary damages, including: 
 
a. Court costs; 
 
b. Fees of opposing lawyer; 
 
c. Compensatory damages; and 
 
d. Punitive damages. 
 
The following is an example of a statute pertaining to the purveyor's potential liability (criminal):   
 
 
 
Section RCW 70.54.020 Furnishing Impure Water - Penalty 
 
 
"Every owner, agent, manager, operator or other person having charge of any waterworks 
furnishing water for public use, who shall knowingly permit any act or omit any duty or 
precaution by reason whereof the purity of healthfulness of the water supplied shall become 
impaired, shall be guilty of a gross misdemeanor." [1909 c 249 {291;RRS} 2543]  
 
Other statutes pertain to the purveyor’s liability for payment of penalties for violation of laws or 
rules regulating public water systems.  Under Section RCW 70.119A.030, DOH has statutory 
authority to impose penalties for violations of laws or rules (regulating public water systems) that 
are determined to be a public health emergency.  Under this RCW, purveyors may be penalized up 
to $10,000 per day per violation.   
 
In addition to the public health emergency penalty provision, Section RCW 70.119.040 grants DOH 
general authority to impose penalties for violation of laws or rules regulating public water systems.  
Purveyors may be penalized up to $5,000 per day per violation.  Purveyors should note that when 
monetary damages are computed, every violation is considered a separate offense, and in the case of 
continuing violations, every day’s continuance is a separate and distinct violation. 
 
To reduce the exposure to liability, the purveyor should implement a CCC program that: 
 
1. Complies with regulatory requirements set forth in the drinking water regulations (WAC 
246-290-490); 
 
2. Follows the "standards" of the water industry for the application of backflow assemblies;   
 
3. Includes the installation of approved backflow prevention assemblies;  
 
4. Includes the installation of backflow assemblies and devices in accordance with industry 
standards; 
 
________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems 
March 2004 
Chapter 5 
Page 35 
 
 
5. Includes the testing of backflow assemblies by a method and at a frequency stipulated in 
regulations and recommended by industry standards; 
 
6. Includes the testing of backflow assemblies by certified testers (the certification establishes a 
minimum level of training of the personnel testing assemblies); and 
 
7. Includes procedures for investigating backflow incidents and restoring water quality after an 
incident occurs. 
 
Recognizing that contamination will occur, the purveyor’s exposure to liability can be reduced by 
transferring as much responsibility, and hence, the liability, to others.  This may be done by: 
 
• 
Requiring isolation of the customer's premises by an approved backflow assembly 
commensurate with the degree of hazard, since the greatest exposure to liability for the 
purveyor is in the transmission of a contaminant to its customers; and 
 
• 
Entering into a service contract (written agreement) with the customer to provide water 
service (the agreement spells out the obligations of the purveyor and customer).   
 
 
 
A written "service contract" provides the 
purveyor with the best form of enforcement 
authority, because the customer agrees to the 
standards imposed by the purveyor, and any 
enforcement action by the purveyor may be based 
on the customer's breach of contract. 
 
 
 
In the absence of specific contract terms to limit liability, all parties involved in cross-connection 
control will have some degree of implied responsibility.  Each party is assumed to exercise 
"reasonable" conduct to prevent contamination of the drinking water.  If a case involving damages 
from contamination came before the courts, assessing liability may be reduced to a question of 
whether the defendant: 
 
1. Knew (or ought to have known) about the dangerous condition; and  
 
2. Took reasonable steps within his/her control to prevent contamination of the water system. 
 
All purveyors have a contract with their customers.  Contracts can be in writing (service 
agreements) or implied (nothing in writing).  In either case, the purveyor agrees to provide safe, 
reliable drinking water, and the customer agrees to pay for the water.

As stated previously, the purveyor's jurisdiction ends at the meter.  Thus, the purveyor does not 
have a right to enter upon the customer's property, require a customer to install, test, or maintain a 
BPA, etc., except through the terms and conditions established by the purveyor for providing water 
services, i.e., in the service agreement.  If the agreement is not in writing and/or is not signed by the 
customer, the purveyor and customer may disagree on the obligations of each party.  
 
WAC 246-290-490 establishes the obligation of the purveyor to protect the public water system 
from contamination via cross connections.  However the WAC does not directly or by implication, 
establish an obligation of the purveyor's customer to protect the public water system.  For example, 
where mandatory premises isolation is required under Table 9 of WAC 246-290-490, the purveyor 
is obligated to have an assembly installed on the service.  The WAC does not address who must 
install the assembly.  Thus, if the customer refuses to install the assembly, the purveyor must 
install the assembly and may have to bear the cost associated with the installation.  
 
Examples of standard written service contracts for new and existing customers are provided in 
Appendix D.  The purveyor's attorney should be involved in establishing all forms of contracts. 
 
 
 
It is less expensive for purveyors to pay attorney 
fees for advice on how to avoid a lawsuit than to 
pay fees to defend in a lawsuit.  The purveyor’s 
attorney should develop or approve all customer 
service agreements used by the purveyor.

Chapter 6. Starting a Program 
 
6.1 
Overview 
 
Since 1970, the drinking water regulations in Washington have included the requirement for 
purveyors to develop a CCC program.  Yet, a 1994 DOH survey of water systems indicated that a 
majority of small water systems had not started a program.   More recent data for 2001 indicates that 
even some of the largest community systems in Washington: 
 
• 
Had no written CCC program plans; 
 
• 
Had written programs that did not contain all of the minimum elements required in WAC 
246-290-490(3); and/or  
 
• 
Were not implementing their programs.  
 
It should be noted that the minimum elements currently listed in the CCC regulations first became 
effective in April 1999.  However, the basic elements of a cross-connection program, as outlined in 
water industry reference manuals (e.g., Pacific Northwest Section – American Water Works 
Association Cross-Connection Control Manual), have not changed significantly since the early 
1970s.  
 
Currently, four basic types of programs can be found in Washington.  These are: 
 
1. Combination Programs 
 
These are CCC programs in which the purveyor relies upon both premises isolation 
assemblies and in-premises assemblies to protect the distribution system.  
 
The purveyor requires premises isolation for premises of the type on the DOH mandatory 
list (Table 9 of WAC 246-290-490) and may choose to supplement Table 9 of WAC 246-
290-490 by adding other selected customer categories.  For non-high hazard premises, the 
purveyor relies upon backflow protection at selected points of use (high hazard fixtures) 
within the customer’s premises.  With this type of program, the purveyor makes the risk 
assessment.  Combination programs are the predominant type of program implemented by 
large community water systems in Washington. 
 
2. Premises Isolation Programs 
 
These are CCC programs in which the purveyor relies solely upon premises isolation.   
 
All assemblies protecting the distribution system are located at the meter (or at an 
alternate location acceptable to the purveyor) to isolate the customer’s entire water 
(plumbing) system from the purveyor’s distribution system.   
________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems 
March 2004 
Chapter 6 
Page 39 
 
 
For example, in this type of program, in addition to Table 9 of WAC 246-290-490 
premises, all residential customers with special plumbing and all commercial customers 
are “isolated” at the meter with a DCVA or RPBA. 
 
3. Joint Purveyor and Local Administrative Authority Programs 
 
These are programs that rely upon premises isolation for high-hazard premises (Table 9 of 
WAC 246-290-490 list) and in-premises assemblies and devices at selected points of use for 
other types of premises.  The risk assessment is made through a joint program between the 
purveyor and Local Administrative Authority (local building/plumbing official).   
 
This type of program is most often selected by municipal systems. 
 
4. Non-Community System Programs  
 
In these types of programs, protection from cross connections is afforded by compliance 
with both the Uniform Plumbing Code and WAC 246-290.   
 
This type of program is applicable where the purveyor owns the potable water system from 
the source of supply to the last tap.  An example would be an elementary school supplied by 
its own well, storage tanks, treatment system, etc.   
 
Each type of cross-connection program identified above has significantly different costs, risks, and 
liability implications to the purveyor.  The selection of the type of CCC program to implement is a 
major policy decision for the purveyor.  Senior management, in consultation with the purveyor’s 
attorney, should make the policy decision regarding program type. 
 
6.2 
Program Decisions 
 
The following list identifies the fundamental policy decisions the purveyor needs to make regarding 
the development and implementation of a CCC program.  Once made, the policies may be changed 
in the future.  However, some policy changes are more difficult to make than others, once a program 
has been initially implemented. 
 
The major policy decisions are:  
 
1. Program Type (e.g., premises isolation only);  
 
2. Extent of Coordination (with Local Administrative Authority); 
 
3. Corrective Action; 
 
4. Service Agreements;

5. Location & Ownership of Premises Isolation Assemblies; 
 
6. Cross-Connection Specialist Options; 
 
7. Testing of Assembly Options; and 
 
8. Cost Recovery.  
 
Each of these decisions will be discussed in detail below.  At the end of each section, a table is 
provided for the purveyor to record the policy decision made. 
 
6.2.1 Types of Programs 
 
A CCC program may be based upon either: 
 
• 
Premises isolation protection only; or  
 
• 
A combination of premises isolation and in-premises protection. 
 
Premises isolation means a method of protecting a public water system (i.e., the purveyor's system) 
by installation of DOH-approved AGs or backflow prevention assemblies installed at or near the 
service connection (or alternate location acceptable to the purveyor) to isolate the customer's water 
system from the purveyor's distribution system.  For high hazard premises, premises isolation is 
accomplished by installation of an approved AG or DOH-approved RPBA on the service. 
 
For all CCC program types, mandatory premises isolation is required for high health hazard 
premises (hospitals, medical clinics, etc.).  Table 9 of WAC 246-290-490 lists a number of 
categories of premises where an AG or RPBA is required for premises isolation.  It should be noted 
that the high-hazard premises table in the WAC is not all-inclusive, and other types of premises 
considered to pose a high health hazard also require mandatory isolation with an AG or RPBA.  
Examples of other high hazard premises would include:  airline manufacturing plants, paper mills, 
and military bases.  Table 2 is a copy of the high-hazard premises list from the WAC. 
 
If the customer's property use corresponds to the risk assessment for the category (e.g., medical 
clinic), premises isolation is mandatory.  The only exception is where a customer's business 
practices and activities don’t match the category, i.e., the business name or description is 
misleading. For example, a “medical clinic” may only include psychologists.  The health hazard 
posed by an office of psychologists is not the same as a typical medical clinic with physicians, 
laboratories doing blood work, cultures, providing diagnostic services such as x-rays, etc.  In cases 
where the customer’s business practices aren’t consistent with the hazards normally associated with 
that category of business, the purveyor may grant an exception to mandatory premises isolation.

Under WAC 246-290-490, the purveyor has an obligation to protect the public water system from 
contamination.  The purveyor's customers and the Local Administrative Authority (plumbing 
inspector/ health inspector) have the obligation to prevent contamination of the potable water 
system within the property lines of the customer’s premises. 
 
When establishing a cross-connection control program, the purveyor must first determine 
what level of overall risk and potential liability is acceptable.  Whenever the purveyor relies on 
in-premises backflow preventers, the purveyor accepts increased risk and liability over premises 
isolation due to: 
 
• 
The potential for the plumbing system to be changed by the customer without the purveyor’s 
knowledge and/or approval of the Local Administrative Authority; and 
 
• 
The potential for the customer to fail to test, maintain, and repair the backflow preventers 
the purveyor relies on to protect the public water system.  
 
Purveyors should consider all customers served by the public water system to pose a health risk for 
contamination of the water distribution system.  The health risk increases with the complexity of the 
customer's plumbing system, uses of water (i.e., on-site activities, processes), etc. 
 
No plumbing system should be considered free of cross connections.  However, for many plumbing 
systems (e.g., residential homes), with the normal cross-connection protection afforded through 
compliance with the Uniform Plumbing Code, the risk of contamination to the purveyor’s 
distribution system is typically relatively low.   
 
Premises Isolation Programs 
 
For a premises isolation program, an assessment must be made of the degree of hazard posed by 
the customer to the public water system.  Based on this assessment, if the degree of hazard is such 
that the purveyor believes premises isolation is needed, an approved backflow prevention assembly 
commensurate with the degree of hazard must be installed on the service connection.   
 
A periodic re-evaluation of customers must be conducted to confirm that the premises isolation 
decision initially made is still valid.  If not, the appropriate backflow assembly must be installed on 
the service.  This could be an installation where no assembly was previously required or an upgrade 
to an RPBA from a previously required DCVA (for a change in the customer's water use). 
 
The minimum premises isolation program would consist of: 
 
1. Identifying all customers of the high health hazard type such as those categories listed in 
Table 9 of WAC 246-290-490; and  
 
2. Ensuring the installation of the required RPBA or AG.  
 
________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems 
March 2004 
Chapter 6 
Page 43 
 
 
The minimum premises isolation program offers the purveyor the minimum level of public health 
protection and liability management.  For this reason, a premises isolation program normally 
includes an expanded list of categories requiring premises isolation.  
 
An expanded list of premises isolation categories may be based upon a customer category system of 
classification for assessing health risk.  For example, a DCVA may be required as the minimum 
premises isolation for all shopping malls.  The purveyor's risk assessment then reduces to 
determining if there are any categories of tenants (e.g., dental or medical clinic) in the shopping mall 
that require the premises isolation requirement to be increased to an RPBA (e.g., the mall could 
include a medical clinic).  
 
When considering additions to Table 9 of WAC 246-290-490, purveyors need to be aware that the 
expanded list does not need to be limited to shopping malls.  It could also include all commercial 
customers.  Purveyors could define commercial customers as all customers other than single family 
and duplex residential customers.  Under this approach, all tall buildings, apartments, etc., would be 
included in a general risk category requiring at least a DCVA for premises isolation.   
 
Combination Programs (Reliance on Premises Isolation and In-Premises Assemblies) 
 
In a combination program, the purveyor may rely on in-premises backflow assemblies (at the 
plumbing fixture) for all non high-hazard connections (i.e., where premises isolation is not 
mandated).  The need to assess the degree of hazard posed by the customer on the distribution 
system does not change.  However, the purveyor must determine what individual plumbing hazards 
(fixtures) must be isolated with approved backflow assemblies to provide protection (equivalent to 
premises isolation) for the distribution system.  
 
Part of the in-premises risk assessment should include the potential for plumbing to be changed 
without the purveyor's knowledge.  For example, strip malls with frequent changes in tenants pose 
an increased risk to the public water system.  For example, a clothing retail store could be replaced 
by a camera store with a photo lab without the purveyor's knowledge.  This would increase the risk 
to the purveyor's system.  The purveyor would need to conduct relatively frequent re-surveys of the 
mall to ensure that new cross connections are detected, or add the mall to the supplemental list of 
customers requiring premises isolation. 
 
Part of the overall hazard assessment should also include an assessment of the complexity of the 
building’s plumbing.  As the complexity of the piping increases, the risk of not identifying a cross 
connection increases.  
 
________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems 
March 2004 
Chapter 6 
Page 44 
 
 
Tall buildings or buildings built on a hill above the street (water main elevation) also increase the 
risk of backflow into the purveyor's system from backpressure.  For example, a small drop in the 
purveyor's system pressure may allow backflow to occur.  For these reasons, WAC 246-290-490 
gives purveyors the authority to require premises isolation on premises that have characteristics 
such as: 
 
1. Complex plumbing arrangements or plumbing potentially subject to frequent changes that 
make it impractical to assess whether cross-connection hazards exist; 
 
2. A repeat history of cross connections being established or reestablished; or 
 
3. Cross-connection hazards that are unavoidable or not correctable, such as, but not limited to 
tall buildings. 
 
It should be noted that the in-premises protection provided by the customer in accordance with the 
Uniform Plumbing Code may not be commensurate with the purveyor's assessed degree of hazard.  
This is often the case with old buildings.  Once the customer complies with the Uniform Plumbing 
Code in effect at the time of construction, the customer is “vested.”  The Local Administrative 
Authority can’t require changes/upgrades (e.g., addition of an RPBA) to the existing plumbing 
system, unless the building is significantly remodeled.  Thus, the Uniform Plumbing Code basically 
“grandfathers” the plumbing systems of existing buildings, and their owners are essentially exempt 
from requirements imposed by later versions of the Uniform Plumbing Code. 
 
The purveyor can’t require the customer to make plumbing changes, since enforcement of the 
Uniform Plumbing Code falls under the jurisdiction of the Local Administrative Authority.  
However, the purveyor may offer the customer the option to voluntarily make a plumbing change 
(e.g., install a backflow assembly at a fixture) in lieu of installing a larger, more expensive backflow 
assembly on the service.  The advantages to the customer are: 
 
• 
Possibly lower cost of installation (two 3/4-inch assemblies within a building may cost less 
than a one 1-inch assembly located outside the premises in a vault or above ground 
enclosure); and 
 
• 
Greater health protection for the occupants of the building, since the assembly on the service 
only protects the neighboring customers served by the public water system and not the 
occupants of the building. 
 
The disadvantage to the customer is that the cost of testing and maintaining multiple in-premises 
assemblies may be greater than the cost associated with the single-premises isolation assembly.  
Thus, the customer's long-term testing and maintenance costs for the in-premises backflow 
assemblies may outweigh the initial savings in purchase price and installation costs.

WAC 246-290-490 requires the purveyor to protect the 
distribution system from contamination via cross 
connections. 
 
If the customer doesn’t agree to install a premises isolation 
assembly or equivalent in-premises protection at the 
fixture, the purveyor must install a premises isolation 
assembly on the customer’s service. 
 
 
 
The above sections have discussed two major types of cross-connection programs that purveyors 
can implement to comply with WAC 246-290-490.  Table 3 (below) summarizes the major 
advantages and disadvantages of a premises isolation program vs. a combination program.

6.2.2 Extent of Coordination 
 
WAC 246-290-490 requires purveyors to coordinate with the Local Administrative Authority on 
CCC matters.  Similarly, the Uniform Plumbing Code (as amended for Washington) requires the 
Local Administrative Authority to coordinate with the purveyor on CCC matters.  The level of 
coordination with the Local Administrative Authority may vary.  Coordination options include: 
 
• 
A simple exchange of information (minimum effort); 
 
• 
Interacting (cooperating) with the Local Administrative Authority; or 
 
• 
Operating a combined (joint) purveyor/Local Authority program. 
 
Each of these will be discussed in more detail below. 
 
Exchange of Information Program 
 
For an exchange of information level of coordination, the purveyor should:  
 
1. Notify the Local Administrative Authority (local building official/plumbing inspector) of the 
purveyor's CCC program type (e.g., premises isolation) and policies;  
 
2. Request to be notified by the Local Administrative Authority of all permits for new 
premises and for permits for plumbing changes to existing premises served by the public 
water system; and  
 
3. Notify the Local Administrative Authority of any enforcement action in which water service 
is discontinued and of any backflow incidents known by the purveyor to have contaminated 
the public water system or the customer’s plumbing system.  
 
Note:  Purveyors that initially select the information exchange option can always upgrade the level 
of coordination to an interaction type of coordination in the future.   
 
 
 
WAC 246-290-490 does not require purveyors to enter into 
written agreements with Local Administrative Authorities. 
  
However, written agreements are strongly recommended 
for purveyors who decide to implement joint programs. 
 
 
 
________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems 
March 2004 
Chapter 6 
Page 47 
 
 
The level of coordination must be described in the purveyor's written CCC program plan.  A sample 
program plan is provided in Appendix A. 
 
Interaction Level of Coordination 
 
For an interaction level of coordination (cooperation) with the Local Administrative Authority, the 
purveyor may: 
 
• 
Conduct joint surveys/inspections of the customer's premises; and 
 
• 
Share assembly location and testing information. 
 
An interaction level of coordination is only feasible where the Local Administrative Authority’s: 
 
• 
Staff is knowledgeable about/has expertise in cross-connection control; and  
 
• 
Staff resources are adequate to participate. 
 
Combined/Joint Program Level of Coordination 
 
Purveyors that wish to implement a combined/joint program with the Local Administrative 
Authority should establish: 
 
• 
Which agency (purveyor vs. Local Administrative Authority) will be in overall charge (take 
the lead) of the joint CCC program;  
 
• 
With the Local Administrative Authority, a written agreement that clearly delineates the 
authority and responsibility of each agency with regards to cross-connection control; and 
 
• 
A list of the tasks to be performed by each agency (i.e., the purveyor and Local 
Administrative Authority).  For example, the purveyor agrees to maintain the database of all 
assemblies (i.e., premises isolation assemblies and fixture protection assemblies) and their 
test results, etc.  The Local Administrative Authority conducts all plan reviews. 
 
 
 
Combined (joint) programs work best in 
situations where both the purveyor and Local 
Administrative Authority fall under the same 
governmental entity (i.e., city or town). 
 
 
 
________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems

Page 48 
 
 
In joint programs, it is common for purveyors to delegate responsibilities to the Local 
Administrative Authority.  Similarly, in joint programs, purveyors often accept responsibilities from 
the Local Administrative Authority.  In both cases, these responsibilities are often not within the 
jurisdiction of the purveyor or the Local Administrative Authority respectively.  Special care should 
be taken to consider the purveyor’s potential liability when the written agreement is drafted. 
 
Table 4 shows the recommended extent of coordination based on system size and/or situation.

Practical only where Local

Administrative Authority fall

same governmental entity (i.e., 
city or town). 
 
 
Written Agreements  
 
Although not required in the WAC, purveyors wanting to implement joint programs are encouraged 
to develop written agreements with their Local Administrative Authorities. 
 
There are a number of topics that should be considered when the water purveyor and Local 
Administrative Authority develop a written agreement to implement a joint program.  At a 
minimum, the written agreement should: 
 
1. Define the purpose of the joint program; 
 
2. Identify the parties to the agreement;  
 
3. Define terms used in the agreement (e.g., health hazard); 
 
4. Cite the regulations that the combined program is based upon (e.g., WAC 246-290, UPC); 
 
5. Cite the authority (e.g., ordinance or council vote) to enter into a written agreement and 
implement a combined program;  
 
________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems 
March 2004 
Chapter 6 
Page 49 
 
 
6. List the technical references used (e.g., PNWS-AWWA Manual, USC Manual, etc.); 
 
7. Describe the general policy regarding type of program to be implemented (e.g., premises 
isolation per Table 9 of WAC 246-290-490 with in-premises backflow protection for all 
other facilities); 
 
8. Delineate the respective responsibilities of the purveyor and Local Administrative 
Authority; 
 
9. Identify the responsibilities that have been delegated to or by the purveyor and Local 
Administrative Authority respectively; 
 
10. Describe administration procedures; 
 
11. Designate the entity/person ultimately responsible for overall program supervision (i.e., who 
has the lead, the purveyor or the Local Administrative Authority); 
 
12. Provide detailed operating procedures for: 
 
a. New construction plan review;  
 
b. Authorization for connection of new service; 
 
c. Conducting initial and periodic hazard assessments (surveys); and 
 
d. Communicating with customers. 
 
13. Include procedures for responding to: 
 
a. General water quality complaints; 
 
b. Health-related complaints; and 
 
c. Backflow incident investigations. 
 
14. Describe enforcement procedures for: 
 
a. Addressing Uniform Plumbing Code violations; and 
 
b.  Ensuring compliance with WAC 246-290-490. 
 
15. Identify certified backflow assembly tester (BAT) and CCS requirements;  
 
16. Include procedures for record-keeping and notifying customers for testing, etc.; 
________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems

Page 50 
 
 
17. Include procedures for meeting all of DOH reporting requirements; 
 
18. Contain provisions for amending and/or canceling the written agreement; and 
 
19. Delineate responsibilities for various program costs, cost recovery and transfer of funds 
between the purveyor and the Local Administrative Authority. 
 
 
 
The requirements of a joint program must be 
consistent with the cross-connection control 
requirements of the individual purveyor and Local 
Administrative Authorities.

6.2.3 Relationship to Customer 
 
Another major policy decision for the purveyor is how to formalize the business relationship 
between the purveyor and the customers.  This applies to more than the CCC program issues.  
Whether the purveyor is a private individual, a homeowner’s association or a level of government 
(e.g., water district), good business practices should be followed.  
 
Service agreements are one tool that purveyors can use to formalize the business relationship with 
their customers.  The purpose of a service agreement is to make clear to the customer the:  
 
• 
Legally binding conditions of service; and  
 
• 
Remedy afforded to the purveyor for the customer's breach of contract.   
 
________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems 
March 2004 
Chapter 6 
Page 51 
 
 
At a minimum, a service agreement should: 
 
1. Be in writing and signed by the customer or authorized agent of the customer; 
 
2. Be short, but explicit (in that the customer agrees to the service policy of the purveyor 
including the CCC requirements);  
 
3. Clearly state the corrective action the purveyor will take, when the customer fails to comply 
with the agreement; and 
 
4. Include by attachment the purveyor's written service policy and standards. 
 
Every customer obtains water service by agreement.  The agreement may be verbal or written.  
Initially the agreement (contract) may be in the form of the customer requesting to purchase a water 
service connection, his payment of the connection fee, and the purveyor installing the service and 
meter.  Thereafter, the agreement may continue in the form of the customer's payment of the water 
bill.   
 
At the time of customer's application for service, the purveyor had a policy (terms) for providing 
service.  The terms may have been limited to the customer's payment of a monthly bill.  Any 
detailed policy (contract conditions) may not have been communicated to the customer.  The policy 
may not have expressly covered cross connections. 
 
At the time of the application for service, or subsequently, the purveyor may:  
 
• 
Review the customer's plumbing plans and/or conduct a cross-connection survey to assess 
the hazard posed to the purveyor's system; 
 
• 
Request, as a result of the hazard assessment from the plan review and/or survey, the 
installation of premises isolation or in-premises backflow assemblies to protect the water 
distribution system; or 
 
• 
Accept the protection afforded by existing backflow preventers.  
 
If the purveyor chose not to conduct a plan review and/or hazard survey, by default, the purveyor 
accepted the protection afforded by the existing backflow preventers (e.g., provided under the 
Uniform Plumbing Code). 
 
Historically, when requesting a customer to install backflow preventer, purveyors commonly:  
 
• 
Notified the customer in writing of the results of a CCC plan review and/or survey;  
 
• 
Specified the required backflow preventers; and 
 
________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems 
March 2004 
Chapter 6 
Page 52 
 
 
• 
Notified the customer of the requirement for testing upon installation and thereafter 
annually, etc.   
 
This written request to comply with the purveyor's conditions for service was accepted by the 
customer through the act of installing the backflow preventers.  
 
The purveyor then relied upon the customer's installation, testing, maintenance, and repair of the in-
premises or premises isolation approved backflow preventers and other in-premises backflow 
devices to protect the public water system.  This agreement between the purveyor and customer was 
reaffirmed each year with the request to the customer to have the approved assemblies tested by a 
DOH-certified BAT. 
 
The customer may not have been informed of the purveyor's service policy to:  
 
1. Discontinue water service, if the customer failed to comply with the requirement for testing, 
maintenance, etc., (unless the customer is issued a second notice);  
 
2. Require the customer to install a backflow preventer for premises isolation on the service 
pipe; or 
 
3. Install a backflow preventer for premises isolation on the customer’s service line, if the 
customer failed to do so when requested by the purveyors. 
 
If the above scenario is currently applicable to the system, it is recommended that the purveyor 
request that existing customers sign a written service agreement.  If the purveyor chooses not to 
pursue this independently, the first opportunity to require the customer to sign a service agreement 
should be taken advantage of.  The opportunity may arise with: 
 
1. Request for a new or additional connection; 
 
2. Change in ownership of premises; and/or 
 
3. Change of water use on the premises (e.g., through building expansion, change from 
residential to commercial customer category, etc.). 
 
Unless the service agreement is recorded with the title to the property, the new owner of a building 
is normally not aware of the terms of the service agreement with the purveyor.  The purveyor needs 
to reaffirm this information with the "new customer.”

Chapter 6 
Page 53 
 
 
For existing customers without service agreements, the purveyor may incorporate the written 
service agreement into the notice to the customer to test assemblies or submit a hazard survey.  The 
letter could include the following statements: 
 
• 
In the past, the purveyor requested the installation of one or more backflow assemblies 
within the customer's premises to protect the water distribution system; 
  
• 
By the customer's compliance with the purveyor’s request, the purveyor agreed not to 
require the installation of a backflow assembly on the service; 
 
• 
This benefits the customer by providing protection for both the customer's plumbing system 
(and family) and the water distribution system; 
 
• 
To continue with this arrangement, the customer must have the assemblies tested by a DOH-
certified BAT and maintained, repaired, or replaced as needed to assure performance; 
 
• 
By completing and returning the attached assembly test report form, the customer agrees to 
continue the agreement to provide in-premises protection (rather than have the purveyor 
install an assembly on the customer’s water service and invoice the customer for the 
installation cost, annual maintenance cost); and 
 
• 
The customer may chose to install an assembly on his service pipe in lieu of the in-premises 
assemblies; however, such installation will not relieve the customer of his responsibility to 
comply with the requirements of the Uniform Plumbing Code enforced by the Local 
Administrative Authority. 
 
The letter and accompanying assembly test form will likely document the initial agreement now 
forgotten by the customer, lost by the purveyor, etc.  Sample written service agreements are 
included in Appendix D. 
 
 
 
All agreements should be prepared by or 
approved as to form by the purveyor's attorney. 
 
 
 
Table 5 summarizes the major advantages and disadvantages of having written service agreements.

6.2.4 Enforcement of Corrective Actions [Element 1] 
 
Per WAC 246-290-490 (3), when establishing authority to implement a CCC program, purveyors 
must describe the corrective action used to ensure that consumers comply with the purveyor’s CCC 
requirements.  For reliance on in-premises assemblies and/or premises isolation assemblies owned 
by the customer, the purveyor must make provisions for corrective action to be taken if the 
customer: 
 
1. Fails to test or maintain the assemblies; or  
 
2. Makes a change to the plumbing system that necessitates the installation of additional 
assemblies and/or different types of assemblies.  
 
Prior to April 1999, the cross-connection regulations included the following requirement: 
 
"When an existing cross connection poses a potential health or system hazard, the purveyor 
shall shut off water service to the premises, until the cross connection had been eliminated or 
controlled by the installation of a proper backflow prevention assembly." 
________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems 
March 2004 
Chapter 6 
Page 55 
 
 
The current WAC (effective April, 1999) states: 
 
“The purveyor shall take appropriate corrective action within its authority if: 
 
1. A cross connection exists that is not controlled commensurate to the degree of hazard 
assessed by the purveyor; or 
 
2. A consumer fails to comply with the purveyor's requirements regarding the 
installation, inspection, testing, maintenance, or repair of an approved backflow 
preventer required by this chapter.” 
 
The current WAC continues with the following: 
 
“The purveyor's corrective action may include, but is not limited to: 
 
1. Denying or discontinuing water service to a consumer's premises until the cross-
connection hazard is eliminated or controlled to the satisfaction of the purveyor; 
 
2. Requiring the consumer to install an approved backflow preventer for premises isolation 
commensurate with the degree of hazard; or 
 
3. The purveyor installing an approved backflow preventer for premises isolation 
commensurate with the degree of hazard." 
 
 
 
WAC 246-290-490 states that a purveyor denying or 
discontinuing water service to a customer's premises for 
"corrective action" shall notify the Local Administrative 
Authority (not Washington State Department Of 
Health) prior to taking action, except in the event of an 
emergency. 
 
 
 
 
The failure of a customer to comply with purveyor's requirement for inspection, testing, etc., may 
constitute a potential health hazard, but not an actual health hazard.  A backflow assembly that fails 
the annual test may continue to stop backflow.  However, it may do so with less of a safety factor.  
 
The purveyor has the right to discontinue water service to a customer to protect the water 
distribution system.  However, the unreasonable exercise of this right may expose the purveyor to 
liability.  The shut off of a water service may cause: 
 
1. A significant financial loss to the customer; 
________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems 
March 2004 
Chapter 6 
Page 56 
 
 
2. Backsiphonage conditions that may result in a backflow incident within the customer's 
premises; and 
 
3. A public health hazard to employees and/or residents of the premises (e.g., apartment 
building) from a backflow incident; the lack of water supply for domestic use, fire sprinkler 
systems, kidney dialysis, etc; and the lack of operating sanitary facilities (e.g., toilets). 
 
As a corrective action, if the purveyor shuts off water service to a customer, based on an assessment 
of health risk, the purveyor has the burden of proof that the actions were reasonable.  There are 
certain situations, i.e., public health emergencies, where the shut-off of water to a specific 
connection is needed to protect the public water system from contamination.  Examples would 
include unprotected cross connections to sewage and when a backflow incident is occurring or has 
just occurred. 
 
For situations other than the public health emergencies cited above, rather than face the 
burden of proof, the purveyor may wish to take an alternate corrective action, i.e., installing a 
backflow assembly on the service.  Alternatively, the purveyor may wish to establish with the 
customer service agreements (contracts) that provide a legal protection for corrective action.  
 
 
 
The purveyor's service policy should include 
provisions for recovering all of the purveyor's costs 
associated with the corrective action. 
 
 
 
Table 6 summarizes the advantages and disadvantages of the two main corrective action options 
available to purveyors.  Many purveyors include both types of corrective actions in their programs, 
but limit the use of water shut-off to emergency type situations.

themselves, or to have the customer install and own the assembly. 
 
 
Purveyors may use the following table to document their decisions regarding enforcement of their 
CCC programs.  As discussed above, purveyors can include both types of corrective actions in their 
written program plans and identify the one that will be the most commonly used means of enforcing 
the program (i.e., purveyor installed backflow preventer).

6.2.5 Initial Assessment and Periodic Re-Assessment of Hazard [Element 2] 
 
WAC 246-290-490 requires the purveyor to ensure that a CCS: 
 
• 
Assesses the degree of hazard posed by the consumer’s water system upon the purveyor’s 
distribution system; and  
 
• 
Determines the appropriate method of backflow protection.

Chapter 6 
Page 58 
 
 
Thus, after the basic foundation of the program has been accomplished, the implementation of an 
on-going CCC program starts with the assessment of the level of hazard posed by various 
connections served by the system.  More than any other aspect of a CCC program, the training, 
expertise and experience of a DOH-certified CCS is called upon to properly accomplish this task.  
 
The initial assessment of a service connection or premises refers to either the: 
 
1. Assessment conducted prior to service being initiated for a new service connection; or 
 
2. First time an assessment is performed for an existing service connection.   
 
After the initial assessment, the CCC regulations require periodic re-assessment of the service 
connection to evaluate the appropriateness of the existing level of cross-connection protection. 
 
To comply with these regulatory requirements, the following options are available to the purveyor: 
 
1. The purveyor's certified CCS (on staff or contractor) makes the initial assessment of degree 
of hazard and periodic re-evaluations; or 
 
2. Each customer is required to hire a private CCS (contractor) to conduct the hazard survey 
and submit a report to the purveyor. 
 
Option 2 offers the major advantage to the purveyor of transferring the cost of the initial evaluation 
and re-evaluation of commercial customers (and other customers with complex plumbing) from the 
purveyor to the customer. 
 
With Option 2, the purveyor's certified CCS should review the hazard evaluation report submitted 
by the customer's CCS.  The purveyor's CCS review may be done as part of the periodic program 
review (e.g., once per year), provided the system’s CCC Program Manager is given general review 
guidelines on reviewing reports from customers.  Table 7 summarizes the advantages and 
disadvantages of the two hazard assessment options.

6.2.6 Location and Ownership of Premises Isolation Assemblies [Element 3] 
 
Element 3 of the cross-connection regulations requires the purveyor to develop and implement 
procedures for ensuring that cross connections are controlled by the installation of approved 
backflow preventers commensurate with the degree of hazard.  Regardless of the type of program 
implemented (premises isolation vs. a combination program), the purveyor must decide on the 
issues of ownership and installation location for all premises isolation backflow preventers.   
 
The general options available to the purveyor are premises isolation backflow preventer owned by 
the: 
 
1. Purveyor and installed with the meter on the public right-of-way (ROW) or in a utility 
easement along side the public ROW; or 
________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems 
March 2004 
Chapter 6 
Page 60 
 
 
2. Customer and installed on the service line on the customer's side of the property line 
either: 
 
a. Immediately downstream of the meter; or 
 
b. Downstream of the meter, before the service line enters the building or in the 
mechanical room where the service line just enters the building, with no connections 
between the meter and the backflow preventer. 
 
Illustrations 4-6 show three ownership/location combinations for premises isolation assemblies. 
 
 
 
Premises isolation is defined as ... "the installation 
of approved AGs or approved backflow 
prevention assemblies at or near the service 
connection (or alternate location acceptable to the 
purveyor) to isolate the consumer's water system 
from the purveyor's distribution system.”

* No connections between the meter and premises isolation assembly, unless the connection is specifically approved 
by the purveyor. 
 
 
Purveyors face an increased risk when they accept a customer-installed premises isolation 
assembly at a location other than immediately downstream of the purveyor's meter (i.e., at the 
property line).  The risk comes from the potential for connections to be made to the customer's 
service pipe without the purveyor's knowledge.  A common "alternate location" is the mechanical 
room of a building where the BPA is protected from freezing.  This may offer a major cost savings 
for the customer over construction of an insulated, heated enclosure for a BPA immediately 
downstream of the meter.  However, with this arrangement, the customer receives the benefit, 
while the purveyor accepts the increased risk. 
 
The major advantage to the purveyor's ownership of premises isolation assemblies is the increase in 
the reliability of the assemblies that protect the public water system.  The increased reliability results 
from the fact that the purveyor purchases, installs, tests, maintains, and repairs the assemblies.  The 
major advantage to the purveyor of the customer owning the assembly is avoiding the responsibility 
(and cost) for purchase, installation, maintenance, repairs, or replacement and the accompanying 
potential liability for assembly failure.  These advantages and disadvantages are summarized in 
Table 8.

6.2.7 Cross-Connection Specialist Options [Element 4] 
 
WAC 246-290-490 (3) requires personnel, including at least one person certified as a cross-
connection specialist (CCS) to be provided to develop and implement the CCC program.  The 
options available to comply with the CCS requirement are: 
 
1. Purveyor's staff member obtains CCS certification; 
 
2. Purveyor contracts with another water utility or agency (e.g., the Local Administrative 
Authority, satellite management agency, etc.) to use the services of their CCS; or 
 
3. Purveyor contracts with an independent CCS to provide services. 
 
RCW 70.119 governs DOH’s certification of CCSs and BATs.  The involvement of a CCS to 
"develop and implement" a program varies with the type of program.  For example, in a premises 
isolation program that follows a policy of requiring backflow assemblies only for customers 
included in Table 9 of WAC 246-290-490 (mandatory list), the need for the services of a CCS 
would be minimal.  Table 9 of this manual summarizes the advantages and disadvantages of the 
three CCS options available to the purveyor.

6.2.8 Assembly Testing Options [Element 5] 
 
WAC 246-290-490(3) requires the purveyor to develop and implement procedures to ensure that 
approved backflow preventers are inspected and/or tested.  Thus, regardless of the type of program 
implemented (premises isolation vs. a combination program), the purveyor must establish a policy 
for the testing of assemblies relied upon by the purveyor to protect the distribution system.  The 
general options are: 
 
1. Purveyor's backflow assembly tester (BAT), on staff or a contractor, tests all assemblies; or 
 
2. Purveyor requires the customer to hire a BAT. 
 
 
 
The purveyor shall ensure that a DOH-certified 
BAT tests approved backflow prevention 
assemblies (relied upon by the purveyor) for 
proper operation. [WAC 246-290-490 (7)] 
 
 
 
Having the purveyor's BAT (staff or contractor) perform the tests has the advantage of: 
 
1. Increased reliability (quality control over testing) and thus, decreased potential liability 
(backflow incident); 
 
2. Less administrative cost for the purveyor (notification letters, quality assurance, etc.); and 
 
3. Good public relations, because the customer is not responsible for the task. 
 
________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems 
March 2004 
Chapter 6 
Page 66 
 
 
Testing by the purveyor's staff or contractor BAT has the disadvantages of the purveyor incurring: 
 
1. Possible liability for an assembly failure; and 
 
2. Increased costs for staff. 
 
In programs where the purveyor requires the customer to hire a BAT, the purveyor should provide 
the customer with a list of local contractor BATs (see Section 7 for details) that have met the 
purveyor’s criteria to test.  Although not currently available, a public listing of certified BATs 
should be available from DOH in the future. 
 
Table 10 summarizes the advantages and disadvantages of the two BAT options available to 
purveyors.

6.2.9 Cost Recovery 
 
The purveyor is required by WAC 246-290-490 to develop and implement a CCC program.  The 
cost of the program should be identified in the purveyor's operating budget.  To reduce and/or 
recover the cost of the CCC program, the purveyor may: 
 
1. Assess the general administrative cost of the cross-connection program to all customers, or 
to one class of customers (e.g., all commercial customers) through use of: 
 
a. Commodity or consumption charges (e.g., $/gallon); 
 
b. Meter charges (e.g., $/month), based on the size of meter; or 
 
c. A supplemental backflow assembly charge (e.g., $/month), based on the size of 
assembly. 
 
2. Require each customer to directly bear the costs of the hazard surveys and costs associated 
with the purchase, installation, testing, and maintenance of any backflow assemblies by 
requiring each customer: 
 
a. With a commercial account, to hire a CCS to conduct the initial and subsequent surveys 
to assess the health hazard;  
 
b. To purchase, install, maintain, repair, and/or replace any backflow assemblies required 
as a result of the hazard survey; and 
 
c. With backflow assemblies to hire a BAT for assembly testing.

6.3 
Programs for Non-Community Systems 
 
Per Chapter 246-290 WAC, there are two types of Group A non-community water systems.  These 
are: 
 
1. Non-transient non-community systems; and  
 
2. Transient non-community systems.   
 
The WAC defines these types of systems as follows: 
 
1. A non-transient non-community system (NTNC) is a public water system that provides 
service opportunity to 25 or more of the same nonresidential people for one hundred 
eighty or more days within a calendar year (e.g., school, motel with more than 25 
employees on site); and 
 
2. A transient non-community system (TNC) is a public water system that serves:  
 
a. 25 or more different people each day for sixty or more days within a calendar year; 
 
b. 25 or more of the same people each day for sixty or more days, but less than one 
hundred eighty days, within a calendar year; or 
 
c. One thousand or more people for two or more consecutive days within a calendar 
year (e.g., county fair). 
 
A common characteristic of many non-community systems is that they occupy a single parcel of 
land under one ownership.  As such, the public water system includes all facilities from the source 
of supply to the tap. 
 
For non-community systems, the jurisdictions of DOH and the Local Administrative Authority 
overlap. Thus, the owner of a non-community system must comply with the requirements of both 
jurisdictions.  In other words, non-community systems must comply with both the drinking water 
regulations (Chapter 246-290 WAC) and the Uniform Plumbing Code.  Where there is a conflict 
between requirements, the system owner must comply with the more stringent of the two 
requirements, or comply with both requirements. 
 
Non-community system purveyors that are developing CCC programs should apply the drinking 
water system regulations to those facilities that are normally operated by a community water 
system.  In other words, the drinking water regulations should be applied to the infrastructure from 
the source of supply to the service connection to the building(s).  The primary focus of the drinking 
water regulations is that the source of supply and the distribution facilities (transmission mains) are 
not contaminated via unprotected cross connections.

Similarly, the Uniform Plumbing Code should be applied to the fixtures within the building(s) and 
any irrigation systems on the premises.  The primary focus of the Uniform Plumbing Code is to 
ensure that the plumbing system (within the building or buildings) doesn’t become contaminated via 
unprotected cross connections.  
 
Depending on the number and type of buildings served, the CCC policy of a non-community system 
may be to provide: 
 
1. Source protection, if a single building or water user is supplied (e.g., provide a DCVA at the 
well house that supplies a restaurant);  
 
2. Area or building isolation (particularly if a Table 9 of WAC 246-290-490 premises is 
served); and/or  
 
3. Equivalent in-building protection through installation of backflow preventers at hazardous 
fixtures per the Uniform Plumbing Code. 
 
An example of a written program plan for a non-community system is provided in Appendix B.

Chapter 7. Implementing a Cross-Connection Control Program 
 
7.1 
General Administration 
 
The general administration tasks for a CCC program are the same for both small and larger public 
water systems.  The primary difference is in the amount of administrative work associated with 
implementation of the program.  For small water systems with primarily residential customers, the 
administration of a CCC program should only result in a small, added workload to the system’s 
existing workload.  For these systems, someone other than a DOH-certified CCS may carry out 
many of the administrative tasks associated with the CCC program. .   
 
7.1.1 Overall Management 
 
WAC 246-290-490(3)(e) states that "personnel, including at least one person certified as a cross-
connection specialist (CCS)..." shall be provided to develop and implement the CCC program.  The 
WAC also states in 246-290-490(2)(c) that the purveyor may implement the CCC program directly 
or by means of a contract with another agency or party acceptable to DOH.  This language was 
specifically included to give small water systems that serve primarily residential customers the 
option to contract out for the services of a CCS.  Options for employing the CCS were discussed in 
Section 6.2.6. 
 
The purveyor should designate one individual, i.e., the CCC Program Manager, to provide 
the overall management of the CCC program.  The purveyor should delegate to the Program 
Manager the authority and responsibility to organize and implement the CCC program.  For larger 
systems, the CCC Program Manager is typically the DOH-certified CCS in responsible charge of 
the CCC program.   
 
Small water system CCC Program Managers must have a general knowledge of cross-connection 
control, but they do not necessarily need to be certified as CCSs.  For small systems, administration 
of the CCC program typically requires only limited, periodic work for the CCS.  Thus, the services 
of a full-time CCS are not likely to be needed by a small water system (nor is full-time involvement 
always practical).   
 
Small water system CCC Program Managers that are not currently certified CCSs should complete 
some CCC training.  This will help them to become more knowledgeable about the public health 
aspects of cross-connection control, the regulatory requirements for public water systems and basic 
industry practices.  This knowledge should help uncertified Program Managers with the day-to-day 
implementation of the CCC program. 
 
Several third party training organizations offer CCC courses in Washington.  These courses range 
from inexpensive one-day Basic CCC classes for Small Water Systems to more expensive, 
weeklong CCS certification classes.  More information is available on training in Appendix F.   
 
________________________________________________________________________________________________

Chapter 7 
Page 75 
 
 
Small system CCC Program Managers interested in pursuing CCS certification should note that 
scholarships might be available.  The CCC Committee of the PNWS-AWWA offers CCS 
scholarships for systems serving 2500 connections or less.  See Appendix F for further information.  
 
For a small water system, the CCC Program Manager may be: 
 
• 
The owner of the system (private system); 
 
• 
An elected representative (water association or district); or 
 
• 
An employee, contract manager, or satellite management agency. 
 
The Cross-Connection Control Program Manager will be responsible for the day-to-day 
contact with customers, the general public, state and local government, etc., on cross-
connection control matters.  To ensure that this contact person is kept well informed, all CCC 
Program administration tasks should be under their supervision.  For example: 
 
• 
All correspondence should be routed through the Program Manager (the Program Manager 
should sign the correspondence or at least receive a copy); and 
 
• 
All plans, plan review reports, cross-connection hazard survey reports, assembly test reports, 
etc., should be routed through the Program Manager. 
 
When technical CCC program issues arise, small water system CCC Program Managers who are 
not certified CCSs should defer to the recommendations and advice of the contract CCS.  Program 
Managers who have concerns about or don’t agree with the contract CCS’s recommendations can 
contact DOH for regulatory interpretation questions and/or seek the advice of another experienced 
CCS.  Non-CCS Program Managers should not over-ride the recommendations of their contract 
CCSs. 
 
7.1.2 Purveyor's Policy Statement/Ordinance 
 
Once developed, the CCC program policy (policy statement, ordinance and/or resolution) should be 
incorporated into the purveyor's system Management and Operations Manual.  Purveyors can 
inform their customers about the CCC program policy by: 
 
• 
Distributing the policy to new customers with the application for water service (e.g., as an 
attachment to the service agreement); and 
 
• 
Including a policy summary statement in the annual Consumer Confidence Report. 
 
 
 
 
________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems 
March 2004 
Chapter 7 
Page 76 
 
 
 
The annual Consumer Confidence Report can be a 
cost-effective tool for public education on the 
purveyor's conditions for service, including the 
customer's obligation to protect the distribution 
system from contamination through cross 
connections. 
   
 
 
7.1.3 Personnel 
 
All water system employees (staff and/or contract manager/operator) should have a general 
knowledge of cross-connection control.  The CCS involved in the development and implementation 
of the program will likely be the most knowledgeable about the principles and practices of cross-
connection control.  However, all other water system staff members, from time-to-time, may be 
involved in CCC issues because: 
 
• 
Customers may ask general questions of office and/or field staff; 
 
• 
Office staff will process the paper work related to the CCC program (survey records, 
correspondence, DOH annual summary report forms, etc.); 
 
• 
Field staff may encounter backflow conditions (e.g., main break causes backsiphonage 
conditions, meter reader may notice meter running backwards) or may need to respond to a 
backflow incident; and  
 
• 
Field staff may spot a new “uncontrolled” (i.e., no backflow preventer) cross connection 
(e.g., customer may have installed a lawn sprinkler system without notifying the purveyor or 
obtaining a plumbing permit from the Local Administrative Authority).   
 
General CCC training for staff may be obtained through: 
 
1. Workshops sponsored and/or provided by DOH or technical associations, such as the Pacific 
Northwest Section - American Water Works Association (PNWS-AWWA), Spokane 
Region Cross-Connection Control Committee (SRC4), the Western Washington Cross-
Connection Prevention Professionals Group (The Group), and the American Backflow 
Prevention Association (ABPA); and 
 
2. Operator training manuals, such as Small Water System Operation and Maintenance, 
prepared by California State University, Sacramento.

Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems 
March 2004 
Chapter 7 
Page 77 
 
 
For the CCS employed by the purveyor (on staff or by contract), specialized training is 
recommended and current CCS certification is required.  The initial specialized training may be 
a three to five day "specialist" course.  The CCS must hold a current Cross-Connection Specialist 
certification issued by DOH.  To be eligible to sit for the CCS exam, an applicant must have a high 
school diploma and have six months experience (not necessarily in cross-connection control) 
working for a public water system.  The Cross-Connection Control Resource Information section in 
Appendix F provides information about training resources and CCS certification courses.   
 
DOH requires contract operators to be certified CCSs and Water Distribution Managers.  To obtain 
a list of contract operators check the DOH Office of Drinking Water website at: 
http://www.doh.wa.gov/ehp/dw 
 
Completion of a three to five-day CCS course and certification by DOH ensures a minimum level of 
knowledge in cross-connection control.  However, CCS certification does not provide any assurance 
of experience or expertise.  When employing a CCS to develop and/or implement the cross-
connection control program (either on staff, inter-agency agreement, or contract CCS), 
purveyors should follow procedures normally used for selecting a contractor or consultant.  
Purveyors should try to get proposals from at least two (preferably three) contract CCSs. 
 
When soliciting proposals from contract CCSs, at a minimum, purveyors should request: 
 
• 
Documentation of current CCS certification, and the date of initial CCS certification; 
 
• 
A resume of applicable training, certification, and work experience with specific emphasis 
on experience in program development and implementation to meet the most recently 
published CCC regulations;   
 
• 
A list of public water systems the CCS is currently under contract with and/or systems they 
have provided CCC program services to within the past five years and a description of the 
services provided to each system; 
 
• 
The names of at least three public water systems the CCS has worked for within the 
previous three to five years (to contact as references); 
 
• 
Information on the scope of services the CCS is willing to provide (the scope should include 
all tasks specified in WAC 246-290-490); and 
 
• 
A sample of the CCS’s written work, i.e., a sample CCC program plan, Annual Summary 
Report (ASR), other report, etc. (to evaluate the quality of their work). 
 
________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems 
March 2004 
Chapter 7 
Page 78 
 
 
Purveyors should carefully check references to obtain information about the quality of service 
provided by the contract cross-connection control specialist.  When checking references 
purveyors should be sure to ask whether any problems were encountered during the contract and 
whether the system would hire the CCS again.  Purveyors should avoid cross-connection control 
specialists who advocate an in-premises protection only strategy, since this approach doesn’t 
provide adequate public health protection and doesn’t comply with the current cross-connection 
control regulations.   
 
It is recommended that purveyors only hire CCSs who: 
 
• 
Are familiar with the intent of the most recently published CCC regulations and any 
revisions being proposed and who work closely with DOH CCC program staff;   
 
• 
Develop complete written program plans (i.e., that comply with all the minimum elements in 
the regulations); 
 
• 
Return purveyor technical assistance phone calls within a reasonable timeframe and during 
business hours; and  
 
• 
Ensure that original CCC records are kept by the water system.   
 
If the feedback from references is positive, purveyors may wish to request a sample contract from 
the CCS.  The contract should clearly identify the specific tasks to be performed by the CCS, the 
timeframe for completion of each task and include a provision for the water system to seek a 
remedy for any work that is unsatisfactory to the purveyor (at no additional cost).  The contract 
should also specify that the written program plan will comply with the requirements of the most 
recently published CCC regulations.  In addition, the contract should specify that all work 
performed by the CCS will be in accordance with the most recently published CCC regulations. 
 
Small systems contracting out the development of a written program are advised to include 
language in the contract that allows them to withhold final payment pending DOH’s review and 
acceptance of the written program.  Final payment should not be made, until DOH has indicated to 
the purveyor that the written CCC program meets the current regulatory requirements and is 
considered acceptable.   
 
Taking the above steps is analogous to an insurance policy for a small system and should help 
prevent a small system from being taken advantage of by unscrupulous CCSs.  DOH is aware of 
one small system in Washington that paid $15,000 to a contract CCS for development of a written 
CCC program plan and other services.  Shortly after the system made the final payment, DOH sent 
out notices that the new regulations had been adopted.  The program developed for the small system 
didn’t begin to comply with the new regulations.  The contract only specified that the program 
would meet the regulations currently in effect, so the system had no recourse.

In this case, the CCS under contract never told the purveyor that the CCC regulations were 
undergoing extensive revision.  Yet, DOH had notified all CCSs in Washington of the upcoming 
changes and invited them to participate in the regulation revisions process.  The CCS also did not 
inform the purveyor that the new regulations specified the minimum elements of a written program. 
 If, prior to making final payment, the small system purveyor had contacted DOH and asked for an 
informal review of the program developed by the contract CCS, this unfortunate situation might 
have been avoided. 
 
Small water systems might want to consider contracting with a cross-connection control 
specialist who also is a certified backflow assembly tester (i.e., BAT).  Although not required, 
the additional certification would be advantageous to the system, since the BAT could test all 
purveyor-owned assemblies.   
 
 
 
For most small systems, a cross-connection control 
specialist (CCS) is needed for a relatively small 
number of hours of work.  Thus, the hourly fee 
should not be a major factor in selecting a CCS. 
Instead, purveyors should select a CCS based 
upon training, experience, and past 
performance. 
 
 
 
WAC 246-290-490 specifies a number of program tasks that must be performed by a DOH-certified 
CCS.  These tasks include: 
 
1. Development and implementation of the CCC program; 
 
2. Hazard assessments and determination of the appropriate backflow protection; 
 
3. Granting of exceptions to the mandatory premises isolation requirements and completion of 
forms to document the reason for granting the exception; 
 
4. Inspection of backflow preventer installations to ensure that backflow protection provided is 
commensurate with the degree of hazard; 
 
5. Inspection of AG installations for compliance with the AG definition; and 
 
6. Inspection of backflow assemblies for correct installation and approval status.

Although not currently required, it is recommended that the purveyor’s CCS also complete and sign 
the ASR forms.  For small water systems with a CCS under contract, if completion of the forms is 
not within the scope of work provided by the CCS, at a minimum the CCS should: 
 
• 
Provide the CCC Program Manager with the information and inventory data needed to 
complete the ASR forms; 
 
• 
Review the forms for accuracy; and  
 
• 
Sign them on behalf of the water system. 
 
Table 13 provides an example of the typical tasks and division of responsibilities between the 
Program Manager and the CCS for a small water system.

7.1.4 Water Service Agreements 
 
The types of water service agreements and their respective benefits are discussed in Section 6.2.2.  
Whatever the form of service agreement, the Program Manager and CCS should be involved in the: 
 
• 
Development of the water service agreement; and 
 
• 
Administration of the agreement (e.g., enforcement actions). 
 
For new customers, the Program Manager should ensure that the customer signs an application for 
water service (i.e., the service agreement).   
 
For existing customers, two options are available.  The Program Manager may either: 
 
1. Request that the customer sign an agreement; or 
 
2. Reaffirm the terms of service by asking the customer to sign an agreement as a condition of 
retaining his existing backflow prevention assemblies for fixture protection in lieu of  
installing premises isolation assemblies.  
 
Appendix D includes copies of standard service agreements for new and existing customers. 
 
7.1.5 Backflow Assembly Installation Standards  
 
Per WAC 246-290-490, all backflow prevention assemblies that protect the public water system 
from contamination must be approved by DOH.  In addition, the WAC requires these assemblies to 
be installed in a manner that will facilitate their proper operation, maintenance, inspection, and in-
line testing.  Assemblies must also be installed in compliance with safety regulations and all 
applicable building and plumbing code regulations.   
 
 
 
The purveyor is responsible for ensuring that backflow 
preventer installations comply with safety regulations, 
codes, etc., for the backflow preventers it owns. 
 
 
 
These requirements were established, because an improper installation decreases the assembly’s 
reliability of preventing backflow.  This is due to the fact that: 
 
• 
An unsafe or inaccessible location reduces the likelihood of an assembly being inspected, 
tested and maintained; 
 
________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems 
March 2004 
Chapter 7 
Page 83 
 
 
• 
Improper assembly orientation may prevent proper operation; 
 
• 
Installation in a hazardous environment may allow contaminants to enter the assembly 
through test cocks, relief valve ports, or air inlets, and/or may cause corrosion damage; and 
 
• 
Freezing temperatures or high temperatures may damage the assembly. 
 
 
 
 
Where the purveyor is also part of a Local 
Administrative Authority (town or city), any installation 
problem noted by the purveyor (i.e., water utility) is 
deemed to be known by the plumbing inspector, whether 
or not there is communication between the two 
departments. 
 
 
 
Manufacturers provide recommendations for the proper installation of their assemblies, and it is 
important to consult the manufacturer's instructions prior to the installation of any assembly.  
However, the water purveyor or other approval authorities may have established installation 
requirements that differ from the manufacturer's recommendations.  In fact, the manufacturer's 
recommendations may be in conflict with DOH and/or the purveyor's requirements.  In all cases, 
the more stringent installation requirements of DOH and the water purveyor take precedence 
over the manufacturer’s recommendations.  
 
 
 
The Washington State Department of Health  
Backflow Prevention Assemblies Approved for Installation 
in Washington shows the approved orientation for the 
installation of each approved assembly (e.g., flow upward, 
horizontal, vertical, or alternate orientation) by make, 
model, and size of assembly. 
 
 
 
 
Systems that need to establish installation standards for their program plans can consult technical 
publications, regional CCC groups and/or larger purveyors in their area for detailed assembly 
installation information.  Recommended installation standards are provided in technical publications 
such as the: 
 
• 
Manual of Cross-Connection Control, published by the University of Southern California -  
Foundation for Cross-Connection Control & Hydraulic Research (USC-FCCCHR); and 
________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems 
March 2004 
Chapter 7 
Page 84 
 
 
• 
Cross-Connection Control Manual, Accepted Procedure and Practice, published by the 
Pacific Northwest Section, American Water Works Association. 
 
Most water utilities in Washington with established programs reference the PNWS-AWWA 
publication.   
 
Another source of installation information is the regional CCC groups within Washington.  The 
Western Washington Group has developed brochures showing the installation requirements for each 
type of assembly used for premises isolation.   
 
The purveyor of a small water system may adopt installation standards by referencing: 
 
• 
The above noted manuals;  
 
• 
The standard plans issued by a nearby (large) utility; 
 
• 
The standard plans issued by a regional CCC group in Washington; or 
 
• 
Standard plans issued by the purveyor.  
 
Examples of standard installation drawings are included in Appendix D. 
 
7.2 
Implementation of Program 
 
Program implementation starts with the adoption of CCC policy (ordinance, by-law, or other legal 
instrument).  This is followed by development of a written program plan to carry out the policy and 
to meet the requirements of WAC 246-290-490.  The written description of the program must be 
included in the purveyor's Water System Plan or Small Water System Management Program, 
whichever is applicable. 
 
WAC 246-290-490 (3)(b) sets forth the required elements of the CCC program.  The minimum 
elements are summarized in section 4.3 of this manual.  The major implementation elements are 
discussed in this section. 
 
 
 
The purveyor reduces exposure to liability by 
complying with the cross-connection control 
regulations for Group A systems and following the 
"standards" of the cross-connection control 
industry.

Page 85 
 
 
7.2.1 Schedule of Initial Risk Assessment 
 
The purveyor must establish procedures and schedules for assessing the cross-connection 
hazard (health risk) of all new and existing customers.  The procedure for hazard assessment 
depends on the type of program adopted, i.e., premises isolation versus a combination program that 
also relies on in-premises assemblies.  The discussion on program types was provided in Section 
6.2.1. 
 
New Customers 
 
The hazard assessment for all new connections should have begun in April of 1999.  This was the 
effective date of the new regulations.  According to the WAC, for new customers, the hazard 
assessment must be done before service is provided.  The assessment may be done by: 
 
• 
Category classification (medical clinic);  
 
• 
Customer questionnaire (fire sprinkler system); and/or 
 
• 
CCS plan review and field cross-connection hazard survey. 
 
Existing Customers 
 
For existing customers, the purveyor must prepare a schedule acceptable to DOH for: 
 
• 
The initial hazard assessment; and 
 
• 
Periodic re-assessment.      
 
An absolute deadline has not been established by DOH for completion of the initial hazard 
assessment. 
 
The hazard assessment procedures for new and existing customers are essentially the same.  
However, the hazard assessment schedules for these two categories of customers will differ.  The 
hazard assessment schedule for existing customers is a key element in the purveyor's written 
program.   
 
The assessment schedules directly affect the annual administration and operation costs of the 
purveyor’s CCC program.  The schedules also have a major bearing on the purveyor's exposure to 
the risk of contamination and potential liability for damages from a backflow incident. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems 
March 2004 
Chapter 7 
Page 86 
 
 
 
Hazard assessments should be done on a priority 
basis.  A higher priority should be given to high 
health hazard categories of premises (e.g., 
hospitals, medical clinics, car washes, etc., of the 
type listed on Table 9 of WAC 246-290-490). 
 
 
 
Setting Priorities 
 
All purveyors need to set priorities for hazard assessments, due to limited resources.  However, 
purveyors with combination programs need to even be more careful in prioritizing their hazard 
assessments.  This is because a significantly greater effort is required to survey the non-high hazard 
customer’s premises to determine if backflow preventers at fixtures provide protection 
commensurate with the degree of hazard and equivalent to premises isolation. 
 
For combination programs that rely on premises isolation and in-premises protection, priority for 
hazard assessments should be as follows (listed from high to low priority): 
 
1. High Priority:  Customers of the type listed on Table 9 of WAC 246-290-490 as a high 
health hazard requiring premises isolation by an AG or RPBA (mandatory premises 
isolation); 
 
2. Medium Priority:  Customers included in the purveyor's supplemental list for mandatory 
premises isolation; and  
 
3. Low Priority:  The remaining customers. 
 
Initial Hazard Assessment Schedule 
 
Table 14 lays out a reasonable hazard assessment schedule for a small water system.  The 
timeframes listed under the schedule column start from the initiation of the water system’s CCC 
program.

Purveyor may use their billing records, business license information, and/or the telephone book 
"Yellow Pages" to identify potential commercial, industrial, and other non-single family residential 
customers.  This list can be used to make a rough appraisal of the number of connections in each 
non-residential hazard category.  For small towns and cities, the local business licensing agency is 
often a very good source of information for identifying non-residential customers. 
 
Once the rough appraisal is made, the next step is to determine if a customer actually "fits" the 
hazard category.  The purveyor’s CCS must make final hazard assessment decisions. 
 
Exceptions 
 
As mentioned previously, some customers that initially appear to fall into a high health hazard 
category requiring mandatory premises isolation may actually pose only a moderate or low hazard 
to the public water system.  For example, a building described as a medical clinic may contain only 
psychologists, and thus, would not fall into a high health hazard category requiring premises 
isolation by an RPBA.  However, if a tenant changed to a physician or veterinarian, the building 
would require an RPBA for premises isolation.   
 
Other examples of premises that initially appear to fall into the high hazard category but pose a 
lower hazard are: 
 
• 
A “bottling plant” that only stores the finished product; and 
 
________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems 
March 2004 
Chapter 7 
Page 88 
 
 
• 
A commercial dry cleaners or laundromat that is used only to collect or deliver clothes (i.e., 
the cleaning facility is located elsewhere). 
 
For these type facilities, the purveyor has the policy choice to either: 
 
1. Require premises isolation from the start, based on the potential for a change in tenants/use; 
or  
 
2. Grant an exception to premises isolation and frequently re-assess the hazard to detect a 
change in tenants/use. 
 
Purveyors don’t have to obtain DOH concurrence to grant an exception to mandatory 
premises isolation for a high-hazard category of customer of the type listed in Table 9 of WAC 
246-290-490, where the customer's water use does not ”match” the high-hazard assessment.  
However, the purveyor's CCS must document the justification for waiving premises isolation by 
completing an Exceptions Report Form.  Purveyors must submit Exception Report Forms to DOH 
with the ASR (see Section 7.6).  All exceptions granted by the purveyor to the mandatory premises 
isolation list must be reported to DOH. 
 
Customer Notification 
 
Once the initial hazard assessment is complete, purveyors must notify their customers of the results. 
 The WAC states that the purveyor must notify the customer, within a reasonable timeframe, to 
inform them of the assessment results and the requirements for backflow prevention to protect the 
purveyor's system.  To allow for purveyor flexibility, DOH has not established an absolute 
timeframe for issuing the assessment notification for backflow preventer installation.   
 
However, to better protect public health and for risk and liability management, it is prudent for 
purveyors to notify customers as soon as possible of their: 
 
• 
Hazard assessment results; and  
 
• 
Responsibility to prevent contaminants from entering their potable water systems and the 
purveyor's distribution system. 
 
Table 15 presents a schedule that can be used by a small water system for notifying customers of 
hazard assessment results.  The schedule starts from the date of completion of the hazard 
assessment.

Under Washington Law, it is a gross misdemeanor 
for any owner or operator to knowingly permit, or 
by omission allow, the contamination of a water 
system (see Section 5.3 for RCW wording). 
 
 
 
 
 
7.2.2 Schedule for Periodic Re-Assessment 
 
Per the WAC, the purveyor must periodically re-assess the cross-connection hazard posed by all 
connections served by the system.  However, the purveyor’s reassessment efforts can focus on 
customers other than those with premises isolation AGs or RPBAs, as long as annual test 
reports are satisfactory for the premises isolation backflow preventers.  Customers with 
premises isolation AGs or RPBAs already have installed the maximum backflow protection. 
 
How often should hazard reassessments be done?  The frequency of periodic hazard re-assessments 
should be based on the potential risk the customer poses to the purveyor's water system.  
 
Due to resource limitations, most systems will need to phase the scheduling of hazard re-
assessments.  Customers that pose the greatest risk to the water system (i.e., non-residential 
customers) should have their hazard reassessments scheduled first.  Once the higher risk customers 
have been addressed, assessments for lower risk (i.e., residential) customers can be scheduled. 
________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems 
March 2004 
Chapter 7 
Page 90 
 
 
Priorities (listed from highest to lowest) for scheduling re-assessments should be given to: 
 
1. Non-residential customers: 
 
a. Without premises isolation DCVAs, i.e., where in-premises backflow preventers protect 
the public water system from contamination (e.g., industrial building that is likely to 
have changes in the plumbing); 
 
b. With premises isolation DCVAs, where changes in tenants or plumbing could raise the 
risk to high hazard (e.g., strip malls where a building occupancy could change to include 
a medical clinic); and  
 
2. Residential customers (the water use questionnaire can be used for re-assessments). 
 
Per the WAC, a re-assessment is also required whenever there is a change in the use of the 
premises.  This is because a change in use often results in a change in the hazard posed to the water 
system.  Hazard assessment changes may trigger: 
 
• 
A requirement for a premises isolation backflow preventer, where no preventer was 
previously required or where the purveyor relied on in-premises preventers; or  
 
• 
An upgrade to a more reliable preventer (i.e., DCVA to RPBA), where a less reliable 
preventer was previously required. 
 
Table 16 lays out a reasonable hazard re-assessment schedule for a small water system.  The 
schedule starts from the date of the initial hazard assessment.

7.2.3 Schedule for Backflow Prevention Assemblies Installation 
 
Once the initial hazard assessment is complete and the customer has been notified, the WAC states 
that the purveyor shall develop and implement procedures for: 
 
• 
Eliminating cross connections; or  
 
• 
Controlling cross connections by installation of approved backflow preventers 
commensurate with the degree of hazard in situations where cross connections cannot be 
eliminated.  
 
 
 
 
Cross connections are eliminated by removal of points of 
use of water (e.g., plumbing fixtures) or removing sources 
of contaminants (e.g., abandoning a private well according 
to Washington State Department of Ecology 
specifications). 
 
It is not possible to eliminate all cross connections on 
the customer's premises. 
 
 
 
A hazard assessment determines if the customer's cross connections are "controlled" to the 
satisfaction of the purveyor.  If control is not satisfactory, the purveyor must: 
 
1. Install an approved backflow preventer for premises isolation; 
 
2. Get the customer to install an approved backflow preventer for premises isolation; or 
 
3. Get the customer to install in-premises approved backflow preventers (for fixture protection 
or area isolation) that provide equivalent (to premises isolation) protection for the purveyor's 
system. 
 
Whichever is the case, the purveyor must establish a schedule for the installation of the backflow 
preventer(s).  To give flexibility to purveyors, DOH has not established an absolute deadline for the 
installation of backflow preventers once a hazard assessment for an existing customer has been 
done.  However, for public health protection and liability management reasons, backflow 
preventers should be installed as soon as possible after the need for a preventer is identified. 
 
 
 
 
 
________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems 
March 2004 
Chapter 7 
Page 92 
 
 
 
For liability management reasons, it is in the 
purveyor's best interest to have assemblies installed 
as soon as possible. 
 
 
 
The installation of backflow prevention assemblies may be a significant cost to the purveyor and/or 
customer.  For new customers, the cost of a backflow preventer for premises isolation or in-
premises alternatives will constitute a very small amount compared with the overall project budget 
if they are required at the time of construction.  Thus, the requirement for the installation of a BPA 
before service is provided is not an undue burden to the customer.  
 
For existing customers and/or the purveyor, the cost of installing backflow preventers as a retrofit 
may be significant compared with the customer's annual operating budget.  Except where an 
immediate high health hazard has been identified, it is reasonable to work with the customer and to 
allow them enough time to fund the installation of backflow prevention assemblies required by the 
purveyor. 
 
Table 17 provides a schedule that lays out “a reasonable timeframe” for an existing customer of a 
small water system to install a backflow assembly or assemblies.  The timeframes presented start 
from the date the customer was notified of the hazard assessment.

7.2.4 Communication with Customers 
 
The CCC Program Manager should be responsible for all initial communication with customers.  
The initial communication should include: 
 
• 
Notification of the water system’s policy (or change in policy) to establish a CCC program;  
 
• 
Public education materials describing the need for cross-connection control; and 
 
• 
Hazard assessment information, i.e., either the distribution of water use questionnaires or the 
scheduling of a cross-connection hazard survey. 
 
The purveyor's CCS may handle subsequent communication with customers regarding the CCC 
program.  
 
Sample letters, public education materials, and forms are provided in Appendix D.  Additional 
resource materials may be found in the PNWS-AWWA manuals and USC Manual listed in 
Appendix F. 
 
7.2.5 Requirements of Existing Customers 
 
Under WAC 246-290-490, purveyors must protect the public water system from the cross-
connection hazards posed by its customers.  Unless the purveyor has specific knowledge to the 
contrary, for existing customers, the purveyor must assume that: 
 
• 
All customers were in compliance with the plumbing code in effect at the time the certificate 
of occupancy was issued for their premises; and  
 
• 
No significant plumbing changes have occurred (i.e., that would require a new plumbing 
permit) since the certificate was issued. 
 
The Local Administrative Authority, i.e., plumbing inspector, has jurisdiction over matters of public 
health and safety within the property lines of the customer’s premises.  The customer's plumbing is 
considered to be "reasonably" safe, if it complies with the health-related parts of the Uniform 
Plumbing Code.  However, unlike the drinking water regulations, the customer is "vested" with 
respect to the Uniform Plumbing Code. 
 
Thus, Local Administrative Authorities can’t require a change in the customer’s plumbing system to 
bring the plumbing into compliance with the most recently adopted code, unless the Local 
Administrative Authority has specific knowledge of a health or safety hazard.  Also, the Local 
Administrative Authority doesn’t have the authority to make random plumbing inspections, once 
certificates of occupancy have been issued.   
________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems 
March 2004 
Chapter 7 
Page 96 
 
 
Despite efforts by the Local Administrative Authorities to ensure compliance with the Uniform 
Plumbing Code, experience has shown that some customers make plumbing changes without the 
proper permits and thus, their plumbing doesn’t comply with the plumbing code in effect at the time 
of construction.   Also, the plumbing of many other existing customer premises may not comply 
with the most recently adopted plumbing code. 
 
If the purveyor requires a backflow preventer for premises isolation (i.e., purveyor installs or 
requires customer to install), prior to installation:  
 
1. The purveyor should notify the customer: 
 
a. Of the reason for the backflow preventer installation (e.g., general policy for a meter 
check; to isolate an existing lawn irrigation system); and 
 
b. That the backflow preventer will prevent thermal expansion from being relieved 
through the distribution main, and thus, the customer should ensure that his plumbing 
has adequate safety protection (e.g., pressure temperature relief valve on the hot water 
tank, and an expansion tank). 
 
2. The purveyor should notify the Local Administrative Authority (LAA) (plumbing 
inspector) of any backflow preventer and/or meter check to be installed by the purveyor, 
so that the LAA may inspect the customer's premises for thermal expansion protection.  
 
7.2.6 Cross Connections in Purveyor's System 
 
An essential component of the purveyor's CCC program is to provide protection from cross 
connections at purveyor-owned facilities.  These facilities include: 
 
• 
Office and maintenance buildings; 
 
• 
Water treatment plants; and 
 
• 
Water distribution mains. 
 
Office and maintenance facilities should be evaluated using the same criteria used for assessing a 
customer's premises.  For facilities constructed on parcels of land owned by the purveyor, the 
purveyor must also comply with the Uniform Plumbing Code requirements enforced by the Local 
Administrative Authority (plumbing inspector).  
 
If the purveyor is an agency of a city, town, or county, municipal facilities such as water and sewage 
treatment plants, parks, community centers, government buildings, and shops must also be 
evaluated for cross-connection control. 
________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems 
March 2004 
Chapter 7 
Page 97 
 
 
There are a number of common cross connections typically found in purveyor-owned facilities.  
These may include cross connections in: 
 
1. Water treatment plant including: 
 
a. The discharge of filter backwash and rinse water to waste; 
 
b. Potable water connections to chemical injectors or pumps; 
 
c. Sampling lines that connect a meter to both raw and treated (finished) water; 
 
d. By-pass connections between raw and treated water storage; 
 
e. Surface washers; 
 
f. Hydraulically operated filter effluent valves; 
 
g. Chlorinators connected to both raw and treated water; and 
 
h. Common walls between finished and unfinished water. 
 
2. Distribution system including: 
 
a. Air release and vacuum valves; 
 
b. Temporary connections for new water main disinfection; 
 
c. Fire hydrants, standpipes when used for: 
 
i. Filling tanker trucks; or 
 
ii. Flushing water mains or sewers. 
 
The following manuals list typical distribution system hazards and the recommended backflow 
prevention:

Pacific Northwest Section, American Water Works Association (PNWS-AWWA); and

For liability and public relations reasons, it is 
prudent for purveyors to provide cross-connection 
control for all purveyor-owned facilities, before 
asking customers to spend money for backflow 
preventer installation and testing. 
 
 
 
7.2.7 Common Cross Connections Associated with Small Water Systems 
 
Small water systems often serve many premises (and water uses) that pose cross-connection hazards 
to the public water system.  Some of these hazards are listed on Table 9 of WAC 246-290-490(4).  
However, other specific hazards encountered in the system may not be listed.   
 
Many large water systems have developed extensive lists of hazardous premises they serve and 
identify the required backflow protection.  Tables 19 and 20 list some hazards that may be served by 
small water systems and the required/recommended backflow protection for each type of hazard or 
premises.  For ease of use, the tables are divided into residential and commercial hazards 
respectively.

7.3 
Mandatory Premises Isolation 
 
WAC 246-290-490 lists categories of high hazard premises that require mandatory isolation.  Most 
CCC technical publications also list customers requiring mandatory premises isolation.  These lists 
were developed based on assessments of severe or very high degrees of hazard.  The assessments 
are often confirmed by reports of well-documented backflow incidents.   
 
Between the various technical publications and state regulations, there may be different customer 
categories listed for mandatory premises isolation.  At a minimum, the purveyor must comply 
with the premises isolation requirements of WAC 246-290-490(4).  It should be noted that the 
WAC gives purveyors the option to require premises isolation for connections serving premises not 
identified on Table 9 of WAC 246-290-490.  These include premises such as tall buildings, 
premises with complex plumbing or plumbing subject to frequent changes, and premises with a 
history of cross connections being established. 
 
Some purveyors supplement Table 9 of the WAC by adding other customer categories (usually non-
residential) to their system’s mandatory premises isolation list.  Purveyors can obtain ideas for 
additional categories in technical manuals, such as: 
 
• 
Manual of Cross-Connection Control, published by the University of Southern California -  
Foundation for Cross-Connection Control & Hydraulic Research (USC-FCCCHR); and

Cross-Connection Control Manual, Accepted Procedure and Practice, published by the 
Pacific Northwest Section - American Water Works Association. 
 
7.3.1 Washington State Requirements for Fire Protection Systems 
 
In Washington, the Uniform Plumbing Code requires backflow prevention for all fire protection 
systems, except for flow-through or combination systems for residential services.    
 
A flow-through fire system: 
 
• 
Uses a different piping system from the consumer’s potable water piping; 
 
• 
Is constructed of approved potable water piping and materials to which sprinkler heads are 
attached; and 
 
• 
Ends at a connection to a toilet or other plumbing fixture to prevent the water in the pipe 
from becoming stagnant.   
 
In a combination fire system, the potable water piping and materials serve both the fire sprinkler 
system and the consumer’s potable water system. 
 
WAC 246-290-490 requires the purveyor to ensure that backflow protection consistent with the 
UPC is installed.  The UPC requires minimum protection as follows: 
 
• 
An RPBA or RPDA for fire protection systems with chemical addition or using an 
unapproved auxiliary water supply; and 
 
• 
A DCVA or DCDA for all other fire protection systems. 
 
Purveyors can easily meet this requirement for new services.  Purveyors can stipulate in the service 
agreement (i.e., application for new service) that the customer must comply with the current 
Uniform Plumbing Code before service is provided.  
 
For existing customers, the purveyors may only request compliance from the customer, or install a 
backflow preventer on the service for premises isolation.  By defining "high health cross-connection 
hazard" and specifying the appropriate approved backflow preventer as an AG, RPBA or RPDA, by 
default, a fire protection system requiring a DCVA or DCDA is a "low health cross-connection 
hazard.”  This may undermine the purveyor's enforcement of a DCVA for public health protection 
reasons.  
 
For existing customers, purveyors can require compliance in situations where the customer has a 
change in water use, remodels the premises, etc. 
 
 
________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems 
March 2004 
Chapter 7 
Page 102 
 
 
 
The purveyor is not an enforcement agency for the 
Uniform Plumbing Code. 
 
An existing customer may be "vested" with respect to the 
Uniform Plumbing Code.  If a backflow preventer is not 
currently in place, neither the purveyor nor the Local 
Administrative Authority (plumbing inspector) has 
authority to require compliance with the current UPC. 
 
However, if the customer does not install the required 
backflow prevention assembly, the purveyor must 
install an assembly on the service. 
 
 
 
Table 21 provides guidance for scheduling the installation of backflow preventers on fire sprinkler 
systems for existing customer connections.  The schedule starts from the purveyor’s hazard 
assessment notice to the customers.

Schedule of Backflow

addition and/or auxiliary supply)

The purveyor should notify the Local Fire Marshal 
whenever a backflow preventer is installed on a 
fire service or on a combined fire and domestic 
service, since the added pressure loss through the 
backflow assembly may affect the design of the 
fire system.

7.3.2 Purveyor's Additional Requirements 
 
WAC 246-290-490 establishes minimum requirements for CCC programs.  However, under the 
WAC, water purveyors may develop more stringent program requirements than those of the state 
and/or local levels of government (i.e., the county). 
 
When adding new requirements or making more stringent requirements, it is important for 
purveyors to: 
 
• 
Establish justification for the added requirement (i.e., show that the decision was not 
arbitrary or capricious and that the added requirement can reasonably be met by the 
customer); and 
 
• 
Maintain consistency in their application to customers served by the system. 
 
Justification for additional requirements may be based on: 
 
• Following good engineering and public health practice as outlined in technical 
publications; and 
 
• Adopting a policy to further limit the purveyor's risk and liability (e.g., by requiring 
DCVAs on all commercial customers). 
 
Consistency may require that the purveyor apply the more stringent requirements: 
 
• 
Equally to new and existing customers; and 
 
• 
To similar hazard categories. 
 
7.4 
Requirements for Backflow Assembly Testing 
 
Backflow assemblies are mechanical devices subject to fouling and wear.  History has shown that 
backflow preventers that are not tested periodically will not be maintained or repaired.  Backflow 
preventers that are not maintained or repaired have a much higher likelihood of failure.  Similarly, 
AGs that are not inspected periodically may be by-passed or re-plumbed. 
 
Testing Frequency 
 
Backflow assemblies and AGs used in place of assemblies relied upon by the purveyor to protect 
the public water system must be inspected for proper installation and tested for proper operation.  
WAC 246-290-490 (7)(b) requires inspections and/or testing: 
 
1. At the time of installation; 
 
________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems 
March 2004 
Chapter 7 
Page 104 
 
 
2. Annually after installation (minimum frequency); 
 
3. After a backflow incident; and 
 
4. After an assembly is repaired, reinstalled, or relocated (or an AG is re-plumbed). 
 
Atmospheric vacuum breakers on residential lawn irrigation systems, if relied upon by the 
purveyor to protect the public water system, must also be inspected for proper installation per WAC 
246-290-490 (7)(c): 
 
• 
At the time of installation; 
 
• 
After a backflow incident; and 
 
• 
After repair, reinstallation or relocation. 
 
 
 
Because a test procedure for the AVB has not been 
established, some purveyors require a PVBA or DCVA on 
all lawn irrigation systems, so that all preventers relied 
upon by the purveyor are testable. 
 
A lawn irrigation system for a residential customer poses 
no less a hazard than an irrigation system for a 
commercial customer.   
 
The UPC establishes backflow protection requirements 
for irrigation systems, and as amended for Washington, 
allows an RPBA, PVBA, DCVA, or an AVB for 
backflow protection for irrigation system without 
chemical addition. 
 
 
 
Test Procedures 
 
WAC 246-290-490 requires backflow prevention assemblies (relied upon by the purveyor to protect 
the public water system) to be tested using procedures acceptable to DOH, such as those specified in 
the most recently published edition of the Manual of Cross-Connection Control, published by the 
University of Southern California Foundation for Cross-Connection Control & Hydraulic Research. 
 Copies of the field test procedures are available from DOH on request.

It should be noted that the testing requirements in the most recently published edition of the 
Cross-Connection Control Manual, Accepted Procedure and Practice, published by the Pacific 
Northwest Section, American Water Works Association are more stringent (supplemental tests 
required) than the test procedures specified by USC.  Therefore, it is important that the purveyor 
adopts as a policy and notifies the customer if the more stringent PNWS-AWWA test 
requirements are to be followed.  An example of the supplemental testing requirements of the 
PNWS-AWWA Manual for RPBAs is that the RPBA relief valve tests include a check to verify 
the relief valve will continue to open and discharge water. 
 
 
 
Most small water systems specify the use of the 
standard Washington State Department of Health 
Approved Field Test Procedures. 
 
 
 
 
As discussed in Section 6.2.7, purveyors have the option of testing the assembly (purveyor's 
certified staff or purveyor-contracted certified BAT), or requiring the customer to employ a BAT to 
perform the test and submit a test report to the purveyor.  The purveyor may also elect to make the 
initial test of an assembly, but require the customer to arrange for all subsequent tests. 
 
Testing Notification 
 
Regardless whether the purveyor or assembly owner is responsible for testing, the small water 
system purveyor should schedule the tests of all assemblies that protect the public water system at 
the same time of the year.  This approach makes it easier for the purveyor to administer the testing 
portion of the cross-connection program.  In addition, BATs will often reduce their testing fees 
when they can arrange to test several assemblies in one area.   
 
If the assembly owner is responsible for testing, purveyors should: 
 
1. Notify the customer in writing and allow at least one month from the date of notification for 
the testing to be done and the test report to be returned; 
 
2. Include, in the testing notification letter, a statement affirming the understanding that service 
is provided based on the customer's agreement to test, maintain, and repair the assemblies 
required by the purveyor (if a written service agreement is not in place); 
 
3. Specify the acceptable field testing method (e.g., the DOH field test procedures); 
 
4. Provide a list of local testers (BATs); and 
 
5. Provide a test report form for each assembly owned by the customer. 
________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems 
March 2004 
Chapter 7 
Page 106 
 
 
A public listing of the DOH-certified BATs will be available from DOH sometime in the future.  
 
DOH does not currently require that one “standardized” test report form be used in Washington.  
This approach gives purveyors the flexibility to design their test report forms for ease of data entry 
into their respective CCC databases.  However, all test reports should provide the same basic 
information needed by the purveyor.  It is hoped that the minimum elements of an acceptable test 
report form will be addressed in future CCC-related regulation revisions.   
 
Because the minimum elements of an acceptable test report are not currently specified in the 
drinking water regulations, purveyors must identify test report contents as part of their testing 
quality assurance/quality control program (Element 6 of WAC 246-290-490).  A sample test report 
form is included in Appendix D.  Other sample test report forms are available: 
 
• In technical CCC guidance manuals from PNWS-AWWA and/or USC; 
 
• From national organizations such as the ABPA; and  
 
• From regional CCC groups in Washington, such as SRC4 and “The Group.” 
 
• To obtain test report forms from the above sources, see Appendix F for contact 
information.   
 
• It should be noted that the regional CCC groups in Washington are in the process of 
developing a standardized test report form for voluntary use by their members.  Many 
BATs support the standardized test report form concept since it eliminates the need for 
BATs to keep track of and use different test report forms in different service areas (i.e., a 
different form for each purveyor).   
 
Purveyors may choose to address the requirement for a periodic hazard re-assessment at the same 
time they address assembly testing.  For purveyors that conduct their own hazard re-assessments, a 
water use questionnaire can be included with the testing notice for customers.  Purveyors that rely 
on hazard re-assessments conducted by customer-employed CCSs may include with the assembly 
testing notice: 
 
• 
A notification letter for the customer to employ a certified CCS to re-survey the premises 
(the CCS’s re-assessment should either confirm that the existing assemblies are 
commensurate with the degree of hazard or recommend additional and/or different 
assemblies); and  
 
• 
A list of local CCSs providing contract services. 
 
A list of contract operators who are certified CCSs is available from the DOH website.  Regional 
CCC groups may also maintain lists of experienced CCSs who are willing to contract with small 
water system customers for hazard surveys.  See Appendix F for resource information. 
________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems

Chapter 7 
Page 107 
 
 
It should be noted that the purveyor only has a contract relationship with the customer.  In other 
words, purveyors have no contract relationship with the customer's BAT or CCS.  Thus, all 
purveyor communication about testing and surveys should be with the customer, not with the 
customer’s backflow assembly tester or cross-connection control specialist (third party).   
Purveyors should send the notices for testing directly to their customers.  Both the BAT and the 
customer should sign the completed test report form, and the customer should return the completed 
form to the purveyor.  This approach accomplishes the following: 
 
• 
Establishes a record that the customer was made aware of any deficiencies listed in the 
report form by the BAT; and 
 
• 
Re-affirms, by signature, the customer's agreement to test and maintain the assemblies as a 
condition of service. 
 
Copies of sample testing notification and hazard re-survey letters are included in Appendix D. 
 
The CCC Program Manager should review test and survey forms as soon as possible after they are 
submitted.  For CCC Program Managers that are not certified CCSs, the purveyor's CCS should 
provide guidance on what to look for in the initial review (e.g., the test form is complete, and the 
data shows that the assembly passed the test).  Based on the initial review: 
 
• 
If the test report form is incomplete, the CCC Program Manager should notify the customer 
of the deficiency (and may, as a courtesy, choose to also notify the BAT at the same time); 
 
• 
If the test report form shows that the assembly failed the field test, the CCC Program 
Manager should give written notice to the customer to repair or replace the assembly within 
a specified timeframe (e.g., one month).  This is the start of enforcement procedures.   
 
If the CCC Program Manager has concerns about a test report, the contract CCS should be 
contacted for technical assistance. 
 
Figure 4 shows a typical testing process for a small public water system. 
 
 
 
If the purveyor’s cross-connection control program relies 
upon third party backflow assembly tester or cross-
connection control specialist for hazard surveys, the 
purveyor has a contract relationship with the owner, not 
with the owner’s cross-connection control specialist or 
backflow assembly tester. 
 
All purveyor communication for surveys and tests should 
only be with the building/assembly owner.

Purveyors should consider coordinating their test notices with the test notices issued by the 
Local Administrative Authority (LAA).  Coordination of test notices will benefit the purveyor’s 
customers.  The customer may have assemblies within his premises that are not relied upon by the 
purveyor for the protection of the distribution system.  The cost for testing may be reduced, if the 
customer arranges to have all assemblies on the property (premises isolation and fixture protection) 
tested at one time.  Also, where purveyors rely on in-premises assemblies to protect the public water 
system, the annual test reports required by the purveyor may be used to show compliance with the 
Uniform Plumbing Code.  
 
When coordinating test notices with the test notices issued by the LAA, the purveyor's testing letter 
to the customer should clearly state that the: 
 
• 
Customer is to return test reports to the purveyor only for the assemblies specified;  
 
• 
Other assemblies owned by the customer should be tested to comply with the Uniform 
Plumbing Code; and 
 
• 
If applicable, test reports submitted to the purveyor may also be used to comply with the 
Uniform Plumbing Code testing requirements.  
 
For combined programs (see Section 6.2.2), the coordination may include a provision for the 
purveyor to collect test report forms for all assemblies within the property lines of the customer's 
premises.    
 
Regardless of the level of coordination with the LAA, the purveyor may receive completed test 
reports for assemblies not on the purveyor's list (i.e., not relied upon by the purveyor to protect the 
public water system.  For many purveyors it is preferable for the purveyor just to return the reports 
to the customer, rather than take on the responsibility for forwarding them to the appropriate Local 
Administrative Authority.  This is especially true for purveyors who coordinate with many LAAs.  
When returning the report forms to customers, the purveyor should advise the customer of the 
correct LAA to mail the form to. 
 
Sample notification letters are provided in Appendix D.  Additional samples of letter and forms may 
be found in referenced publications listed in Appendix F. 
 
7.4.1 Approved Backflow Assembly Testers 
 
A DOH-certified backflow assembly tester (BAT) must conduct all field tests of assemblies relied 
upon by the purveyor to protect the water system.  The public listing of certified testers should be 
available from the DOH Office of Drinking Water website in the future.  The website address is: 
http://www.doh.wa.gov/ehp/dw 
________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems 
March 2004 
Chapter 7 
Page 110 
 
 
Purveyors should maintain a list of local certified assembly testers, so that the CCC Program 
Manager: 
 
• 
Can verify the tester's certification status when checking completed test reports; and  
 
• 
May provide the list to customers along with the testing notice. 
 
In addition to DOH BAT certification, purveyors may specify additional conditions that must be 
met by BATs who want to provide testing in the purveyor’s service area.  These conditions may 
specify that the BAT must:  
 
• 
Also be certified as a CCS; 
 
• 
Have a local business license; 
 
• 
Be a registered contractor (issued by Washington State Department of Labor and Industries 
[L&I]); and 
 
• 
Use purveyor-approved testing equipment and show proof of a recent verification of test 
equipment accuracy and calibration (if needed). 
 
The Local Administrative Authority may also enforce minimum qualifications for BATs.  The 
Uniform Plumbing Code amendments in Washington require assemblies to be tested by a DOH-
certified BAT (See WAC 51-46-0603.3.2). 
 
WAC 246-290-490 and the Uniform Plumbing Code (amended for Washington) both require DOH 
BAT certification.  However, purveyors need to be aware that additional certifications and/or 
registrations may be required for persons providing backflow assembly installation, maintenance 
and/or repair services.  As mentioned in Chapter 3, RCW 18.106 (enforced by L&I) establishes 
minimum standards for persons installing, repairing, and/or replacing backflow prevention 
assemblies within buildings.   
 
Under this RCW, only licensed plumbers can install, maintain, repair, and/or replace backflow 
assemblies within buildings.  BATs who also hold a specialty plumber certification from L&I may 
test and repair assemblies within buildings.  In addition, RCW 18.27 establishes the requirements 
for contractor registration, and some BATs may be required to also be registered contractors.  Thus, 
multiple statutes/regulations may apply to persons working on assemblies in the purveyor’s service 
area, depending on where the assemblies are located (within building vs. outside a building), and 
whether services in addition to testing are provided.  Purveyors must check on the certification 
status of BATs to comply with WAC 246-290-490.  However, L&I does not expect purveyors to 
“police” or enforce contractor registration and/or plumber certification requirements.   
 
________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems

Chapter 7 
Page 111 
 
 
Current DOH tester certification is limited to demonstrating a minimum level of knowledge in 
assembly field test procedures and installation requirements.  BAT certification doesn’t certify that 
an individual can properly install and/or repair an assembly.  BATs who hold the specialty plumber 
certification issued by L&I have successfully passed a written exam on assembly repair, in addition 
to the BAT written and hands-on exam.  
 
7.4.2 Quality Assurance Program 
 
WAC 246-290-490 requires purveyors to develop a testing quality assurance/quality control 
program.  This program must:  
 
• 
Document that test reports are submitted by DOH-certified testers; 
 
• 
Document the type of test kit used, serial number, and that the test kit has been verified for 
accuracy within the last year and calibrated if necessary (some test kits can’t be re-
calibrated), 
 
• 
Specify the minimum content of test reports (to be acceptable to the purveyor) and establish 
procedures for test report review; and 
 
• 
Establish a timeframe for completed test reports to be submitted to the purveyor (e.g., within 
10 working days from the date the test was performed). 
 
Most large purveyors maintain much of this tester quality assurance information in their CCC 
Program databases.  Program Managers that have this tester information readily available can more 
effectively and efficiently administer their CCC programs.  For example, some systems enter the 
certification numbers of testers into their CCC databases, so that any test reports submitted by non-
certified testers will automatically be rejected.   
 
To comply with the quality assurance/quality control requirement, purveyors of small systems may 
rely upon information provided by another nearby utility (i.e., larger) that has an established quality 
assurance program.  This could include proof of test kit accuracy verification and calibration and the 
list of approved testers. 
 
Although small water system CCC Program Managers may conduct the initial reviews of test 
reports for completeness, they may not have the training to assess the details in the report.  The test 
report details may show that: 
 
• 
An assembly is wearing out and needs to be repaired or replaced; and  
 
• 
The BAT improperly tested the assembly or falsified the test results. 
 
________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems 
March 2004 
Chapter 7 
Page 112 
 
 
The purveyor's CCS (either on staff or contract) should have the training and experience to 
review test reports for quality assurance purposes.  The reviews should be made at least annually, 
and preferably more often, if previous reviews show problems (e.g., questionable BAT 
performance). 
 
 
 
The purveyor's cross-connection control specialist 
should report any questionable  
backflow assembly tester performance  
to Washington State Department of Health 
Operator Certification Program. 
 
 
 
 
7.5 
Enforcement Procedures 
 
When the purveyor provides good public education material on cross-connection control to 
customers, 99 percent of the customers will voluntarily comply with the purveyor's requirements.  
For the other one percent, from the very start of the CCC program, the purveyor should anticipate 
the need to take some form of corrective or enforcement action against non-complying customers.   
 
Purveyors should be pro-active and establish their enforcement policies before any 
enforcement action is required.  The purveyor's management staff and lawyer should be involved 
in establishing the enforcement policy.  The policy lays out in detail the enforcement procedures to 
be followed by the CCC Program Manager. 
 
The purveyor’s enforcement procedures should address the following: 
 
• 
The number of subsequent notices to be sent (after the initial notice), before the purveyor 
takes an enforcement action; 
 
• 
The time interval between notices; 
 
• 
Use of registered mail for subsequent notices; 
 
• 
The wording of notices (e.g., polite reminder for the second notice, and an ultimatum for the 
final notice); 
 
• 
For in-premises assemblies, when to inform the Local Administrative Authority of the 
problem; 
 
• 
When to notify the purveyor's management, and/or lawyer; 
 
________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems 
March 2004 
Chapter 7 
Page 113 
 
 
• 
An appeal process; and 
 
• 
Which enforcement procedure to take for the various assessed “degrees of hazard.” 
 
Figure 5 shows an example enforcement procedure.  Examples of enforcement notices are included 
in Appendix D. 
 
Purveyors need to be aware that the failure of an assembly to pass the initial or annual field test 
doesn’t establish for certain that the assembly will fail to prevent backflow.  Failure may only 
indicate that the desired level of reliability is not present.  Thus, when laying out enforcement 
procedures, purveyors should make the enforcement action appropriate for the hazard posed.  DOH 
has developed guidance regarding when purveyors should shut-off water and when they should use 
other enforcement tools to protect the public water supply. 
 
 
 
Shutting off the supply of water to a customer may cause 
a health hazard and/or a financial loss.   
Purveyors should have enforcement tools other than 
water shut-off also available, such as installing or testing 
the backflow preventer and billing the customer.

7.6 
Record-Keeping and Reporting Requirements 
 
Purveyors should keep all original records (correspondence, plans, etc.) in the water system's 
files.  If contractors (i.e., CCSs) are used, the contractors should give the original records to the 
water system and retain photocopies of the records in their own files. 
 
 
 
If a contract cross-connection control specialist  
or manager's employment ceases,  
the purveyor may have difficulty recovering files 
and records that are retained at any location other 
than the purveyor's office files. 
  
Original records should always be kept in the 
water system’s files. 
 
 
 
7.6.1 Record of Risk Assessment 
 
For each customer, the purveyor shall maintain a record of the initial risk assessment and 
subsequent re-assessments, in the form of a completed: 
 
• 
Water Use Questionnaire (i.e., for residential customers); and/or 
 
• 
Cross-Connection Survey Report. 
 
Samples of each may be found in Appendix D, Sample Forms. 
 
For risk management reasons, the purveyor should retain both the initial form, plus the latest re-
assessment, because the forms: 
 
• 
Document that the purveyor has complied with the DOH requirement to evaluate new and 
existing customers to assess the degree of hazard; 
 
• 
Provide a historical perspective that may be needed by a new CCS, Program Manager, or 
supervisor; 
 
• 
Contain a signed statement from the customer or customer's CCS about his water use, and/or 
assessed degree of hazard; and 
 
• 
Contain information useful for investigating a backflow incident.  
________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems 
March 2004 
Chapter 7 
Page 116 
 
 
For each connection where the purveyor requires a backflow preventer to protect the public water 
system, records should be kept indicating the assessed hazard level of the connection and the 
required backflow preventer. 
 
7.6.2 Inventory of Backflow Preventers 
 
It is critical for purveyors to keep accurate records on backflow preventers that protect the public 
water system from contamination.  These may include both purveyor-owned assemblies and 
customer-owned assemblies.   
 
WAC 246-290-490 (3)(j)(ii) lists the minimum backflow preventer inventory information that 
purveyors must keep on file.  For each customer where an approved BPA or AG is required by the 
purveyor to protect its distribution system, and for approved backflow preventers installed at 
purveyor- owned facilities, the inventory should include {per WAC 246-290-490(3), Element 9}: 
 
• 
Information on the exact location of the backflow preventer or AG (adequate details to find 
the backflow preventers);  
 
• 
Description of hazard isolated (either the category of premises such as a medical clinic or 
the fixture such as a boiler);  
 
• 
Type, size, make, model, serial number and installation date of backflow assembly, or AG 
details including installation date; and 
 
• 
Size, make, model and installation date of AVBs used on irrigation systems. 
 
7.6.3 Inventory of Backflow Preventer Test/Inspection Reports 
 
For each assembly field test or AG inspection, the test report inventory information should include 
at a minimum: 
 
• 
The name and certification number of the BAT performing each test or inspection; 
 
• 
Test results (pass/fail and actual readings) or inspection results; and 
 
• 
Repair/re-plumbing history. 
 
Appendix D contains a sample file record form that includes the inventory of backflow preventers 
and test reports. 
________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems

Page 117 
 
 
7.6.4 Correspondence 
 
The purveyor should maintain copies of all correspondence with customers for a period of at least 
five years.  The purveyor should also maintain, as a permanent record, the: 
 
• 
Most current service agreement with each customer; and  
 
• 
Notification to the customer to install a backflow preventer(s) to protect the public water 
system from contamination. 
 
All correspondence with DOH and the Local Administrative Authority should be maintained for at 
least five years. 
 
7.6.5 Washington State Department of Health Reporting Requirements 
 
Purveyors are required to meet the reporting requirements of WAC 246-290-490.  These 
requirements include completing the CCC Annual Summary Report (ASR) forms and making them 
available to DOH on request. 
 
Copies of the current forms (there are three) are available from DOH.  However, DOH will send 
purveyors the forms and ask them to submit to DOH information on their CCC programs.  These 
forms comprise the ASR forms.  The forms provide a means for purveyors to report on the: 
 
• 
Status of their written program plans;  
 
• 
Progress of their implementation activities; and 
 
• 
Exceptions they have granted and the justifications for granting of the exemptions.    
 
An example set of ASR forms for 2002 is provided in Appendix E. 
 
7.6.6 Spreadsheets and Computer Database Software 
 
For the number of assemblies expected in most small water systems, the records of the inventory of 
assemblies, test reports, local BATs, etc., can be kept on a spreadsheet, either manually (i.e., on 
paper), or using commercially available computer software (such as Excel or Access).   
 
Proprietary computer database software programs are also available.  These have been developed 
specifically to aid purveyors in the management of their CCC programs.  A list of some of the 
companies supplying computer software for managing CCC programs is provided in Appendix F.  
Regardless of the type of record-keeping system used, the system must be able to provide the data to 
answer the questions that appear on the CCC ASR forms.

7.6.7 Backflow Incident Reports 
 
Element 9 of WAC 246-290-490 requires purveyors to maintain CCC records and complete annual 
summary reports and backflow incident reports.  Backflow incidents are to be reported on a form 
acceptable to DOH.  A sample backflow incident report form developed by the PNWS-AWWA 
CCC Committee is provided in Appendix D.  Additional supporting information, photos, laboratory 
analyses, etc., may be attached to the report.   
 
The PNWS-AWWA form is currently acceptable to DOH.  In the future, DOH may develop a 
Backflow Incident Report Form that is designed for computer entry and future web-based 
submission.   
 
If a backflow incident occurs, check with DOH to ensure that your system has the most current form 
to report the details of the incident. 
 
7.7 
Public Education 
 
Public education is a key part of the purveyor's CCC program.  Through public education programs, 
purveyors inform customers of: 
 
• 
The public health impacts of potential cross-connection hazards;  
 
• 
Their responsibility to protect the public water system from contamination; 
 
• 
The purveyor's requirement to comply with the DOH regulations; and 
 
• 
The purveyor's policies (i.e., conditions of service).  
 
7.7.1 Type of Effort 
 
Element 8 of WAC 246-290-490 requires purveyors to educate their customers on cross-connection 
control.  For small water systems, the recommended public education methods are: 
 
• 
Water bill inserts (brochures); 
 
• 
Consumer Confidence Reports; 
 
• 
For new customers, information on service policy distributed with application for service; 
and 
 
• 
Reliance on general public education materials developed by regional and national technical 
groups (PNWS-AWWA CCC Committee, SRC4, The Group, and other technical 
organizations) and/or by large utilities.

Appendix F lists organizations that have public education brochures available for use by small water 
systems.  Due to limited resources, small water systems are encouraged to use the education 
materials (brochures, postcards, newsletters, etc.) already developed by other organizations and/or 
systems.  There is no need for a small water system to “re-invent the wheel,” when so many 
excellent public education materials on cross-connection control are readily available. 
 
7.7.2 Frequency  
 
The annual Consumer Confidence Report provides an excellent means for purveyors to routinely 
inform their customers about the status of their CCC programs.  The purveyor’s Consumer 
Confidence Report should include a brief statement about the: 
 
• 
Purveyor's operation of a CCC program; and  
 
• 
Customer's responsibility to protect his/her plumbing system and the purveyor's distribution 
system from contamination via cross connections. 
 
Education brochures should be distributed every two to three years.  
 
7.8 
Backflow Incident Response Plan  
 
A purveyor’s failure to properly respond to a backflow incident may: 
 
• 
Significantly increase the number of persons exposed to a health hazard; 
 
• 
Increase the purveyor's effort (cost) to contain a contaminant and clean the contaminant 
from the distribution system; and  
 
• 
Expose the purveyor to increased liability from a claim for punitive damages for negligence. 
 
 
 
Don't wait until a backflow incident occurs to 
develop an incident response plan! 
 
 
 
Appendix C contains a sample Backflow Incident Response Plan for a small water system. 
 
Purveyors should consult with the Local Administrative Authorities and Local Health jurisdiction 
when developing the response plan to identify communication lines, responsibilities, etc.

Special Requirements for Reclaimed or Greywater 
 
Reclaimed Water 
 
Reclaimed water systems use wastewater treatment effluent that has been adequately and reliably 
treated, so that it is suitable for a direct beneficial use or a controlled use that would not otherwise 
occur.  The utilization of reclaimed water is referred to as water reuse.   
 
A dual distribution system supplies two grades of water to the same service area.  One of the 
supplies is potable water (acceptable for drinking), and the other supply is non-potable (not 
acceptable for drinking).  Reclaimed wastewater is typically categorized into four classes of quality 
(A through D).   The classes range from the highest quality (A) for use in irrigation of open access 
areas (golf courses, parks, schoolyard), non-restricted recreational impoundments, toilet flushing in 
commercial and industrial buildings, and fire protection systems to the lowest quality (D) for use in 
irrigation of non-food crops (e.g., tree farms) and sewer flushing. 
 
All classes of reclaimed water shall be considered a high health hazard.  This is because the 
degree of treatment of reclaimed water is far less than the minimum requirements for the production 
of potable water.  Even the Class A reclaimed water criteria allow water that could contain 
pathogens (disease-causing organisms). 
 
Due to the high health hazard, Department of Ecology standards prohibit direct connections 
between reclaimed water systems and potable water systems.  Further details can be found in the 
Water Reclamation and Reuse Standards jointly published by the Department of Ecology and 
Washington State Department of Health (Ecology publication number 97-23). 
 
For connections where both reclaimed water and potable water are provided on the 
customer's premises, per Table 9 of WAC 246-290-490, premises isolation at the water meter 
by an approved AG or reduced-pressure backflow assembly is required.  The requirement is 
based on the assessment of a high health hazard of the reclaimed water, and the high probability that 
a connection could be made between the potable and non-potable systems (e.g., in the event of the 
disruption of the reclaimed water supply).  Dual distribution systems operated by the water utility 
shall adhere to the requirement for premises isolation. 
 
Where the customer uses potable water to supplement a reclaimed water system, the water must be 
supplied through an approved AG inspected by a certified BAT at least annually. 
 
Greywater 
 
A greywater system uses the effluent from untreated household wastewater that hasn’t come into 
contact with toilet waste or food processing waste.  Greywater includes wastewater from bathtubs, 
showers, bathroom sinks, clothes washing machines and laundry tubs.  Greywater excludes 
wastewater from kitchen sinks and dishwashers.

A greywater system may supply water for underground landscape irrigation.  The system typically 
contains one or more holding tanks, an underground distribution system connected to perforated 
irrigation pipe, an overflow gravity drain to the sewer or septic system, and a pump.  
 
All greywater systems shall be considered a high health hazard.  This is due to the potential for 
the greywater to contain human pathogens, even if connections to toilets are excluded (e.g., bath 
water may contain human fecal material).   
 
Premises isolation at the water meter by an approved AG or reduced-pressure backflow assembly is 
required.  The requirement is based on the: 
 
• 
Assessment of a high health hazard of the greywater; and  
 
• 
Probability that a connection could be made between the potable water system and 
greywater system to supplement the greywater supply.

This section contains Washington State Department of Health drinking water regulations relating 
to cross-connection control, WAC 246-290-490.  Section 490 has been extracted from WAC 
246-290, the Group A Drinking Water Regulations.  These regulations first became effective in 
April 1999.  To enhance the completeness of the regulations, definitions, abbreviations and 
acronyms relating to cross connections which have been extracted from WAC 246-290-010. 
 
8.2.1  Definitions Related to Cross-Connection Control 
 
"Approved air gap" means a physical separation between the free-flowing end of a potable 
water supply pipeline and the overflow rim of an open or non-pressurized receiving vessel.  To 
be an air gap approved by the department, the separation must be at least: 
 
• 
Twice the diameter of the supply piping measured vertically from the overflow rim of the 
receiving vessel, and in no case be less than one inch, when unaffected by vertical surfaces 
(sidewalls); and 
 
• Three times the diameter of the supply piping, if the horizontal distance between the 
supply pipe and a vertical surface (sidewall) is less than or equal to three times the 
diameter of the supply pipe, or if the horizontal distance between the supply pipe and 
intersecting vertical surfaces (sidewalls) is less than or equal to four times the diameter of 
the supply pipe and in no case less than one and one-half inches. 
 
"Approved atmospheric vacuum breaker" means an AVB of make, model, and size that is 
approved by the department.  *AVBs that appear on the current approved backflow prevention 
assemblies list developed by the University of Southern California Foundation for 
Cross-Connection Control and Hydraulic Research or that are listed or approved by other 
nationally recognized testing agencies (such as IAPMO, ANSI, or UL) acceptable to the local

accordance with chapter 246-292 WAC. 
 
"Backpressure" means a pressure (caused by a pump, elevated tank or piping, boiler, or other 
means) on the consumer's side of the service connection that is greater than the pressure provided 
by the public water system and which may cause backflow. 
 
"Backsiphonage" means backflow due to a reduction in system pressure in the purveyor's 
distribution system and/or consumer's water system. 
 
"Combination fire protection system" means a fire sprinkler system that: 
 
• 
Is supplied only by the purveyor's water; 
 
• 
Does not have a fire department pumper connection; and 
 
• 
Is constructed of approved potable water piping and materials that serve both the fire 
sprinkler system and the consumer's potable water system. 
 
"Consumer" means any person receiving water from a public water system from either the 
meter, or the point where the service line connects with the distribution system if no meter is 
present.  For purposes of cross-connection control, "consumer" means the owner or operator of a 
water system connected to a public water system through a service connection.

purveyor implements to protect the public water system from contamination via cross 
connections as required in WAC 246-290-490. 
 
"Cross-connection control specialist" means a person holding a valid CCS certificate issued in 
accordance with chapter 246-292 WAC. 
 
"Cross-connection control summary report" means the annual report that describes the status 
of the purveyor's cross-connection control program. 
 
"Flow-through fire protection system" means a fire sprinkler system that: 
 
• Is supplied only by the purveyor's water; 
 
• Does not have a fire department pumper connection; 
 
• Is constructed of approved potable water piping and materials to which sprinkler heads 
are attached; and 
 
• Terminates at a connection to a toilet or other plumbing fixture to prevent the water from 
becoming stagnant. 
 
"High health cross-connection hazard" means a cross connection which could impair the 
quality of potable water and create an actual public health hazard through poisoning or spread of 
disease by sewage, industrial liquids or waste. 
 
"In-premises protection" means a method of protecting the health of consumers served by the 
consumer's potable water system, located within the property lines of the consumer's premises by 
the installation of an approved air gap or backflow prevention assembly at the point of hazard, 
which is generally a plumbing fixture.

treatment system that has been adequately and reliably treated, so that as a result of that 
treatment, it is suitable for beneficial use or a controlled use that would not otherwise occur, and 
it is no longer considered wastewater. 
 
"Unapproved auxiliary water supply" means a water supply (other than the purveyor's water 
supply) on or available to the consumer's premises that is either not approved for human 
consumption by the health agency having jurisdiction or is not otherwise acceptable to the 
purveyor. 
 
"Uniform Plumbing Code" means the code adopted under RCW 19.27.031(4) and amended 
under chapter 51-46 WAC.  This code establishes statewide minimum plumbing standards 
applicable within the property lines of the consumer's premises. 
 
"Used water" means water which has left the control of the purveyor.

8.2.2 WAC 246-290-490  Cross-Connection Control. 
 
(1) Applicability, purpose, and responsibility. 
 
(a) All community water systems shall comply with the cross-connection control 
requirements specified in this section. 
 
(b) All non-community water systems shall apply the principles and provisions of this 
section, including subsection (4)(b) of this section, as applicable to protect the public 
water system from contamination via cross connections.  Non-community systems that 
comply with subsection (4)(b) of this section and the provisions of WAC 51-46-0603 of 
the UPC (which addresses the installation of backflow preventers at points of water use 
within the potable water system) shall be considered in compliance with the 
requirements of this section. 
 
(c) The purpose of the purveyor's cross-connection control program shall be to protect the 
public water system, as defined in WAC 246-290-010, from contamination via cross 
connections. 
 
(d) The purveyor's responsibility for cross-connection control shall begin at the water supply 
source, include all the public water treatment, storage, and distribution facilities, and end 
at the point of delivery to the consumer's water system, which begins at the downstream 
end of the service connection or water meter located on the public right-of-way or 
utility-held easement. 
 
(e) Under the provisions of this section, purveyors are not responsible for eliminating or 
controlling cross connections within the consumer's water system.  Under chapter 19.27 
RCW, the responsibility for cross-connection control within the consumer's water 
system, i.e., within the property lines of the consumer's premises, falls under the 
jurisdiction of the local administrative authority.

8.3 
Frequently Asked Regulatory Interpretation Questions and Answers 
 
Section 1 
Applicability, Purpose, and Responsibility 
 
Q. 
Do all non-community systems have to develop and implement Cross-Connection 
Control (CCC) Programs? 
 
A. 
Yes.  The intent is to provide the same level of public health protection for non-community 
water systems as small Group A community systems.  Non-community systems can use this 
manual as guidance for development and implementation of their CCC programs.    
 
Q. 
How do the minimum elements in Section 3 of Washington Administrative Code 
(WAC) 246-290-490 apply to non-community systems, especially single-purpose 
systems, where the purveyor and customer are essentially the same? 
 
A. 
The elements of Section 3 apply to all Group A systems.  However, the effort needed to 
comply may be minimal for some non-community systems.  For a single-purpose system, it 
may only be necessary to confirm in a hazard assessment that protection of the source of 
supply is adequate.  Depending on the nature of the system, source protection could be 
achieved through installation of a backflow preventer to directly protect the source and/or 
through installation of backflow preventers at the points of hazard (i.e., fixtures) per the 
Uniform Plumbing Code (UPC).  A sample written CCC program for a non-community 
system is provided in Appendix B of this manual.  The sample program contains the 
minimum elements listed in WAC 246-290-490(3).

Q. 
Was the intent for large non-community systems to "just" comply with the Uniform 
Plumbing Code (UPC)?  Would premises isolation ever be appropriate for a large non-
community system? 
 
A. 
No, it was not the intent for large non-community systems to merely comply with the UPC.  
For most non-community systems, Washington State Department of Health (DOH) and the 
Local Administrative Authority (LAA) have overlapping jurisdictions.  Thus, non-community 
systems must comply with both WAC 246-290-490 and the UPC.  Regarding the UPC, the 
non-community system must comply with the plumbing code in effect at the time the 
plumbing permit was issued (i.e., at time of construction).  
 
Regarding WAC 246-290-490, premises isolation may be appropriate, and in some cases 
required, for large non-community systems, depending on the types of hazards posed to the 
distribution system.  The CCC requirements of WAC 246-290-490 are, in some cases, more 
stringent than the UPC, specifically in the area of mandatory premises isolation.  So merely 
complying with the UPC would not provide the protection required by the drinking water 
regulations.  For a non-community system, area, building, and/or source isolation may be 
needed to protect the distribution system and source of supply from contamination via cross-
connections (i.e., from being a conduit for the spread of contaminants between buildings or 
areas of concentration of population). 
 
Section 2 
General Program Requirements 
 
Q. 
Do alternate references have to be acceptable to Washington State Department of 
Health (DOH)?  What criteria does DOH use to accept alternate references? 
 
A. 
The purveyor’s CCC program must be acceptable to DOH.  The DOH regional engineer 
reviewing a CCC program will accept the two publications listed as guidance in WAC 246-
290-490.  Alternate guidance manuals may be acceptable, if certain criteria are met.  The 
criteria DOH uses to accept alternate references are:  1) The manual reflects current 
industry practices and standards; 2). The manual has been produced by a nationally 
recognized organization with expertise in cross-connection control, such as American 
Water Works Association (AWWA), University of Southern California Foundation for Cross 
Connection Control and Hydraulic Research (USCFCCCHR), American Backflow 
Prevention Association (ABPA), or United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA); 
and 3). The manual has undergone association and/or peer review by AWWA, 
USCFCCCHR, ABPA, federal and/or state public health officials and professional 
engineers. 
 
Q. 
Will the department develop a "public listing" of Washington State Department of 
Health (DOH) certified Cross-Connection Control Specialists (CCSs) willing to act as 
consultants to small water systems?  What are the guidelines for hiring a CCS?  
 
________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems 
March 2004 
Chapter 8 
Page 143 
 
 
A. 
DOH has developed a contract operators public listing.  All contract operators must be 
DOH-certified CCSs.  The contract operators list is available on the Office of Drinking 
Water’s website:  http://www.doh.wa.gov/ 
 
DOH does not have a brochure developed that provides specific guidelines for hiring a 
contract CCS.  However, this issue is discussed in detail in Chapter 7.  Before hiring a CCS 
on contract, at a minimum, purveyors are strongly encouraged to carefully check the 
CCS’s:  
 
• 
Familiarity with the most recently published version of WAC 246-290-490;  
 
• 
Relevant experience with other similar water systems;  
 
• 
Extent of coordination with DOH headquarters and regional office CCC staff; 
 
• 
Participation in the DOH CCC-related committees;  
 
• 
Participation in regional and national CCC groups; and  
 
• 
Public water system (PWS) references (at least 3).  
 
Sample CCC written programs developed by the CCS should also be available for the 
purveyor to review.  It is recommended that proposals be obtained from at least three CCSs. 
Some contract operators may have minimal experience in the development and 
implementation of CCC programs.  Thus, in addition to the DOH Contract Operators list, 
purveyors are encouraged to network with their regional CCC groups for a list of more 
experienced consultant CCSs. 
 
Note:  High prices do not necessarily indicate quality work.  Contracts should specify that 
the written CCC program plan produced must comply with the current WAC 246-290-490.  
Availability for technical consultation on an as-needed basis is an item to also consider 
including in the contract.  Another suggestion is to include language in the contract that 
final payment will not be made by the purveyor, until the written program plan has been 
reviewed and accepted by DOH.   
 
Q. 
What does “coordination” with Local Administrative Authority (LAA) mean? 
 
A. 
Coordination is explained in detail in Chapter 6.  Coordination may range from a minimal 
effort, i.e., an exchange of information with the LAA, to an extensive level of coordination, 
i.e., implementation of a joint program.  The advantages and disadvantages of the range of 
levels of coordination are discussed in Chapter 6.  Purveyors must describe the level of 
coordination in their written CCC program plans.  When a joint program is selected as the 
preferred option, although not required, DOH recommends that a written agreement be 
developed between the purveyor and the LAA. 
________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems

Chapter 8 
Page 144 
 
 
Note:   Efforts are currently underway in Snohomish County to develop standardized 
language to use when developing written coordination agreements between 
purveyors and LAAs in Washington.  Purveyors are encouraged to stay informed 
about this effort through their regional CCC groups.  Once developed, DOH hopes 
to incorporate the sample agreement language into a future update of this manual. 
 
Q. 
Must a Cross-Connection Control program be submitted to Washington State 
Department of Health (DOH) for review? 
 
A. 
Yes, per WAC246-290-490(2)(e), it was DOH’s intent for written program plans to be 
included in the purveyor’s Water System Plan (WSP) or Small Water System Management 
Program (SWSMP) that are submitted to DOH for review and approval.  However, not all 
Group A systems must submit WSPs or SWSMPs.  For example, small, non-expanding water 
systems are not required to submit planning documents, unless specifically requested to do 
so by DOH due to system operational problems.  DOH also intended to be able to request 
submission of the purveyor’s written CCC program plan as a stand-alone document or to 
request that the plan be made available for review as part of the sanitary survey process. 
 
Q. 
Can a purveyor rely solely upon a premises isolation program or rely solely upon an 
in-premises program to protect the public water system (PWS) from contamination? 
 
A. 
Purveyors may rely solely upon premises isolation programs to protect their systems from 
contamination.  However, the opposite is not true.  Thus, purveyors can’t rely solely upon 
in-premises programs to protect the PWS from contamination.  An in-premises type of 
program is unacceptable, because the CCC regulations require all purveyors to ensure that 
premises isolation is provided for high health hazard categories of premises of the type 
listed in Table 9 of WAC 246-290-490. 
 
Systems do have the option of implementing a combination program that relies on premises 
isolation for high-hazard premises and relies on in-premises protection for non-high hazard 
premises.  When the purveyor chooses this combination program option, all conditions in 
WAC 246-290-490(2)(h) must be met. 
 
Q. 
Are purveyors required to shut-off or deny water service to customers that fail to 
comply with the purveyor's cross-connection control requirements? 
 
A. 
No, water shut-off is only one of the enforcement tools available to purveyors.  The 
responsibility of the purveyor is to protect the PWS from contamination.  Water shut-off may 
be appropriate under emergency conditions (e.g., backflow incident occurring, cross 
connection with sewage).  However, in lieu of water shutoff, the purveyor may choose to 
install the necessary backflow preventer, if the customer fails to comply with the request to 
install a backflow preventer.   
 
________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems 
March 2004 
Chapter 8 
Page 145 
 
 
Shutting off water service may cause a public health hazard.  In addition, shutting off water 
service without reasonable cause or adequate legal authority may expose the purveyor to a 
claim for damages.  DOH is in the process of developing guidance to purveyors regarding 
water shutoff.  Once finalized, DOH plans to include the guidance material in this manual.  
 
Q. 
Why is it necessary to notify the Local Administrative Authority (LAA), before I shut 
off a customer’s water? 
 
A. 
This requirement is in the regulations, because the purveyor’s actions may affect the public 
health and safety of occupants and/or users of the customer's premises.  For example, the 
shut off of potable water service affects building occupancy, adding a double-check valve 
assembly (DCVA) on the service affects thermal expansion, and the shutoff of a fire line 
affects public safety.  For liability management, the purveyor should not take any action 
known to affect public health or safety without notifying the LAA having jurisdiction.  
 
Q. 
Why is it necessary to prevent the intentional return of water to the distribution 
system (e.g., from heat exchangers)? 
 
A. 
In a PWS, the normal flow of water is from the source of supply to the customer’s tap.  
Thus, many contaminants introduced into the customer’s plumbing system by the 
customer (through backflow incidents, inadequate disinfection of repair work, etc.) will 
likely remain in the customer's system, until the customer’s normal use flushes the 
contaminants from a tap.  
 
However, a return system circumvents this natural protection for the PWS. More 
importantly, the purveyor has no control over the quality of water that has left the 
purveyor's distribution system.  Even when the returned water is supposedly potable, a 
change in temperature may adversely affect the purveyor's system (e.g., increased water 
temperature may enhance bacteria re-growth in the distribution system).  Prohibiting the 
intentional return of used water to the purveyor’s distribution system protects the quality 
of water served to consumers.

Section 3 
Minimum Elements of a Cross-Connection Control (CCC) Program 
 
Q. 
Do the regulations specify when purveyors need to complete their initial hazard 
assessments? 
 
A. 
The regulations do not specify an absolute time frame for completing initial hazard 
assessments.  Chapter 7 of this manual includes general schedule guidelines.   
 
 
The revised CCC regulations became effective in April 1999.  As of the publication date of 
this manual, all Group A systems should have at least initiated their CCC programs.  At a 
minimum, DOH will review the purveyor’s written program plan when a system submits a 
WSP or SWSMP.  The written program plan must include procedures and reasonable 
schedules for ensuring completion of initial hazard assessments for existing and new 
customers. 
 
For example, a plan may indicate for existing customers that the initial hazard evaluations 
will be completed within one year of program startup.  For new connections, the purveyor 
should now be making initial hazard evaluations prior to service being provided.  As a 
practical matter, the purveyor will need to first establish a CCC policy, retain the services of 
a CCS, etc. before assessing hazards.  
 
 
Purveyors will show DOH their system’s implementation progress through submission of 
the Annual Summary Report (ASR) forms, and/or through sanitary surveys.  
 
Q. 
When must the purveyor start installing backflow prevention assemblies? 
 
A. 
The CCC regulations do not establish an absolute time frame.  However, Chapter 7 of this 
manual includes general guidelines.  The purveyor's written program plan must establish 
procedures and schedules for backflow preventer installation.  The time allowed should be 
based on the degree of hazard posed to the PWS.  For example, a plan may specify that all 
customers of the type listed on Table 9 of WAC 246-290-490 will have backflow prevention 
installed within two years of notification and that all low-hazard fire lines will have 
backflow prevention installed when the building is renovated or enlarged.   
 
Q. 
What is an acceptable time frame for submission of a test report? 
 
A. 
A reasonable time frame for a backflow assembly tester (BAT) to provide the customer with 
a test report is within ten business days of performing the test.  In general, for the annual 
backflow assembly test report, most purveyors allow customers 30 to 45 days to submit the 
paperwork from the anniversary date.  In rural areas, where only a few BATs are available, 
purveyors may need to allow a longer period (e.g., 45-60 days).  Purveyors need to make 
sure their customer’s receive notice for the test long before the anniversary date.  Purveyors 
should not send out the testing notices at the last minute and expect their customers to rush 
to comply.

Note:  The annual test doesn’t need to be completed on the precise anniversary date of the 
last test.  Most purveyors consider a timeframe within thirty days of the anniversary date 
reasonable for the annual test to be performed. 
 
Q. 
What is the purpose of the quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) program? 
 
A. 
The purpose of the QA/QC program is to ensure consistency and reliability in the testing of 
assemblies that protect the PWS.  Although not fail-proof, the quality assurance program 
should help prevent and/or reduce some of the problems purveyors have encountered in the 
past with BAT performance.  These problems have included submission of incomplete or 
false test reports, use of incorrect test procedures, and testing errors made due to 
improperly calibrated test equipment.  Also, the additional hands-on training time in BAT 
courses and tightening of the DOH BAT certification exam process should help improve 
BAT performance statewide. 
 
Section 4 
Approved Backflow Preventer Selection 
 
Q. 
Are purveyors limited to the categories in Table 9 of Washington Administrative Code 
(WAC) 246-290-490 for mandatory premises isolation? 
 
A. 
No.  Table 9 of WAC 246-290-490 is not all-inclusive, and in fact, only identifies typical 
high-hazard categories of premises served by most large PWSs in Washington.  Table 9 
of WAC 246-290-490 is essentially the minimum list of categories that require premises 
isolation.  Other states and technical references may include additional categories in their 
mandatory premises isolation lists.   
 
Purveyors must ensure that all premises of the type listed on Table 9 of WAC 246-290-490 
meet the mandatory premises isolation requirements.  Although purveyors may not delete a 
mandatory isolation category from Table 9 of WAC 246-290-490, they may add to the Table 
9 of WAC 246-290-490 list.  
 
Additions may be based on industry guidance and the purveyor’s policy for risk and liability 
management.  For example, airline manufacturing plants are not specifically listed on Table 
9 of WAC 246-290-490, but must be considered as high hazard premises for the few PWSs 
in Washington that provide water service to them.  As another example, for risk and liability 
management, a purveyor may choose to require premises isolation DCVAs on all malls, 
because of the complexity of their piping systems and high probability of changes in tenants 
(i.e., water use).

Q. 
Some of the categories on Table 9 of Washington Administrative Code (WAC) 246-
290-490 are confusing.  For example, are gas stations included in the Petroleum 
Storage and Processing category?  Are restaurants included in the Food Processing 
Plant category? 
 
A. 
The intent of Table 9 of WAC 246-290-490 is to identify typical categories of facilities that 
pose a high health hazard to the PWS.  This rating is due to one or more of the following:  
the complexity of their plumbing and industrial piping systems, frequency of plumbing and 
piping changes, scale of operations (large, commercial), the presence of hazardous 
materials, and/or hazardous processes/activities occurring on-site.   
 
DOH intended for the category Petroleum Storage and Processing facilities to address bulk 
storage facilities (i.e., tank farms) and refineries; DOH did not intend for this category to 
include neighborhood gas stations.  Similarly, DOH intended for the Food Processing Plant 
category to address canneries, beef packing houses, potato processors, fruit processors, 
etc., and in general did not intend for the category to include local restaurants. 
 
Q. 
Which irrigation systems require premises isolation? 
 
A. 
The UPC establishes backflow protection requirements for irrigation systems in 
Washington.  However, the UPC does not cover dedicated irrigation systems supplied 
directly from the purveyor’s distribution main (i.e., not supplied through customer’s 
domestic service line).  Under Table 9 of WAC 246-290-490, irrigation systems with 
chemical addition that are supplied through a dedicated line (i.e., separate from the 
domestic service line) require premises isolation with a reduced-pressure backflow 
assembly (RPBA).  Dedicated irrigation lines are typically found at parks, playgrounds, 
golf courses, cemeteries, and estates.   
 
The UPC requires an RPBA on other irrigation systems with chemical addition.  For 
irrigation systems without chemical addition, the UPC requires a DCVA, pressure vacuum 
breaker assembly (PVBA) or atmospheric vacuum breaker (AVB).  The purveyor’s written 
program plan should address irrigation systems and indicate whether: 
 
• 
AVBs will be accepted to protect the PWS; or  
 
• 
An approved assembly (e.g., a testable DCVA) will be required.

Q. 
Is there a provision in the Washington Administrative Code (WAC) for the purveyor 
to grant an exception to the mandatory premises isolation requirements for premises 
of the type listed on Table 9 of WAC 246-290-490? 
 
A. 
Yes, the WAC does contain such a provision.  The exception provision is to be used in those 
rare instances where the customer's water use and hazard posed to the purveyor’s system 
don’t “match” the water use and high health hazard typically associated with the specific 
category of premises.  For example, a “beverage bottling plant” used only as a storage 
warehouse doesn’t pose the same degree of hazard as a plant where beverage bottling 
processes are taking place.  The purveyor's CCS must assess the degree of hazard and 
determine whether the granting of an exception is appropriate.  CCSs can use the "good 
engineering practices” described in the technical publications referenced in WAC 246-290-
490(2) to aid in exception determinations. 
 
When exceptions to mandatory premises isolation are granted, the CCS must document the 
reasons, i.e., provide justification for granting the exception.  DOH has developed an 
Exception Form for documenting the justification for granting an exception.  An Exception 
Form must be completed for each exception granted by the purveyor.  After the initial ASR 
is completed and submitted to DOH, Exception Forms must be submitted to DOH with the 
ASR for the reporting year in which the exception was granted.   
 
Q. 
As an "alternate location acceptable to the purveyor,” how far downstream of the 
meter may a premises isolation assembly be located? 
 
A. 
There is no general rule in terms of distance.  However, for risk management reasons, it is 
preferable that the assembly be located as close to the meter (property line) as possible and 
that no connections are made between the meter and the RPBA. 
 
For freeze protection, many purveyors allow the RPBA to be installed in the mechanical 
room of the building or at the point where the service line just enters the building.  Because 
the RPBA must isolate the customer’s plumbing from the PWS, there can be no connections 
made between the RPBA and the meter, unless they are specifically approved by the 
purveyor and have the appropriate backflow protection.   
 
Q. 
Must backflow protection for all existing fire sprinkler systems with chemical addition 
be upgraded to a reduced-pressure backflow assembly (RPBA) within 90 days of 
notifying the customer of the high health cross-connection hazard? 
 
A. 
No.  The WAC allows an alternate schedule acceptable to the purveyor to be adopted.  The 
90 days indicates the high health hazard assessment of fire sprinkler systems with chemical 
addition and the need to give priority to the installation of an RPBA.

The purveyor should work with the customer to establish a reasonable schedule for 
installation of the backflow preventer.  However, for risk management reasons, the earliest 
possible installation date provides the most benefit to the purveyor.  When working with 
customers to establish a mutually agreeable schedule, purveyors should consider the 
practical aspects of retrofitting an existing sprinkler system with the appropriate backflow 
protection (e.g., cost, obtaining permits, impacts on sprinkler performance, possible 
redesign of fire system, space limitations and scheduling a contractor).  In some situations, 
the customer may need as long as two years to get the backflow preventer installed (e.g., 
hospital). 
 
 
Note:  The RPBA requirement for high-hazard fire sprinkler systems should be imposed 
when the customer remodels or expands the building. 
 
Q. 
How can the customer obtain water to test plumbing, before backflow preventers are 
installed and tested? 
 
A. 
Normal practice is to provide a construction service with a water meter and an RPBA 
(DCVA minimum).  A construction site often poses a greater cross-connection hazard to the 
PWS than the completed facility.  
 
Section 5 
Approved Backflow Preventers 
 
Q. 
Where do I obtain a current list of Washington State Department of Health (DOH) 
approved assemblies? 
 
A. 
Purveyors may obtain hard copies of the list from DOH Office of Drinking Water upon 
request.  The Training and Outreach Section handles such requests.  Purveyors without 
Internet access can request the list by e-mail or by phone (see Appendix F for DOH contact 
information).  Purveyors with Internet access can request a list via the Drinking Water 
website: http://www.doh.wa.gov/ehp/dw  
 
 
Due to our agreement with USC (the organization that develops the list), DOH is not 
allowed to post the list on the Drinking Water website.  DOH publishes the list annually (at 
the beginning of each calendar year) and issues at least one update during the year.  DOH 
automatically sends updates to those systems, CCSs, BATs, etc., on file with DOH as having 
requested a list at the beginning of the calendar year. 
 
The purveyor’s CCS should have a copy of the most recently published DOH-Approved 
Assemblies List and understand how to use the information on the list.

Section 6 
Approved Backflow Preventer Installation 
 
Q. 
What are the requirements for installation? 
 
A. 
The standard installation procedures acceptable to DOH are provided in the technical 
publications such as the USC Manual or Pacific Northwest Section – American Water 
Works Association (PNWS-AWWA) Manual.  Large utilities and/or the regional cross-
connection groups may also have standard installation plans available that meet the 
technical specifications in the CCC manuals and can be used by small water systems.  
 
Q. 
Can a double-check valve assembly (DCVA) be installed in a below-ground pit?  What 
about the requirement that the purveyor ensure that an assembly is not flooded? 
 
A. 
Yes, a DCVA can be installed below grade (e.g., in a meter box).  The intent of the language 
regarding flooding was to prevent backflow assemblies from creating cross-connection 
hazards themselves.  To meet the intent of the WAC, with a below-grade type of installation, 
the purveyor must ensure that the assembly will not create a cross connection with ground 
water.  This can be accomplished by requiring test cock plugs to be installed with all below- 
grade assemblies. 
 
Section 7 
Approved Backflow Preventer Inspection and Testing 
 
Q. 
Must a cross-connection control specialist (CCS) inspect an atmospheric vacuum 
breaker (AVB) on a residential lawn sprinkler system? 
 
A. 
Yes.  All AVBs relied upon by the purveyor must inspected by a CCS at the time of 
installation, after a backflow incident and after repair, re-installation and re-inspection.  
The purpose of the inspection is to make sure the AVB is installed correctly and is operable, 
etc. The USC foundation recommends that AVBs be checked annually. 
 
Q. 
Annual assembly testing is a Washington State Department of Health (DOH) 
minimum requirement.  When would it be appropriate for a purveyor to require more 
testing? 
 
A. 
More frequent testing is appropriate when an assembly shows (from the historical test 
reports) signs of impending failure, but the assembly has not been replaced.  For example, if 
there is a question about the reliability of the assembly, the purveyor should require another 
test in six months.  In addition, some purveyors require more frequent testing for premises 
isolation assemblies installed at severe and high-hazard facilities such as nuclear facilities, 
sewage treatment plants, and hospitals.

Section 8 
 Recordkeeping and Reporting 
 
Q. 
What documentation must be kept? 
 
A. 
For each connection served, the purveyor must keep: 
 
• 
Information on the initial and subsequent hazard assessments (e.g., questionnaire 
and survey); and  
 
• 
Detailed assembly inventory information for all assemblies relied upon by the 
purveyor to protect the PWS.  Actual test report readings should be recorded and 
kept as part of the required assembly test report information.   
 
For connections with both a premises isolation assembly and one or more in-premises 
assemblies, the purveyor is only required to track information on the premises isolation 
assembly.  All assemblies other than the premises isolation assembly fall under the 
jurisdiction of the Local Administrative Authority. 
 
Q. 
When should records of test reports be kept in electronic format (i.e., other than 
manually)? 
 
A. 
The WAC allows records to be kept manually on paper or in electronic format, so the 
decision is left to the purveyor.  Most systems find that manual tracking becomes too 
difficult, when the number of assemblies that protect the PWS reaches 100 or more.   
 
Because they will have so few assemblies to track, many small water systems may be able to 
keep adequate records manually.  However, where a personal computer is used for word 
processing, it is a relatively easy task to establish a computer spreadsheet to track test 
reports.  Most small systems will not need to purchase more expensive, proprietary 
computer database software specifically designed for CCC program management.

Q. 
Must all backflow incidents be reported to DOH? 
 
A. 
Yes.  Purveyors must notify DOH, the local administrative authority, and the local health 
jurisdiction as soon as possible and no later than the next business day of any backflow 
incident that contaminates the PWS or customer’s plumbing.  Purveyors can consult the 
PNWS-AWWA Backflow Incident Investigation Manual for information on how to proceed 
with investigation and clean up. 
 
The purveyor must document (on a form acceptable to DOH) the details of any incidents 
that contaminated the PWS.  However, for risk management purposes, it is prudent for 
purveyors to report all known backflow incidents to DOH, including incidents where the 
contaminant was contained within the customer’s premises.  This additional information 
can be helpful when DOH is coordinating with the State Building Code Council on UPC 
issues and for demonstrating the effectiveness of premises isolation for protection of the 
PWS.

Appendix A 
Example Cross-Connection Control Program and  
Legal Instrument for a Community System 
 
 
Contents 
 
This appendix contains an example written cross-connection control (CCC) program plan and an 
example legal instrument for a community system.  The legal instrument establishes the authority 
of a public water system (PWS) to adopt and implement a CCC program.   
 
The primary type of program that these documents address is a premises isolation type of pro-
gram.  However, alternate wording or passages are included for combination or joint types of 
programs.  Other commonly used alternate approaches and optional additional requirements are 
also included where appropriate. 
 
 
How to Use Appendix A 
 
The example program and legal instrument in Appendix A have been designed for use by com-
munity systems where the majority of the service connections are residences or premises owned 
or occupied by private or public entities separate from the purveyor. 
 
The documents in this appendix have been arranged and formatted for ease of review by the 
Washington State Department of Health (DOH) when it evaluates the program with respect to 
the regulations.  Therefore, DOH recommends that purveyors follow the format (i.e., use the ex-
ample program as a template) whenever possible.  However, PWSs are not required to use the 
example program and legal instrument.  DOH recognizes that some PWSs may have a particular 
approach or institutional requirements that may dictate a different format or wording in the writ-
ten program plan. 
 
 
Instructions 
 
To use the example program plan, water systems are encouraged to: 
 
1. Download the example program file (in Microsoft Word format) from the web site or ob-
tain from DOH electronically; 
2. Retain the basic formatting and text of the example program and fill in the blanks, deci-
sion table, and check boxes where indicated to “customize” the example program; 
3. Include or delete optional and/or additional language shown in the example program to 
reflect system-specific decisions; and 
4. Insert the completed written CCC program plan in the Small Water System Management 
Program (SWSMP) or Water System Plan (WSP).

Cross-Connection Control Program Plan 
for _________________ Water System 
 
 
A.  
Requirement for Program 
 
{Insert public water system name}, {insert public water system identification number}, 
hereinafter referred to as “the Purveyor”, has the responsibility to protect the public water system 
from contamination due to cross connections.  A cross connection may be defined as “any actual or 
potential physical connection between a potable water line and any pipe, vessel, or machine that 
contains or has a probability of containing a non-potable gas or liquid, such that it is possible for a 
non-potable gas or liquid to enter the potable water system by backflow.” 
 
All public water systems are required to develop and implement cross-connection control (CCC) 
programs.  The CCC requirements are contained in Washington Administrative Code (WAC) 246-
290-490 of the Group A Drinking Water Regulations.  The minimum required elements of a CCC 
program are: 
 
1. Establishment of legal authority and program policies; 
2. Evaluation of premises for cross-connection hazards; 
3. Elimination and/or control of cross connections; 
4. Provision of qualified personnel; 
5. Inspection and testing of backflow preventers; 
6. Quality control of testing process; 
7. Response to backflow incidents; 
8. Public education for consumers; 
9. Record keeping for CCC program; and 
10. Special requirements for reclaimed water use. 
 
Other CCC program requirements include: 
 
1. Coordination with the Local Administrative Authority (LAA), i.e., the local building or 
plumbing official regarding CCC activities; 
2. Prohibition of the return of used water into the public water system (PWS) distribution 
system; and 
3. Inclusion of a written CCC program in a Water System Plan (WSP) or a Small Water 
System Management Program (SWSMP). 
 
Note:  Throughout the example CCC program plan the term customer is used.  Customer as used 
herein means the property owner and/or occupant of the premises served by the PWS (i.e., 
whoever interfaces with the PWS regarding water service).  Also, unless otherwise defined, all 
CCC-related terms used in this example program have the same definitions as those contained in 
WAC 246-290-010 of the Washington State Drinking Water Regulations.

Program Objectives 
 
The objectives of the CCC program are to:  
 
1. Reasonably reduce the risk of contamination of the public water distribution system; and 
2. Reasonably reduce the Purveyor's exposure to legal liability arising from the backflow of 
any contaminant originating from the customer's plumbing system and then supplied to 
other customers; and 
3. [Add for Joint Program: “Cooperate with the LAA by joint operation of program 
administrative tasks.”]

Required Elements of Program 
 
The drinking water regulations for Group A public water systems in Washington, WAC 246-290, 
require CCC programs to include certain minimum elements.  The elements are listed in WAC 246-
290-490(3).  This section describes how the water system intends to comply with each of the 
required program elements.  Elements are numbered the same as they appear in the WAC. 
 
 
Element 1: Adoption of a written legal instrument authorizing the establishment and 
implementation of a CCC program. 
 
The {Insert PWS name} water system has adopted a resolution (Resolution No. _________), 
reproduced as Exhibit _____, which authorizes the Purveyor to implement a CCC program.  The 
resolution also authorizes the system to terminate water service to consumers who do not comply 
with the resolution.  However, the primary method for protection of the distribution system will be 
the installation of a backflow preventer by the customer, at the customer’s expense.  [Optional 
approach: “by the water system, and the cost thereof to be billed to the customer.” (see Decision 
Table Items 6 and 9)]  (The Purveyor can substitute appropriate wording to reflect alternate 
decisions made by the PWS.) 
 
The attached service contract referred to in the resolution shall be the primary enforcement authority 
for all new customers.   
 
For customers supplied prior to the adoption of the attached resolution, an implied service contract 
allows the Purveyor to protect the distribution system from contamination through a Purveyor-
installed backflow preventer on a customer's service.  
 
The written and implied contract terms are discussed further under Element 3. 
 
(The Purveyor should complete and include the following schedule for adoption of a legal 
instrument, if not already adopted: 
 
 
Legal Instrument Status 
Schedule 
Preparation of proposed legal instrument 
 
Introduction of the legal instrument to governing body 
 
Adoption of legal instrument 
 
Legal instrument becomes effective 
 
 
Schedules may vary depending on governing body procedures.)

Element 2: 
Development and implementation of procedures and schedules for evaluating new 
and existing service connections to assess the degree of hazard. 
 
Initial Cross-Connection Hazard Surveys 
 
The procedures for evaluating the backflow prevention requirements for new and existing customers 
are as follows: 
 
1. For all new non-residential services, the Purveyor will require that the customer submit 
with the application for water service an evaluation (performed at customer’s expense) by a 
DOH-certified cross-connection control specialist (CCS) of the hazard posed by the 
proposed plumbing system, with recommendations for the installation at the meter of either 
a double-check valve assembly (DCVA) or a reduced-pressure principle backflow assembly 
(RPBA).  [Combination or Joint Program Alternative: “or commensurate in-premises 
backflow protection.”]  The Purveyor may accept the recommendations or submit the 
recommendations to a CCS employed by the PWS for peer review and concurrence, before 
acceptance.  
 
As an alternative to the above requirement for a survey by a CCS, the customer may agree 
to install an approved air gap (AG) or RPBA for premises isolation as a condition of service.  
 
2. For all new residential services, the Purveyor will require that the customer submit with the 
application for water service a completed “Water Use Questionnaire” (copy shown on page 
{PWS insert page number here}).  If the customer's questionnaire indicates special 
plumbing, such as a lawn sprinkler system, or hazardous water use on the premises, the 
customer shall submit to the Purveyor an evaluation by a DOH-certified CCS of the hazard 
posed by the proposed special plumbing system, with recommendations for the installation 
at the meter of either a DCVA or an RPBA.  [Combination or Joint Program Alternative: 
“or commensurate in-premises protection.”] 
 
As an alternative to the above requirement for a survey by a DOH-certified CCS, the 
Purveyor, at his/her discretion, may specify the backflow preventer required to be installed 
as a condition of service.  
 
3. For all existing non-residential services, the Purveyor will require the customer to submit to 
the Purveyor, within nine months of notification, an evaluation by a DOH-certified CCS, of 
the hazard posed by the plumbing system, with recommendations for the installation at the 
meter of either a DCVA or an RPBA.  [Combination or Joint Program Alternative: “or 
commensurate in-premises backflow preventers.”]  The Purveyor may accept the 
recommendations or submit the recommendations to a CCS employed by the Purveyor for 
peer review and concurrence, before acceptance.  
 
As an alternative to the above requirement for a survey by a DOH-certified CCS, the 
customer may agree to install an AG or RPBA for premises isolation within 90 days of 
notification by the Purveyor or an alternate time period acceptable to the Purveyor.

4. For all existing residential services, the Purveyor will require the customer to submit to the 
Purveyor, within four months of notification, a completed “Water Use Questionnaire.”  If 
the customer's reply indicates special plumbing or water use on the premises, the customer 
shall submit an evaluation by a DOH-certified CCS of the hazard posed to the water system 
by the customer’s plumbing system, with recommendations for the installation at the meter 
of either a DCVA or an RPBA.  [Combination or Joint Program Alternative:  “or 
commensurate in-premises backflow preventers”.] 
 
 
As an alternative to the above requirement for a survey by a CCS, the Purveyor may specify 
the backflow preventer required to be installed as a condition of service.  The Purveyor’s 
CCS will provide guidance on the type of backflow preventer to be installed. 
 
5. For all existing services, should the customer fail to supply the required information for a 
hazard assessment or fail to submit a completed “Water Use Questionnaire,” the Purveyor 
may have the assessment made by a CCS employed by the Purveyor, require the installation 
of an RPBA for premises isolation, or take other such actions consistent with the previously 
stated policies and bill the customer for the associated costs. 
 
Cross-Connection Hazard Survey Schedule for Initial Hazard Assessments 
 
The schedule for initial hazard assessment is outlined in the following table.  The schedule starts 
from the date the CCC program is established.   
 
 
Initial Assessment Task 
Schedule 
Assessment of all new connections 
At time of application for 
water service 
Within nine months 
Identification and assessment of high-hazard premises 
which are listed on Table 9 of Washington Administrative

requirements are: 
 
1. For residential services, the Purveyor will require the customer to submit to the Purveyor, 
within two months of purveyor notification, a completed “Water Use Questionnaire.”  The 
procedure used for evaluating the hazard re-assessment and the potential change in the 
required backflow prevention will be the same as used for the initial hazard assessment. 
_____________________________________________________________________________________________ 
Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems 
March 2004 
Appendix A Page 163 
 
2. For all non-residential services, the Purveyor will require the customer to submit to the 
Purveyor, within two months of purveyor notification, a hazard re-assessment (at the 
customer’s expense) by a DOH-certified CCS. 
 
The frequency of hazard re-assessments will be as shown in the table below: 
 
 
Type of Service 
Frequency of  
Re-Evaluation 
Any services with reduced-pressure principle backflow 
assembly (RPBA) installed for premises isolation 
None required as long as 
the RPBA passes annual 
tests and inspections 
Commercial services with double-check valve assembly 
(DCVA) installed for premises isolation 
Every two years and upon 
change in use or 
ownership 
[Combination or Joint Program Alternative: Commercial 
services when purveyor relies upon in-premises protection] 
Every two years and upon 
change in use, ownership, 
or plumbing system 
Every 2-3 years 
(questionnaire) 
Residential services with special plumbing where the 
purveyor relies upon compliance with Uniform Plumbing 
Code (UPC) 
Residential services with DCVA installed for premises 
isolation 
Every 4-5 years 
(questionnaire) 
Residential services with no known special plumbing or water 
use on the premises 
Every 4-5 years and upon 
change in use, ownership, 
or plumbing system 
(questionnaire) 
 
 
The Purveyor will inform the customer that the Purveyor's survey of a customer's premises (whether 
by a representative of the Purveyor or through the evaluation of a questionnaire completed by the 
customer) is for the sole purpose of establishing the Purveyor's minimum requirements for the 
protection of the public water supply system, and that the required backflow protection will be 
commensurate with the Purveyor's assessment of the degree of hazard.   
 
The Purveyor will also inform the customer or any regulatory agencies that the Purveyor's survey, 
requirements for the installation of backflow prevention assemblies, lack of requirements for the 
installation of backflow prevention assemblies, or other actions by the purveyor’s personnel or 
agent do not constitute an approval of the customer's plumbing system or an assurance to the 
customer or any regulatory agency of the absence of cross connections.

Element 3: 
Development and implementation of procedures and schedules for elimination 
and/or control of cross-connections. 
 
Backflow Preventer Requirements 
 
The following service policy shall apply to all new and existing customers: 
 
1. The Purveyor will require that water service to all non-residential customers be isolated at 
the meter by a DOH-approved DCVA or RPBA acceptable to the Purveyor.  All high-
hazard connections of the type described in Table 9 of WAC 246-290-490 shall be isolated 
with an RPBA.  [Recommended Option: “All other non-residential customers shall be 
isolated with a DCVA.”]   
 
[Optional Combination or Joint Program Alternative: “In lieu of isolation with a DCVA, 
other non-residential customers, with the concurrence of the Purveyor’s CCS, may install 
in-premises protection commensurate with the degree of hazard, as determined by the 
Purveyor’s CCS.”] 
 
2. The Purveyor will require all residential customers with facilities of the type described in 
Table 9 of WAC 246-290-490 to be isolated with an RPBA.  All other residential customers 
with special plumbing or water use on the premises will be isolated with a DCVA.  “Special 
plumbing” includes, but is not limited to, the following: 
 
a. A lawn irrigation system; 
b. A solar heating system; 
c. An auxiliary source of supply, e.g., a well or creek; 
d. Piping for livestock watering, hobby farming, etc.; 
e. Residential fire sprinkler system; and 
f. Property containing a small boat moorage. 
 
3. [Optional addition: “Additional premises requiring premises isolation.  The Purveyor has 
chosen to supplement Table 9 of WAC 246-290-490(4) by identifying additional premises or 
premises types for which premises isolation is mandated.  Such premises will include 
aircraft and automotive manufacturers, pulp and paper mills, military bases, tall buildings, 
premises with complex plumbing, premises with plumbing subject to frequent changes, 
plumbing with a repeat history of cross-connections being established or reestablished, 
premises with public swimming pools, and {Purveyor should add other premises or 
premises types}.”] 
 
4. [Optional addition: “All remaining residential customers will be isolated at the meter by a 
purveyor-installed meter check valve (single or dual).”] [Combination or Joint Program 
Alternative:  “Residential customers not required to be isolated with an RPBA may install 
in-premises protection in accordance with the Uniform Plumbing Code (UPC) in lieu of 
isolation with a DCVA.”] 
 
_____________________________________________________________________________________________ 
Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems 
March 2004 
Appendix A Page 165 
 
5. For all customers that have a written service contract with the Purveyor, the required 
premises isolation DCVA or RPBA shall be: 
 
• 
Purchased and installed by the customer (at the customer's expense) immediately 
downstream of the water meter in accordance with the Purveyor's standards described 
hereinafter; and 
• 
Maintained, tested, and inspected in accordance with the Purveyor's standards described 
hereinafter. 
 
For new customers, the Purveyor will not turn on water (except for testing purposes) at the 
meter until the customer complies with the above requirements. 
 
The failure of the customer to comply with the Purveyor’s installation and maintenance 
requirements shall constitute a breach of contract by the customer.  The Purveyor may then 
proceed with corrective action provisions stipulated in the contract. 
 
6. Customers without written contracts are considered to have an implied contract that 
requires the customer to bear all reasonable costs of service.  The Purveyor will install the 
required DCVA or RPBA on the service, upstream of the meter, and charge the customer 
for the cost of the initial installation, and all future maintenance, testing, and repair, as set 
forth in the Purveyor's schedule of rates and charges.  The failure of the customer to pay 
these costs shall constitute a breach of contract by the customer, and the Purveyor will 
proceed with the established delinquency of payment procedures.  As an alternative, the 
customer may sign a service contract and install the required backflow preventer 
downstream of the meter in accordance with the Purveyor’s installation standards 
described hereinafter. 
 
7. Approved Backflow Preventers and Installation 
 
All backflow preventers relied upon by the Purveyor to protect the public water system shall 
meet the definition of “approved backflow preventer” as contained in WAC 246-290-010.  
The Purveyor will obtain and maintain a current list of assemblies approved for installation 
in Washington State from the DOH Office of Drinking Water. 
 
All backflow preventers will be installed in: 
 
• 
The orientation for which they are approved; 
• 
A manner and location that facilitates their proper operation, maintenance, and testing or 
inspection;   
• 
A manner that will protect them from weather-related conditions such as flooding and 
freezing; and 
• 
Compliance with applicable safety regulations.

Hydraulic Research (USCFCCCHR) CCC Manual shall be followed unless the 
manufacturer’s requirements are more stringent.  [Optional Alternative: “Installation shall 
conform to standard construction drawings and specifications of the Purveyor.”] 
 
The Purveyor has no regulatory responsibility or authority over the installation and 
operation of the customer's plumbing system.  The customer is solely responsible for 
compliance with all applicable regulations and for prevention of contamination of his 
plumbing system from sources within his/her premises.  Any action taken by the Purveyor 
to survey plumbing, inspect or test backflow prevention assemblies, or to require premises 
isolation (installation of DCVA or RPBA on service) is solely for the purposes of reducing 
the risk of contamination of the Purveyor's distribution system. 
 
The Purveyor will inform the customer that any action taken by the Purveyor shall not be 
construed by the customer as guidance on the safety or reliability of the customer’s 
plumbing system.  The Purveyor will not provide advice to the customer on the design and 
installation of plumbing other than through the general public education program discussed 
in Element 8. 
 
Except for easements containing the Purveyor's distribution system, the Purveyor will not 
undertake work on the customer's premises.

reports required by WAC 246-290-490.”]  
 
[Option 2: “The Purveyor’s CCS will review all CCC-related reports for correctness.”]   
 
[Optional addition: “The manager of the public water system shall sign the CCC reports 
before submission to DOH.”]  
 
 
Element 10: 
Additional cross-connection control requirements for reclaimed water.  
 
At this time the {Insert PWS name} does not receive or distribute reclaimed water.  In the event 
that reclaimed water use is proposed within the PWS’s service area, the Purveyor will make all 
cross-connection control requirements mandated by the Permitting Authority in accordance with 
Chapter 90.46 RCW part of the written CCC program plan and comply with such additional 
requirements. 
 
[Alternative if PWS receives/distributes reclaimed water: “The {Insert PWS name} waters sys-
tem receives/distributes reclaimed water within its service area.  Additional CCC requirements 
are listed in the permit issued in accordance with Chapter 90.46 RCW. A copy of the CCC re-
quirements pursuant to the permit is attached as part of this CCC program.”] 
 
 
E. Other Provisions 
 
1. Coordination with Local Administrative Authority  
 
Both WAC 246-290-490 and the Uniform Plumbing Code amended for Washington require 
coordination between the water purveyor and the Local Administrative Authority (LAA) in 
all matters pertaining to cross-connection control.

The Purveyor will provide a copy of this CCC program to {Insert name of LAA} via a 
copy of the Purveyor's water system plan or in a separate document.  The Purveyor will 
inform the LAA of any changes in policy or procedure that may impact the LAA. 
 
The Purveyor will provide information to the LAA in a timely manner regarding any: 
 
• 
Requirement imposed on a residential customer for the installation of a DCVA or an 
RPBA on the service, with a description of the cross-connection hazard identified;  
• 
Upgrade of the premises isolation backflow preventer, i.e., from a DCVA to an RPBA; 
• 
Action taken to discontinue water service to a customer; and 
• Backflow incident known by the Purveyor to have contaminated the public water 
system or a customer’s plumbing system. 
 
2. [Recommended Option, if no PWS/LAA written agreement exists: “Written Agreement 
with Local Administrative Authority 
 
The Purveyor will pursue development of a written agreement with the Local Administrative 
Authority regarding the details of the coordination on CCC issues between the two parties.  
The agreement will include, but not be limited to, the following items: 
 
• 
The purpose of the written agreement; 
• 
Identification of the parties and other interested agencies; 
• 
Delineation of responsibilities; 
• 
Procedures regarding new service connections; 
• 
Procedures regarding existing and changes to existing services; 
• 
Special policies and procedures, such as for fire protection and irrigation services; 
• 
Procedures regarding water service shut-offs, backflow incidents, and other events; 
•

• 
Other contingencies.”] 
 
3. [Add for Joint Program: “This CCC program has been developed in cooperation with the 
LAA for {Insert name of jurisdiction} and has been mutually agreed upon by both parties.”] 
 
4. Prohibition of Return of Used Water.  The PWS must prohibit the intentional return of used 
water to the Purveyor’s distribution system per WAC 246-290-490 (2)(l). 
 
Used water is defined as water that has left the control of the Purveyor.  This includes water 
used for heating and cooling purposes and water that may flow back into the distribution 
system from customers with multiple connections.   
 
It is the policy of the {Insert PWS name} water system to: 
 
• Prohibit the intentional return of used water to the distribution system by any customer 
served by the public water system; and  
• Require that all customers with multiple connections, where the hydraulics permit the

potential return of used water, to install a backflow preventer (DCVA or RPBA) 
commensurate with the degree of hazard at each point of connection.   
 
(Optional Additional Provisions: Purveyors may want to consider including the following 
provisions to address some common issues faced by PWSs.) 
 
5. [Recommended Optional Provision: “Unapproved Auxiliary Supplies.  All water supplies 
other than those owned by the Purveyor are considered unapproved auxiliary supplies as 
defined in WAC 246-290-010. The Purveyor will require backflow protection for customers 
with auxiliary supplies on their premises as follows:  
 
• 
Per Table 9 of WAC 246-290-490, the Purveyor will require the installation of an 
RPBA for premises isolation at the service connection to any customer having an 
unapproved auxiliary supply on the premises that is interconnected with the 
Purveyor’s water system.  [Optional more stringent approach: “ whether or not 
there is a physical connection between the unapproved auxiliary supply and the 
Purveyor’s water system.”] 
• 
[Optional Approach for Customers with Unapproved Auxiliary Water Supplies 
NOT Connected to the Purveyor’s water system, if RPBAs are only required when 
the auxiliary supply is interconnected with the Purveyor’s system per the 
paragraph directly above: “The Purveyor will require the installation of a DCVA 
for premises isolation at the service connection to any customer with an unapproved 
auxiliary water supply not interconnected with the Purveyor’s water system.”] 
 
6. [Recommended Optional Provision: “Tanker Trucks.  The Purveyor may allow tanker 
trucks to obtain water from the Purveyor’s water system under the following conditions: 
 
• 
The tanker truck is equipped with an approved AG or an approved RPBA with a 
current satisfactory inspection or test report.”] 
• 
[Optional: The tanker truck will obtain water from purveyor-designated watering 
points only.  These watering points are equipped with purveyor-installed backflow 
preventers.”] 
 
7. [Recommended Optional Provision: “Temporary Water Connections.  The Purveyor will 
not supply water through temporary connections, such as those used for construction 
projects or main disinfection, except through a backflow preventer arrangement approved 
by the Purveyor.  The applicant for the temporary connection shall document that the 
backflow preventer is a DOH-approved model and has passed an inspection and/or test 
within the past 12 months and/or upon relocation, whichever is more recent.”] 
 
8. [Recommended Optional Provision: “Interties and Wholesale Water Customers.  The 
Purveyor will require that interties with other public water systems or wholesale customers 
(such as mobile home parks) be isolated at the point of delivery by: 
 
• 
A minimum of a DCVA; and 
_____________________________________________________________________________________________ 
Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems 
March 2004 
Appendix A Page 177 
 
• 
A minimum of an RPBA if the Purveyor considers the purchasing system or 
wholesale customer to pose a high-health hazard to the Purveyor’s system.”] 
 
 
[Optional: “The Purveyor may waive or reduce the level of protection at the intertie, if the 
purchasing public water system or wholesale customer: 
 
• 
Is a Group A public water system not exempt from DOH regulation as per WAC 
246-290-020(2); 
• 
Has a CCC program that complies with WAC 246-290-490 and which has been 
approved by DOH; and 
• 
Implements the CCC program at a level satisfactory to the Purveyor.”] 
 
 
F. 
Relationship to Other Planning and Operations Program Requirements 
 
The Purveyor will consider the requirements and consequences of the CCC program on the utility’s 
planning and operations requirements.  Such considerations include, but are not limited to ensuring: 
 
• And promoting adequate communication between CCC program personnel and other wa-
ter utility staff; 
• That adequate training is provided to all staff to recognize potential cross-connection con-
trol problems; 
• That cross-connection issues be considered in water quality investigations; 
• 
That the design of the water distribution system makes adequate provisions for expected 
head losses incurred through the installation of experienced by backflow assemblies; 
• That CCC program personnel be consulted in the design of water and wastewater treat-
ment facilities and when proposals are made to receive or distribute reclaimed water; 
• That operations under normal and abnormal conditions do not result in excessive pressure 
losses; and 
• That adequate financial and administrative resources are available to carry out the CCC 
program.

Resolution No. ________ 
Cross-Connection Control Policy 
 
 
Finding of Fact 
 
Whereas it is the responsibility of a water purveyor to provide water to the customer at the meter 
that meets Washington state water quality standards; 
 
Whereas it is the water purveyor's responsibility to prevent the contamination of the public water 
system from the source of supply (i.e., to the customer's connection to the service pipe or meter); 
 
Whereas it is a requirement of the Washington State Department of Health (DOH) for the Purveyor 
to establish a cross connection-control program satisfactory to DOH;  
 
Whereas cross-connections within the customer's plumbing system pose a potential source for the 
contamination of the public water supply system; 
 
Now be it resolved that the {Insert PWS name}, hereinafter referred to as the Purveyor, establishes 
the following service policy to protect the purveyor-owned water system from the risk of 
contamination.  For public health and safety, this policy shall apply equally to all new and existing 
customers. 
 
 
Definitions 
 
Unless otherwise defined, all terms used in this resolution pertaining to cross-connection control 
have the same definitions as those contained in WAC 246-290-010 of the Washington State 
Drinking Water Regulations. 
 
Prevention of Contamination 
 
The customer's plumbing system, starting from the termination of the Purveyor's water service pipe, 
shall be considered a potential high-health hazard requiring the isolation of the customer's premises 
by a DOH-approved, customer-installed and maintained reduced-pressure principle backflow 
assembly (RPBA) or reduced-pressure detector assembly (RPDA).  The RPBA or RPDA shall be 
located at the end of the Purveyor's water service pipe (i.e., immediately downstream of the meter).  
Water shall only be supplied to the customer through a DOH-approved, customer-installed and 
maintained RPBA or RPDA.  
 
Notwithstanding the aforesaid, the Purveyor, upon an assessment of the risk of contamination posed 
by the customer's plumbing system and use of water, may allow: 
 
• 
A single-family or duplex residential customer to connect directly to the water service pipe, 
i.e., without a purveyor-approved DCVA or RPBA.  
_____________________________________________________________________________________________ 
Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems 
March 2004 
Appendix A Page 179 
 
• 
Any customer other than a single-family or duplex residential customer, as a minimum, to 
be supplied through a DOH-approved, customer-installed and maintained double-check 
valve assembly (DCVA) or double-check detector assembly (DCDA). 
• 
[Add for Combination or Joint Program: “Any customer, other than a single-family or 
duplex residential customer to connect directly to the water service pipe (i.e., without a 
purveyor-approved DCVA or RPBA), PROVIDED THAT the customer installs and 
maintains backflow preventers, at the point of hazard, that are commensurate with the 
degree of hazard assessed by the Purveyor.”] 
 
 
Conditions for Providing Service 
 
Water service is provided based on the following terms and limitations: 
 
1. The customer agrees to take all measures necessary to prevent the contamination of the 
plumbing system within his/her premises and the Purveyor's distribution system that may 
occur from backflow through a cross connection.  These measures shall include the 
prevention of backflow under any backpressure or backsiphonage condition, including the 
disruption of the water supply from the Purveyor's system that may occur during routine 
system maintenance or during emergency conditions, such as a water main break.  
 
2. The customer agrees to install, operate, and maintain at all times his plumbing system in 
compliance with the current edition of the Uniform Plumbing Code having jurisdiction as it 
pertains to the prevention of contamination and protection from thermal expansion, due to a 
closed system that could occur with the present or future installation of backflow preventers 
on the customer's service and/or at plumbing fixtures. 
3. For cross-connection control or other public health-related surveys, the customer agrees to 
provide for the Purveyor’s employees or agents free access to all parts of the premises 
during reasonable working hours of the day for routine surveys and at all times during 
emergencies. 
 
 
Where agreement for free access for the Purveyor's survey is denied, the Purveyor may 
supply water service provided that premises isolation is provided through a DOH- approved 
reduced-pressure principle backflow assembly (RPBA). 
 
4. The customer agrees to install all backflow prevention assemblies requested by the Purveyor 
and to maintain those assemblies in good working order.  The assemblies shall be of a type, 
size, and make approved by DOH and acceptable to the Purveyor.  The assemblies shall be 
installed in accordance with the recommendations given in the most recently published 
edition of the Cross Connection Control Manual, Accepted Procedures and Practice, 
published by the Pacific Northwest Section, American Water Works Association, or latest 
edition thereof. [Optional Wording: “The assemblies shall be installed in accordance with 
the Purveyor’s construction standards and specifications.”] 
5. The customer agrees to:  
_____________________________________________________________________________________________ 
Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems 
March 2004 
Appendix A Page 180 
 
 
(a) 
Have all assemblies (e.g., RPBAs and/or DCVAs) that the Purveyor relies upon to 
protect the public water distribution system tested upon installation, annually 
thereafter and/or more frequently if requested by the Purveyor, after repair, and after 
relocation;  
(b) 
Have all testing done by a purveyor-approved and currently DOH-certified Backflow 
Assembly Tester (BAT);  
(c) 
Have the RPBA or DCVA tested in accordance with DOH-approved test procedures; 
and  
(d) 
Submit to the Purveyor the results of the test(s) on Purveyor-supplied test report forms 
within the time period specified by the Purveyor.  
 
 
6. The customer agrees to bear all costs for the aforementioned installation, testing, repair, 
maintenance and replacement of the RPBA, RPDA, DCVA or DCDA installed to protect 
the Purveyor's distribution system. 
 
7. At the time of application for service, if required by the Purveyor, the customer agrees to 
submit to the Purveyor plumbing plans and/or a cross-connection control survey of the 
premises conducted by a purveyor-approved and DOH-certified Cross-Connection Con-
trol Specialist (CCS).  
 
The cross-connection control survey shall assess the cross-connection hazards and list the 
backflow preventers provided within the premises.  The results of the survey shall be 
submitted prior to the Purveyor turning on water service to a new customer.  The cost of 
the survey shall be borne by the customer.  
 
8. For classes of customers other than single-family residential, when required by the 
Purveyor, the customer agrees to periodically submit a cross-connection control re-survey of 
the premises by a DOH-certified CCS acceptable to the Purveyor.  The Purveyor may 
require the re-survey to be performed in response to changes in the customer's plumbing or 
water use, or performed periodically (annually or less frequently) where the Purveyor 
considers the customer's plumbing system to be complex or subject to frequent changes in 
water use.  The cost of the re-survey shall be borne by the customer.   
 
9. Within 30 days of a request by the Purveyor, a residential customer shall agree to complete 
and submit to the Purveyor a "Water Use Questionnaire" for the purpose of surveying the 
health hazard posed by the customer's plumbing system on the Purveyor's distribution 
system.  Further, the residential customer agrees to provide within 30 days of a request by 
the Purveyor a cross-connection control survey of the premises by a DOH-certified CCS 
acceptable to the Purveyor.  
 
10. The customer agrees to obtain the prior approval from the Purveyor for all changes in water 
use, and alterations and additions to the plumbing system, and shall comply with any 
additional requirements imposed by the Purveyor for cross-connection control. 
11. The customer agrees to immediately notify the Purveyor and the local health jurisdiction of 
_____________________________________________________________________________________________ 
Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems 
March 2004 
Appendix A Page 181 
 
any backflow incident occurring within the customer’s premises (i.e., entry of any 
contaminant/pollutant into the drinking water) and shall cooperate fully with the Purveyor to 
determine the reason for the backflow incident.  
 
12. The customer acknowledges the right of the Purveyor to discontinue the water supply within 
72 hours of giving notice to the customer, or a lesser period of time if required to protect 
public health, if the customer fails to cooperate with the Purveyor in the survey of premises, 
in the installation, maintenance, repair, inspection, or testing of backflow prevention 
assemblies or air gaps required by the Purveyor, or in the Purveyor's effort to contain a 
contaminant or pollutant that is detected in the customer's system.  
 
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in lieu of discontinuing water service, the 
Purveyor may install an RPBA on the service pipe to provide premises isolation, and 
recover all costs for the installation and subsequent maintenance and repair of the assembly, 
appurtenances, and enclosure from the customer as fees and charges for water.  The failure 
of the customer to pay these fees and charges may result in termination of water service in 
accordance with the Purveyor's water billing policies. 
 
13. [Add for Combination or Joint Program: “The Purveyor will require premises isolation for 
a customer that is of the high-hazard type or category requiring "Mandatory Premises 
Isolation" established by the DOH regulations (Table 9, WAC 246-290-490).”] 
 
14. Where the Purveyor imposes mandatory premises isolation in compliance with DOH 
regulations, or agrees to the customer's voluntary premises isolation through the installation 
of a RPBA immediately downstream of the Purveyor's water meter, the customer 
acknowledges his obligation to comply with the other cross-connection control regulations 
having jurisdiction (i.e., Uniform Plumbing Code).  Although the Purveyor's requirements 
for installation, testing, and repair of backflow assemblies may be limited to the RPBAs 
used for premises isolation, the customer agrees to the other terms herein as a condition of 
allowing a direct connection to the Purveyor's service pipe. 
 
15. The customer agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Purveyor for all contamination of 
the customer's plumbing system or the Purveyor's distribution system that results from an 
unprotected or inadequately protected cross connection within the customer’s premises.  
This indemnification shall pertain to all backflow conditions that may arise from the 
Purveyor's suspension of water supply or reduction of water pressure, recognizing that the 
air gap separation otherwise required would require the customer to provide adequate 
facilities to collect, store, and pump water for his/her premises. 
 
16. The customer agrees that, in the event legal action is required and commenced between the 
Purveyor and the customer to enforce the terms and conditions herein, the substantially 
prevailing party shall be entitled to reimbursement of all incurred costs and expenses 
including, but not limited to, reasonable attorney's fees as determined by the Court. 
 
17. The customer acknowledges that the Purveyor's survey of a customer's premises is for the 
_____________________________________________________________________________________________ 
Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems 
March 2004 
Appendix A Page 182 
 
sole purpose of establishing the Purveyor's minimum requirements for the protection of the 
public water supply system, commensurate with the Purveyor's assessment of the degree of 
hazard.   
 
It shall not be assumed by the customer or any regulatory agency that the Purveyor's survey, 
requirements for the installation of backflow prevention assemblies, lack of requirements for 
the installation of backflow prevention assemblies, or other actions by the Purveyor’s 
personnel constitute an approval of the customer's plumbing system or an assurance to the 
customer of the absence of cross connections therein. 
 
18. The customer acknowledges the right of the Purveyor, in keeping with changes to 
Washington State regulations, industry standards, or the Purveyor's risk management 
policies, to impose retroactive requirements for additional cross-connection control 
measures. 
 
The Purveyor will record the customer's agreement to the above terms for service on an 
“Application for Water Service,” “Application for Change of Water Service,” or other such form 
prepared by the Purveyor and signed by the customer.  
 
 
Implementation of the Cross-Connection Control Policy 
 
The Purveyor will engage the services of a DOH-certified CCS to develop, implement and be in 
responsible charge of the {Insert PWS name} Water System’s cross-connection control program. 
 
The Purveyor, under the direction of the aforementioned CCS, will prepare a written cross-
connection control program plan to implement the requirements of this resolution.  The written 
program shall be consistent with this resolution and shall comply with the requirements of Chapter 
246-290 WAC (Group A Drinking Water Regulations). 
 
The Purveyor will use the most recently published editions of the following publications as 
references and technical aids: 
 
1. Cross-Connection Control Manual, Accepted Procedures and Practice, published by the 
Pacific Northwest Section, American Water Works Association, or latest edition thereof. 
 
2. Manual of Cross-Connection Control, published by the Foundation for Cross-Connection 
Control and Hydraulic Research, University of Southern California, or latest edition thereof. 
 
3. Cross-Connection Control Guidance Manual for Small Water Systems, published by the 
DOH Office of Drinking Water. 
 
4. [Optional addition:  add additional references here, if applicable]. 
 
The Purveyor will incorporate the written program plan into the Water System Plan [Alternative, if 
_____________________________________________________________________________________________ 
Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems 
March 2004 
Appendix A Page 183 
 
WSP is not required: “Small Water System Management Program”] and will submit the plan to 
DOH for approval when requested. 
 
The Purveyor, in consultation with the aforementioned CCS, shall have the authority to make 
reasonable decisions related to cross connections in cases and situations not provided for in the 
resolution or written program. 
 
If any provision in this resolution, or in the written cross-connection control program is found to 
be less stringent than or inconsistent with the Drinking Water Regulations (Chapter 246-290 
WAC), or other Washington state statutes or rules, the more stringent state statute, rule, or regu-
lation shall apply.

Appendix B 
Example Cross-Connection Control Program 
for a Non-Community System 
 
 
Contents 
 
Appendix B contains an example written cross-connection control (CCC) program plan and an 
example legal instrument for a non-community system.   
 
 
How to Use Appendix B 
 
The documents in Appendix B have been arranged and formatted for ease of review by the 
Washington State Department of Health (DOH) when it evaluates the CCC program with respect 
to the regulations.  Therefore, DOH recommends that purveyors follow the format (i.e., use as a 
template) whenever possible.  However, public water systems are not required to use the exam-
ple program and legal instrument.  DOH recognizes that some PWSs may have a particular ap-
proach or institutional requirements that may dictate a different format or wording in the written 
program. 
 
 
Description of Typical Non-Community Systems 
 
The majority of non-community water systems, in addition to the definitions in the Drinking Water 
Regulations, Chapter 246-290 WAC, have the following characteristics: 
 
• 
The water system owner (purveyor) serves his/her own facilities; and 
• 
The consumers are the occupants or users (employees, students, patrons, visitors, etc.) of the 
facilities.   
 
 
Examples of Non-Community Water Systems 
 
Non-community water systems of this type include, but are not limited to: 
 
• 
Schools, colleges, day care centers, and similar institutions; 
• 
Clinics, hospitals, public parks, golf courses, fairgrounds, and playgrounds; 
• 
Hotels, motels, resorts, campgrounds, RV parks and highway rest areas; 
• 
Businesses such as stores, nurseries, service stations, restaurants and laundromats; and  
• 
Industrial plants, food processing facilities, shellfish processors, and temporary farm worker 
housing.

Appendix B 
Page 185 
 
Community Systems with Non-Community System Characteristics 
 
Some community water systems have characteristics similar to non-community systems, i.e., the 
water system owner (purveyor) serves his/her own facilities, and the consumers are the occupants or 
users of the facilities.    
 
Examples of such community systems are those that serve long-term occupants such as: 
 
• 
Educational institutions with dormitories or student and staff residences; 
• 
Nursing homes, retirement centers and mental institutions; 
• 
Correctional institutions such as prisons; 
• 
Mobile home parks and apartment complexes; and 
• 
Military bases with barracks or other personnel housing. 
 
For CCC program purposes, community systems with non-community system characteristics, such 
as the examples listed above, should develop and implement a program similar to the example CCC 
program for non-community water systems provided in this Appendix.  
 
 
Non-Community Systems with Community System Characteristics  
 
Some non-community water systems may have both non-community and community systems 
characteristics.  For example, some non-community systems serve developments where there is a 
mix of recreational and residential connections.  In this example, the Purveyor owns the recreational 
facilities, but the residential connections are privately owned.   
 
Non-community systems with characteristics of community and non-community systems should 
base their written programs primarily on Appendix B.  However, the relevant elements of Appendix 
A (or the DOH Very Small Water System CCC Guidance) should be incorporated into the 
Appendix B program plan where applicable (to address CCC issues for the non-purveyor owned 
connections).   
 
 
Instructions 
 
To use the example program plan, non-community water systems are encouraged to: 
 
1. Copy the example program file into Word (download from the web-site or obtain from 
DOH electronically); 
2. Retain the basic formatting and text of the example program and fill in the blanks, deci-
sion table and check boxes where indicated to “customize” the example program;  
3. Include or delete optional and/or additional language shown in the example program to 
reflect system-specific decisions; and 
4. Insert the completed written CCC program in the Small Water System Management Pro-
gram (SWSMP) or Water System Plan (WSP).

A.  
Requirement for Program 
 
The {Insert PWS name and ID number} hereinafter referred to as “the Purveyor”, has the 
responsibility to protect the public water systems from contamination due to cross connections.  A 
cross connection may be defined as "Any actual or potential physical connection between a potable 
water line and any pipe, vessel, or machine that contains or has a probability of containing a non-
potable gas or liquid, such that it is possible for a non-potable gas or liquid to enter the potable 
water system by backflow.” 
 
 
All public water systems are required to develop and implement cross-connection control (CCC) 
programs.  The CCC requirements are contained in WAC 246-290-490 of the Group A Drinking 
Water Regulations.  The minimum required elements of a CCC program are as follows: 
 
1. Establishment of legal authority and program policies; 
2. Evaluation of premises for cross-connection hazards; 
3. Elimination and/or control of cross connections; 
4. Provision of qualified personnel; 
5. Inspection and testing of backflow preventers; 
6. Quality control of testing process; 
7. Response to backflow incidents; 
8. Public education for consumers; 
9. Record keeping for CCC program; and 
10. Special requirements for reclaimed water use. 
 
Other requirements of a CCC program include: 
 
1. Coordination with the Local Administrative Authority (LAA), i.e. the local building or 
plumbing official, regarding CCC activities;  
2. Inclusion of a written CCC program in a WSP or SWSMP; and 
3. Prohibition of the intentional return of used water. 
 
 
B. 
Program Objectives 
 
The objectives of the CCC program are to: 
 
1. 
Reasonably reduce the risk of contamination of the source of supply and water distribution 
system; and 
 
_____________________________________________________________________________________________ 
Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems

Summary of Program Decisions 
 
The following table summarizes the major policy and program decisions adopted for the {Insert 
PWS name} Water System.  [Since the Purveyor and the “customer” are the same entity in a non-
community system, only a limited number of program decisions are needed.  For each program 
area, the table shows some available options for decisions that are likely to be required for a non-
community system.  {The PWS should mark the option selected by checking the appropriate 
boxes under “Decision” in the following table.}]

The following program element descriptions are excerpts from the CCC regulations found inWAC 
246-290-490. 
 
 
Element 1: 
Adoption of a written legal instrument authorizing the establishment and 
implementation of a CCC program. 
 
Authority - The Purveyor is the owner and operator of all facilities on the premises.  By stated 
policy [Alternate Wording if Applicable: “ resolution by the {Insert name of governing 
body}”], the Purveyor is authorized and mandated to protect the water system from 
contamination via cross connections.  A copy of the stated policy or resolution is included as part 
of this CCC program. 
 
 
Element 2: 
Development and implementation of procedures and schedules for evaluating new 
and existing service connections to assess the degree of hazard. 
 
Cross-Connection Hazard Assessments 
 
1. Initial Hazard Assessment  
 
a. Existing Facilities/Systems - The Purveyor will ensure that a DOH certified cross-
connection control specialist (CCS) conducts an initial cross-connection hazard 
evaluation of the {Insert PWS name} Water System within six months after adoption of 
this CCC program. 
 
Program Adoption Date:____________ Initial Hazard Survey Date:_____________ 
 
b. New Facilities/Systems – The Purveyor will ensure that a DOH-certified CCS conducts 
an initial cross-connection hazard evaluation, before water service is provided to any 
new facilities, irrigation systems etc. served by the water system.  
 
2. Periodic Resurveys – The Purveyor will ensure that a DOH-certified CCS periodically 
resurveys for cross-connection hazards the {Insert PWS name} Water System.  Resurveys 
will be conducted: 
 
a. Every 2 years after the initial hazard survey {insert alternate frequency if appropriate}; 
and  
 
b. Upon any changes in use of the premises, plumbing or distribution facilities.

Element 3: 
Development and implementation of procedures and schedules for elimination 
and/or control of cross connections. 
 
Policy - The following procedures apply to all new and existing buildings or areas of water use in 
the {Insert PWS name} Water System: 
 
1. Mandatory Premises Isolation for High-hazard Buildings, Facilities or Systems – The 
Purveyor will ensure that water services to all buildings, facilities or systems of the type 
described in Table 9 of WAC 246-290-490 (i.e., high hazard) are isolated by a DOH-
approved reduced pressure backflow assembly (RPBA). 
 
2. Compliance with Uniform Plumbing Code/Additional Premises Isolation Requirements – 
The Purveyor will ensure that all buildings or areas of water use: 
 
a. Comply with the current plumbing code (amended for Washington) adopted by the State 
Building Code Council; and 
 
b. [Purveyor’s Optional Additional Language “Be isolated with an approved double 
check valve assembly (DCVA), where the CCS believes the plumbing code does not 
provide protection commensurate with the assessed degree of hazard.”] 
 
3. Plumbing/Water System Design – The Purveyor will ensure that the design of the plumbing 
and/or water system incorporates DOH-approved backflow prevention assemblies 
appropriate for the degree of hazard assessed by the Purveyor’s CCS.  Initial 
plumbing/water system design and subsequent design modifications will be subject to 
review by a DOH-certified CCS for cross-connection hazards.   
 
4. Approved Backflow Assemblies - The Purveyor will ensure that DOH-approved backflow 
prevention assemblies protect the public water system from contamination.  DOH-approved 
assemblies are assemblies that appear on DOH's published list of Backflow Prevention 
Assemblies Approved for Installation in Washington State.  The Purveyor will keep on file 
documentation regarding the approval status of all backflow assemblies installed to protect 
the public water system.   
 
5. Installation Standards – The Purveyor will ensure that all approved backflow preventers are 
installed in: 
 
• The orientation for which they are approved; 
• A manner and location that facilitates their proper operation, maintenance, and testing 
or inspection, and in compliance with safety regulations; 
• A manner and location that protects them from flooding and freezing; and 
• Accordance with the installation standards outlined in the most recently published 
editions of the PNWS-AWWA Cross-Connection Control Manual, or the USC-
FCCCHR Manual Of Cross-Connection Control, unless the manufacturer’s require-
ments are more stringent.

2. Prohibition of Return of Used Water: The water system must prohibit the intentional return 
of used water to the Purveyor’s distribution system per WAC 246-290-490 (2)(d). 
 
a. Definition - Used water is defined as water that has left the control of the Purveyor.   
 
b. Used Water Policies - Since the Purveyor owns both the water supply facilities and the 
plumbing systems, the water has not, technically, left the control of the Purveyor.  
However, for protection of the drinking water quality and the health of the 
employees/building occupants, the Purveyor will institute the following policies: 
 
• 
Plumbing design or changes will not allow water that has been used for such 
purposes as heating or cooling to be returned to the drinking water system; and 
 
• 
Buildings and facilities with two or more water service connections that are 
internally connected such as to provide a flow–through condition will have each 
service isolated by either an RPBA or DCVA, depending upon the level of hazard 
assessed by the Purveyor’s CCS. 
 
 
F. 
Relationship to Other Planning and Program Operations 
 
The Purveyor will consider the impacts of the CCC program upon the planning and operations 
requirements of the {Insert PWS name} Water System.  Such considerations include, but are not 
limited to, ensuring that: 
 
1. The design of the water distribution system (and plumbing system) provides for expected 
head losses resulting from installation of backflow assemblies; 
2. CCC program personnel are consulted in the design of water and wastewater treatment 
facilities and when proposals are made to receive or distribute reclaimed water; 
3. Operations under normal and abnormal conditions do not result in excessive pressure 
losses; 
4. Cross-connection issues are considered in water quality investigations; and 
5. Adequate financial and administrative resources are provided to carry out the CCC pro-
gram.

Legal Instrument for a Non-community Water System CCC Program 
 
Background 
 
Where the Purveyor owns both the public water system and the facilities served by the water sys-
tem (i.e., the plumbing systems up to the free-flowing tap), the Purveyor may already have the 
legal authority to establish a CCC program.  Proprietors of restaurants or small businesses that 
have their own water systems are examples where the legal authority already exists.  In such 
cases, the Purveyor may not require a formal legal instrument, but only a declaration of owner-
ship of the system and facilities served and the intent to establish and implement a CCC program 
consistent with WAC 246-290-490. 
 
In other cases, such as school districts, it may be necessary for the governing body (such as the 
School Board) to adopt a resolution or similar document to establish the authority and intent to 
adopt and implement a CCC program.  For this reason, a sample resolution for a non-community 
water system is presented below.

Finding of Fact: 
 
Whereas it is the responsibility of a water purveyor to provide water that meets Washington State 
water quality standards to all consumers occupying or visiting the Purveyor’s premises; 
 
Whereas it is the water purveyor's responsibility to prevent the contamination of the public water 
system from the source of supply (i.e., to the customer's connection to the service pipe or meter); 
 
Whereas the Purveyor also owns the facilities and the plumbing systems that deliver the water to the 
consumers;  
 
Whereas it is a requirement of the Washington State Department of Health for the Purveyor to 
establish a cross-connection control program satisfactory to DOH; 
 
Now be it resolved that the {Insert PWS name}, hereinafter referred to as “the Purveyor”, 
establishes the following policy to protect the Purveyor-owned water system and plumbing facilities 
from the risk of contamination.  For public health and safety, this policy shall apply equally to all 
new and existing facilities. 
 
 
 
A.  Definitions 
 
Unless otherwise defined, all terms used in this resolution pertaining to cross-connection control 
have the same definitions as those contained in WAC 246-290-010 of the Washington State 
Drinking Water Regulations and Chapter 2 of the Uniform Plumbing Code as amended for 
Washington State (Chapter 51-56 WAC). 
 
 
B.  Administrative Provisions 
 
1. The Purveyor shall engage the services of a Department of Health (DOH) certified cross-
connection control specialist (CCS), by employment or by contract, to develop, implement, 
and be in responsible charge of the {{Insert PWS name} Water System’s CCC program. 
 
2. The Purveyor, under the direction of the CCS as provided for in B-1, shall prepare a written

Appendix C 
Backflow Incident Response Plan  
for a Small Water System 
 
 
A.  
General 
 
This Backflow Incident Response Plan should be considered a supplement to the Purveyor’s 
Emergency Plan. 
 
Purveyors should immediately begin a backflow incident investigation whenever the initial 
evaluation of a water quality complaint indicates that: 
 
1. A backflow incident has occurred (i.e., drinking water supply has been contaminated) or 
may have occurred; or  
 
2. The complaint can’t be explained as a "normal" aesthetic problem.   
 
Also, whenever a water main break (or power outage for pumped systems) causes a widespread loss 
of water pressure in the system (creating backsiphonage conditions), purveyors should initiate a 
check of distribution system water quality as a precursor to the need for a backflow incident 
investigation.   
 
WAC 246-290-490 requires purveyors to notify DOH, the Local Administrative Authority and local 
health jurisdiction as soon as possible, but no later than the end of the next business day when a 
backflow incident contaminates the potable water supply (in the distribution system and/or in the 
customer's plumbing system).  Purveyors should include a list of emergency contact telephone 
numbers at the beginning of the water system’s O & M Manual, so that the information is readily 
available when an incident occurs. 
 
A backflow incident investigation is often a team effort.  The investigation should be made by or 
initially led by the DOH-certified Cross-Connection Control Specialist employed by the Purveyor.  
The investigation team may include state health (regional) staff, local health personnel and/or local 
plumbing inspectors. 
 
Purveyors can get more detailed guidance on how to respond to a backflow incident from the

Short List of Tasks 
 
Small water system purveyors can use the following short list of tasks as initial guidance for dealing 
with backflow incidents.  Purveyors should consult the most recently published edition of the 
PNWS-AWWA Backflow Incident Investigation Procedures Manual referenced above for greater 
detail as soon as possible after learning of a possible or confirmed backflow incident.  Note: the 
water system is referred to as the Purveyor in the short task list. 
 
1. Customer Notification   
 
a. As soon as possible, the Purveyor will notify customers not to consume or use water. 
 
b. The Purveyor will start the notification with the customers nearest in location to the 
assumed source of contamination (usually the customer(s) making the water quality 
complaint). 
 
c. The Purveyor will inform the customer about the reason for the backflow incident 
investigation and the Purveyor's efforts to restore water quality as soon as possible. The 
Purveyor will let the customer know that customers will be informed when they may use 
water, the need to boil water used for consumption until a satisfactory bacteriological 
test result is obtained from the lab, etc.  
 
d. Where a customer cannot be contacted immediately, the Purveyor will place a written 
notice on the front door handle, and a follow-up visit will be made to confirm that the 
customer received notice about the possible contamination of the water supply. 
 
e. When dealing with a backflow incident, the Purveyor will let customers know that it 
could take several days to identify the source and type of contaminant(s) and to clean 
and disinfect the distribution system.  
 
2. Identification of Source of Contamination   
 
a. The Purveyor will give consideration to the distribution system as a potential source of 
the contaminant (e.g., air valve inlet below ground). 
 
b. The Purveyor will not start flushing the distribution system until the source of 
contamination is identified (flushing may aggravate the backflow situation, and will 
likely remove the contaminant before a water sample can be collected to fully identify 
the contaminant). 
 
c. The Purveyor will conduct a house-to-house survey to search for the source of 
contamination and the extent that the contaminant has spread through the distribution 
system.  Note: a check of water meters may show a return of water (meter running 
backward) to the distribution system.

Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems 
March 2004 
Appendix C 
Page 204 
 
d. When the cross connection responsible for the system contamination is located, the 
Purveyor should discontinue water service to that customer, until the customer 
completes the corrective action ordered by the Purveyor. 
 
3. Isolation of Contaminated Portion of System   
 
a. The Purveyor will isolate the portions of the system that are suspected of being 
contaminated by closing isolating valves; leave one valve open to ensure that positive 
water pressure is maintained throughout the isolated system.  
 
b. The Purveyor will be sure to notify all affected customers in the isolated area first and 
then notify other customers served by the system.  
 
4. Public Health Impacts   
 
a. The Purveyor will seek immediate input from and work with state and local health 
agencies to accurately communicate and properly mitigate potential health effects 
resulting from the backflow incident. 
 
b. If appropriate, the Purveyor will refer customers that may have consumed the 
contaminant or had their household (or commercial) plumbing systems contaminated to 
public health personnel and Local Administrative Authorities (plumbing inspectors). 
 
5. Cleaning/Disinfecting the Distribution System  
 
a. The Purveyor will develop and implement a program for cleaning the contaminated 
distribution system consistent with the contaminant(s) identified. 
 
b. Where both chemical and bacteriological contamination has occurred, the Purveyor will 
disinfect the system after the removal of the chemical contaminant. 
 
c. Where any bacteriological contamination is suspected, the Purveyor will provide field 
disinfection.   
 
 
C.  Additional Information on Cleaning/Disinfecting the Distribution System 
 
Most chemical or physical contaminants can be flushed from the water distribution system or 
customer's plumbing system with adequate flushing velocity.  However, this may not be the case in 
systems where scale and corrosion deposits (e.g., tuberculation on old cast iron mains) provide a 
restriction to obtaining adequate flushing velocity, or where chemical deposits or bacteriological 
slimes (biofilm) are present (on which the chemical contaminant may adhere). 
 
_______________________________________________________________________________________________ 
Cross-Connection Control for Small Water Systems 
March 2004 
Appendix C 
Page 205 
 
To remove a chemical or physical contaminant from the distribution system, purveyors may need 
to: 
 
1.  Physically clean the affected area using foam swabs (pigs); and/or  
 
2. Alter the form of the chemical contaminant (e.g., through oxidation using chlorination or 
addition of detergents). 
 
When adding any chemical (including chlorine) to remove a contaminant from the distribution 
system, it is essential that the Purveyor fully understand the chemistry of the contaminant.  Adding 
the wrong chemical could make the contaminant more toxic to customers and/or more 
difficult to remove from the distribution system. 
 
To disinfect water mains using the "slug" or "continuous flow" method, a field unit should be used 
for chlorine injection, such as a chemical feed - metering or proportioning pump for sodium 
hypochlorite.  Purveyors should contact the appropriate DOH regional office to discuss proposed 
approaches to contaminant removal and disinfection prior to taking corrective action.

Backflow Assembly Testers Pre-Approved for 
Submitting Test Reports to the {Insert PWS name} 
{Insert date here} 
 
 
The following table lists Backflow Assembly Testers (BATs) that are pre-approved to test backflow 
assemblies in our water system’s service area.  We compiled the list by identifying individual testers who 
requested to work in this area or who previously submitted properly completed test reports to our system.  
{Optional language: An asterisk (*) denotes BATs that are also DOH-certified Cross-Connection Control 
Specialists (CCSs).}  Note: listing does not constitute an endorsement of these BATs by our system or a 
certification of the quality of services they provide.  
 
To appear on our pre-approved BAT list, the tester must: 
 
• 
Show proof of current BAT certification from DOH;  
• 
Submit documentation that his/her assembly test equipment has been verified for accuracy within the last 12 
months and calibrated if needed; and 
• 
{Optional language: Meet other criteria established by our system including____________________ {insert 
additional requirements here such as business licenses, etc.} 
 
As an alternative to the above, pre-approved testers must document that they appear on the approved BAT list of 
another nearby water system that has a testing QA/QC program acceptable to our system. 
 
WAC 246-290-490 requires a DOH-certified BAT to test all assemblies (RPBA, RPDA, DCVA, etc.) that protect the 
distribution system.  Assemblies that protect the public water system must be tested in accordance with DOH-
approved field test procedures: 
 
• 
Upon installation, and annually thereafter;  
• 
After repair, reinstallation, or relocation; and 
• 
After a backflow incident.  
 
Note: the DOH BAT certification is a special certification separate from other waterworks operator certification 
categories, plumbing licenses, contractor registration, etc.  Other licenses, certifications and/or registrations may be 
required to install backflow prevention assemblies and/or perform maintenance work on assemblies within buildings. 
However, only a currently DOH-certified BAT may test the assemblies that protect the public water system 
from contamination.

Backflow Incident Report Form 
 
Many backflow incidents occur that are not reported.  This is usually because: 
 
• 
The incidents are of short duration; 
• 
The incidents are not detected; 
• 
Neither the customer nor the Purveyor realizes that a contamination was caused by a backflow 
incident; 
• 
The customer is not aware the incident should be reported;  
• 
Customers do not know who to report the incidents to; and/or 
• 
Liability concerns on the part of either the customer or purveyor or both. 
 
DOH and the PNWS-AWWA Cross-Connection Control Committee are making an effort to bring 
backflow incidents to the attention of water purveyors, Local Administrative Authorities, legislators, and 
the general public.  If you have any knowledge of a backflow incident, please fill out a copy of the 
Backflow Incident Report Form and return it to DOH and the PNWS-AWWA CCC committee.

Dear ________ Water System Customer: 
 
Washington State drinking water regulations, WAC 246-290-490, require public water systems to develop and 
implement cross-connection control programs.  Cross-connection control programs help protect public health by 
preventing contamination of the drinking water as it is delivered to water system customers.  The attached brochure 
explains what a cross connection is, describes typical household cross connections and what you can do to help 
protect your drinking water.   
 
As part of our efforts to keep your drinking water safe, we are conducting a cross-connection control hazard survey 
of residential customers served by our system.  The purpose of the survey is to help us determine if any of our 
residential customers have special plumbing or activities on their premises that could increase the risk of 
contamination to our water system.   
 
For most residential customers, the cross-connection control hazard posed to the public water system is minimal.  
This is because your household plumbing was installed in compliance with the Uniform Plumbing Code.  The 
Uniform Plumbing Code generally provides adequate protection of your water potable water piping and our public 
water distribution system from cross connections.  However, a few customers with special plumbing or activities on 
their premises may pose an increased health risk to other customers served by our system.  These customers may 
need to have a backflow preventer installed on their service lines or provide alternate protection to prevent 
contamination of the public water system. 
 
Please complete the attached questionnaire by checking the applicable boxes on the table; and  
return the completed, signed questionnaire by {insert date} to the address shown on the letterhead {or insert 
address if different}.            
 
Thanks in advance for filling out the questionnaire.  We appreciate your cooperation in helping us to protect the 
drinking water we deliver to our customers.   If you have any questions about the survey or how to fill out the 
questionnaire, please contact me at {insert phone number}.  We will review your questionnaire and determine 
whether we need to contact your for further information.

Dear ________ Water System Customer: 
 
Washington State drinking water regulations, WAC 246-290-490, require public water systems to develop and 
implement cross-connection control programs.  Cross-connection control programs protect public health by 
preventing contamination of the drinking water supply.  The attached brochure explains what a cross connection is 
and what you can do to help protect your drinking water. 
 
As part of the cross-connection control program, our system must assess the degree of hazard posed by each of our 
customer's plumbing systems upon the public water system.  Non-residential customers and multi-family residential 
customers pose a special concern, because of the greater scope and complexity of their plumbing systems, special 
uses of water on the premises (e.g., manufacturing), fire protection systems, etc.  Depending on the hazard 
assessment results, you may need to have a backflow preventer installed on your service line or provide alternate 
protection. 
 
A cross-connection survey needs to be conducted for us to make the hazard assessment for your premises.  
The drinking water regulations require a person with special training, i.e., a Department of Health certified Cross-
Connection Specialist (CCS), to conduct the surveys.  Our system’s policy is to have surveys of all non-residential 
premises and multi-family residential premises conducted by a CCS employed by the customer.  Survey results must 
be submitted to our system for review. 
 
Please arrange for the attached survey form to be completed and returned to this office by {insert date}.  A 
list of local CCSs who provide this type of service is attached. 
 
We appreciate your cooperation in meeting this hazard survey requirement.  If you have any questions, please 
contact me at {insert phone number}.

Dear ________ Water System Customer: 
 
Washington State drinking water regulations, WAC 246-290-490, require public water systems to develop and 
implement cross-connection control programs.  Cross-connection control programs protect public health by 
preventing contamination of the drinking water as it is delivered to people served by the water system.  The 
purpose of this letter is to inform you of a requirement to install a backflow assembly. 
 
Our water system’s policy considers each of our customer’s plumbing systems, starting from the termination of the 
service pipe downstream of the water meter, to pose a potential cross-connection hazard to the public water system.  
Our policy requires a backflow prevention assembly commensurate with the degree of hazard to be installed on the 
service line.  The purpose of this backflow prevention assembly is to isolate your plumbing system from the water 
distribution system.  We’ve attached a copy of Resolution {insert number} describing our cross-connection control 
policy.   
 
We have received the cross-connection control survey report submitted by your Cross-Connection Control 
Specialist (CCS).  The survey assessed the overall public health hazard posed by your plumbing system (and water 
use) to the public water system.  We agree with the assessment made by the CCS.  Based on the assessment, a 
Department of Health-approved {insert type of assembly} is required to be installed on your service line (at a 
location downstream of the water meter).   
 
Please make arrangements for the assembly to be installed by {insert date} or when your plumbing system is 
modified, whichever comes sooner.  {Optional language: We realize that this expense was not anticipated, so if you 
are unable to comply with this deadline, please contact us to discuss an alternative date}.  We’ve enclosed a copy of 
our standard installation drawings for this type of assembly.  Your CCS should oversee the installation of the 
assembly to ensure compliance with these standards. 
 
We appreciate your cooperation in this matter.  If you have any questions, please contact me at {insert phone 
number}. 
 
Sincerely,

Dear ________ Water System Customer: 
 
Washington State drinking water regulations, WAC 246-290-490, require public water systems to develop and 
implement cross-connection control programs to protect the drinking water supply from contamination.  As part of 
this program, backflow prevention assemblies have been installed on your water service(s) and/or within your 
plumbing system to protect our water distribution system.  Annual testing is required to ensure that the backflow 
prevention assemblies properly function. 
 
The purpose of this letter is to request that you now arrange for the annual testing of the reduced pressure principle 
(RPBA), double check valve (DCVA), and/or pressure vacuum breaker (PVBA or SVBA) assembly/assemblies 
described on the attached list.  A Washington State Department of Health certified backflow assembly tester (BAT) 
must conduct the testing.  Testing results should be sent to the address above and submitted by {insert date}. 
 
For your convenience, we are enclosing a list of backflow assembly testers pre-approved to test assemblies that 
protect our water system.  Test report forms are also enclosed.  The test report forms need to be properly completed 
by the BAT, signed by the customer/assembly owner, and returned to us. 
 
Note: the Uniform Plumbing Code in effect in Washington also requires annual assembly testing.  In addition to the 
testing required for the assemblies that protect the public water system (i.e., identified on the attached list), you may 
wish to have all of the remaining assemblies within your premises tested at this time.   
 
If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at {insert phone number}.

Dear ________ Water System Customer: 
 
Washington State drinking water regulations, WAC 246-290-490, require public water systems to implement cross-
connection control programs to protect the drinking water supply from contamination.  As part of this program, 
backflow prevention assemblies were installed on your service or within your premises to protect our water 
distribution system from contamination.  The WAC requires these assemblies to be tested annually to verify that 
they are in good working condition. 
 
The assembly/assemblies identified in our letter of {insert date} (copy attached) must be tested by a Department of 
Health certified Backflow Assembly Tester (BAT) upon installation and annually thereafter.  This requirement is a 
condition of our system continuing to supply potable water to your premises.  According to our records, as of 
today’s date, you have not submitted the requested Assembly Test Report(s).  If you believe this is in error, 
please contact me as soon as possible at the number below. 
 
If you have not submitted the Assembly Test Reports as requested, please: 
• 
Immediately employ a DOH-certified BAT to test the listed assembly/assemblies; and 
• 
Submit a signed copy of the completed Assembly Test Report(s) to me at the address above within 15 days 
of the date of this letter. 
 
Your cooperation in this matter is essential for protecting your drinking water supply and the public water supply 
from contamination.  Failure to comply with the annual assembly testing requirement will trigger an enforcement 
action by our system.  Enforcement could include a shut-off of your water service. 
 
If you have any questions, please contact me at {insert phone number}.

Annual Summary Report Forms 
 
Appendix E contains sample cross-connection control (CCC) Annual Summary Report forms.  
Per WAC 246-290-490, purveyors are required to complete these forms to report information on 
the status of a public water system’s CCC program and implementation activities.  When the 
Department of Health sends out hard copies or electronic copies of the forms, they are color-
coded.  Purveyors often refer to the forms by color instead of name.  The respective color of each 
form is noted below. 
 
The three forms are: 
 
1. Cross-Connection Control Activities Annual Summary Report   
 
Purveyors use this form to report (for a calendar year) their CCC implementation 
activities, such as status of high-hazard premises protection, backflow preventer 
inventory/testing information, and hazard evaluations.  This is the “blue form.” 
 
2. Cross-Connection Control Program Summary Report   
 
This form is use to report the type, policies, and provisions of a public water system’s 
CCC written program.  This is the “cream form.” 
 
3. Exceptions to High Health Hazard Premises Isolation Requirements   
 
Purveyors use this form to document and report exceptions to mandatory premises 
isolation requirements allowed under WAC 246-290-490(4)(b)(iii).  Only purveyors 
granting exceptions need to complete and submit this form.  This is the “green form.” 
 
The forms provided are those used for the reporting year indicated on the forms.  For copies of 
forms for later years, or for versions suitable for completion on screen using MS Word, contact 
the DOH Office of Drinking Water (see Appendix F)

The reasons for not requiring mandatory premises isolation shown in the table are typical examples.  purveyors 
are not required to follow or apply any of these reasons. 
• 
purveyors may provide other reasons consistent with WAC 246-290-490(4)(b)(ii), i.e., no hazard exists for this 
particular service. 
Reason that the Premises Do Not Pose a High Health Hazard to 
Check if Applicable
PWS 
Medical/Health Services Facility not having laboratory or similar  
facilities, e.g., Psychiatric or Counseling Office. 
 
Dental Office having independent water supplies for dental work (no  
interconnection with purveyor’s water system).
