Dear Mr, Blaylock: 
We recently 
completed 
a survey 
of the procurement 
of automobile 
and truck 
parts 
by Federal 
agenues. 
The purpose 
of this 
letter 
is 
to bring 
to your 
attention 
an apparent 
opportunity 
for 
the Federal 
Supply 
Service 
to help 
agencies 
achieve 
savings 
through 
the 
consolidation 
of prosurements. 
We found 
that 
Federal 
agencies 
were purchasmg 
repax 
parts 
from 
a multitude 
of suppliers 
under 
various 
methods of procurement, 
Thus resulted 
in substantially 
varying 
prices 
for 
the parts. 
Some 
procuring 
actxvxties 
were attemptmng 
to ccnsofidate 
their 
require- 
ments in order 
to achieve 
more favorable 
dzscounts, 
whzle 
others 
were purchasing 
8x1 an it=-by-item 
basis. 
In no cases, 
however, 
did we find 
that 
activities 
were sonsolldating 
thexr 
volumes 
wath 
other 
actlvlties 
to negotiate 
better 
prices. 
As a result 
of this 
fra,Pnaented procurement, 
local 
agencies 
were not taking 
advantage 
of 
the potential 
drscounts 
available 
through 
volume 
procurement. 
We examined 
the prxces 
paid 
for 
automotive 
parts 
by two Forest 
Servxe 
garages, 
the Atomic 
Energy 
Commission 
(AEC), Richland, 
Washington, 
and five 
agenczes in the Seattle/Tacoma 
area maintaining 
the largest 
vehxle 
repair 
faejellties. 
The actgvitles 
included 
Fort 
Lewxs9 General 
Services 
Admznistratxon 
(GSA) Hotor 
Pool, 
Seattle 
District 
Postal 
Service, 
NcChord Air 
Force Base (AFB), 
and Puget 
Sound Naval 
Shipyard 
(PSNS). 
At each location, 
we compared przces 
of replacement 
parts 
for 
general-purpose 
vehrcles 
manufactured 
by 
Ford, 
Chrysler, 
General 
Motors9 
American 
Motors, 
and International 
Harvester. 
, 
Automotive 
replacement 
parts 
can be classzfied 
rnto 
two 
categories--original 
eqaupment 
manufacturer's 
(OEM) parts 
and 
alternate 
parts. 
OHM parts 
are sold 
by the vehicle 
manufacturer 
and ats dealers. 
Alternate 
parts 
are sold 
under 
different 
brand 
names and przce 
lists 
than those Identified 
with 
the vehule 
manufacturer. 
Alternate 
parts 
are marketed 
przmarzly 
through 
auto 
parts 
stores 
rather 
than vehicle 
dealers. 
Examples of alternate 
parts 
brand 
names include 
Flagner, 
Monroe, 
Maremont, 
Echlin, 
Halley, 
Carter, 
and Borg Warner. 
We compared the prices 
paid 
for 
OEM parts 
with 
the pruzes 
that 
would 
have been pald 
had the part 
been purchased 
through 
nonmandatory 
Federal 
Supply 
Schedules. 
To provide 
a common basis 
for 
comparison, 
we related 
the prices 
paid 
for 
alternate 
parts 
to the przces 
available 
on the Federal 
Supply 
Schedule 
for 
an eqtivalent 
OEM part. 
An index 
system was developed 
whereby 
the Federal 
Supply 
Schedule 
price 
was set at a base of 180, 
The followmng 
table 
compares the average 
prrces 
paid 
by the 
actlvrties

Company (AEC cost-epe 
contractor). 
cj%zChord AFi3 used 
a contractor-operated 
parts 
store 
(COPARS) 
method of parts 
supply. 
Since 
the contractor 
bid 
relatively 
low on OHM parts 
and high 
on alternate 
parts, 
separate 
Indexes 
for 
OHM and alternate 
parts 
were not 
comparable. 
The combined 
Index 
was 95, 
-2- 
Thus table 
shows that 
AX 
and the Postal 
Service 
obtained 
the 
lowest 
prices 
for 
OEX parts 
and that 
the Postal 
Service 
was charged 
the lowest 
prices 
for 
alternate 
parts. 
We attribute 
these 
variances 
prLmarily 
to the agencies' 
selections 
of sources 
and methods of 
procurement. 
The followzng 
examples 
illustrate 
the wide variances 
in prices 
noted 
during 
our survey. 
PSNS generally 
purchased 
its 
alternate 
parts 
through 
blanket 
purchase 
agreements, 
PSNS would 
have saved 
45 percent 
If 
these parts 
could 
have been purchased 
under 
the Postal 
Sexplce's 
local 
term 
contract. 
As an example, 
PSNS purchased 
a Carter 
carburetor 
for 
a Dodge truck 
from 
an alternate 
parts 
supplier, 
who was not required 
to 
deliver, 
at a cost of 
$31.08. 
This 
same part 
was available 
through 
the Postal 
Service's 
local 
contract 
at a cost of 
$23.38 
dativered 
to the vehicle 
maintenance 
facility. 
A Forest 
Service 
garage 
normally 
purchased 
OEM part-s 
from 
a parts 
store 
under 
a blanket 
purchase 
agreement. 
The supplier 
generally 
purchased 
the parts 
from OEM dealers 
and frequently 
resold 
them to the Forest 
Service 
at list 
prices. 
For example, 
m November 
1973, 
the Forest 
Servace 
garage 
purchased 
for 
stock 
two Chevrolet 
wheels 
from the 
parts 
store 
at a total 
list 
price 
of $70.70. 
Had this 
purchase 
been made from the General 
Motors 
warehouse, 
the 
total 
price 
would 
have been $31.18, 
a difference 
of $39.52.

The lowest 
prices 
for 
General. hotors 
parts 
were obtamed 
by 
using 
the Federal 
Supply 
Schedule 
contractor 
as tie 
source 
of 
suPPlY* 
Also, 
most agencies 
were able 
to obtain 
Federal 
Supply 
Schedule 
przces 
for 
Amencan 
tifotors 
parts 
from either 
the contractor 
at Portland, 
Oregon, 
or American 
Motors 
dealers. 
The lowest 
prices 
for 
Ford, 
Chrysler, 
and International 
Harvester 
parts 
were attained 
by usmg 
term contracts 
as the pnnclpal 
method of purchase. 
Both 
the Postal 
Service 
and Federal 
Supply 
Sernce 
used this 
method of 
procurement. 
ABC used purchase 
orders 
while 
the other 
four 
agencies 
used blanket 
purchase 
agreements. 
Although 
substantial 
savings 
could 
be achieved 
by ordering 
General 
Motors 
parts 
from the Federal, 
Supply 
Schedule 
contractor, 
nest 
agencies 
were reluctant 
to use this 
source 
of supply 
because 
of the relatively 
longer 
delavery 
times 
evolved. 
The prlnclpal 
contractor 
supply 
point 
is located 
at Beaverton, 
Oregon. 
ALTEWATE PARTS 
As shown in the table 
at page 2, price 
mdexes 
for 
alternate 
parts 
ranged 
from a high 
of 128 for 
the Forest 
Servzce 
to a low of 
63 for 
the Postal 
Service. 
Average 
prices 
paid 
by flare 
agencies 
vzslted 
exceeded 
Postal 
Servlce 
prices 
by from 44 to 103 percent. 
While 
zhese fxve 
agencies 
use blanket 
purchase 
agreements 
or 
mtindual 
purchase 
orders 
(AX) 
as their 
predomnant 
method of 
procurement, 
the Postal 
Servzce 
uses term contracts. 
OPPOR~ITY 
FOR SAVINGS 
We believe 
the Government 
could 
achmve 
substantial 
savmgs 
through 
the use of competitively 
awarded 
term contracts 
to meet 
the combined 
auto parts 
needs of agencies 
at field 
locations. 
Whzle centralized 
purchases 
or procurements 
m large 
quantxties 
should 
result 
in the lowest 
possible 
prices, 
field 
ixastallatlons 
must consrder 
both 
price 
and dellveml 
time as maJor factors 
UI 
determning 
the best method of procureneut. 
Prompt 
delivery 
precludes 
the hxgh cost of muntainmg 
large 
inventories. 
Blanket 
purchase 
agreements 
Tath 
local 
concerns 
are an 
effective 
means of securmg 
parts 
promptly. 
However, 
as demonstrated 
previously, 
they are not an effective 
moans for 
attaming 
low prices. 
Regulations 
covering 
the use of blanket 
purchase 
agreements 
do 
not encourage 
eompetitlon, 
apparently 
in 
order 
to avoid 
the cost 
of securing 
quotations 
for 
small 
orders 
(under 
$250). 
For example, 
the Armed Senrices 
Procurement 
Regulations 
state: 
-4- 
-_II-I 
-_1*11_-- 
-------.-I-LII)~ 
--

Purchases 
Not in Excess of $250. 
Small purchases 
not exceeding 
$250 may be accomplrshed 
wrthout 
securrng 
competltrve 
quotations 
If 
the prices 
are consldered 
to be 
reasonable. 
Such purchases 
shall 
be dlstrlbuted 
equitably 
among quaIlfled 
suppllers. 
When practical, 
a quotation 
~111 
be sollcz&ed 
from 
other 
than 
the previous 
supplier 
prior 
to 
placing 
a repeat 
order. 
The admlnlstratlve 
cost 
of verlfylng 
the reasonableness 
of the price 
of purchases 
not m excess 
of $250 may more than offset 
potentaal 
savings 
m detecting 
Instances 
of overprlclng; 
therefore, 
action 
to verify 
the 
reasonableness 
of the price 
need be taken 
only when the 
buyer 
or contractmg 
officer 
suspects 
that, 
or has mforma- 
tlon 
to andlcate 
that, 
the price 
may not be reasonable, 
e g., 
comparison 
to previous 
price 
pazd, personal 
knowledge

involved 
H 
Thzs regulation 
seems to Ignore 
the fact 
that 
mdlvldual 
orders 
under 
$250, 
on a day-to-day 
basis, 
when considered 
over 
a period 
of time 
(a year) 
~~11 amount to several 
thousand 
dollars 
and that 
prices 
can be 
established 
m advance 
so that 
the cost of obtalnlng 
competltron 
and 
establlshlng 
prices 
need be incurred 
only 
once a year 
rather 
than every 
day or every 
week. 
Notwlthstandlng 
the apparent 
shortcomrngs 
UI the crted 
regulation, 
Federal 
Procurement 
Regulations 
provide 
a means of satlsfylng 
both 
price 
and prompt 
dellvery 
ObJectlves 
by encouraging 
cooperative 
use by one 
agency of the local 
term contracts 
of another 
agency. 
The regulations 
also 
state 
"In 
furtherance 
of the econormcal 
and other 
advantages 
to 
be galned 
from cross 
utlllzatlon 
of local 
term contracts, 
wherever 
possible 
the requirements 
of several 
offices 
UI 
the same community 
should 
be combined 
and Included 
In a 
szngle 
contract." 
The Report 
of The Commlsslon 
on Government 
Procurement 
endorses 
the 
use of lndeflnlte 
dellvery/quantlty 
type term contracts 
as an effective 
means of obtalnlng 
price 
advantages 
through 
consolidated 
purchasing 
without 
IncurrIng 
warehouslng 
costs 
and sxmpllfylng 
ordering 
by elz.mlnatlng 
lndlvldual 
purchases. 
Agencies 
we vlslted 
had not establlshed 
multiple-use 
local 
term 
contracts 
to meet their 
combined needs for 
commercial 
vehrcle 
parts. 
We belleve 
that 
neither 
the blanket 
purchase 
agreements 
nor 
the 
nonmandatory 
GSA Federal 
Supply 
Schedule 
1s the best method of procurement 
-5- 
for 
all 
purchases 
by field 
mstallatmns, 
because 
they do not provide 
optmum 
prices. 
Further, 
with 
respect 
to the Federal 
Supply 
Schedules, 
dellvery 
periods 
are frequently 
unacceptable 
to the agencies 
The table 
on page2 
shows that 
the Postal 
Service 
purchased 
alternate 
parts 
at slgnlflcantly 
lower 
prices 
than the other 
agencies 
vlslted, 
and 
the table 
on page 
3 shows that 
the Federal 
Supply 
Service 
purchased 
OEM 
parts 
(Ford, 
Chrysler, 
and InternatIonal 
Harvester) 
at substantially 
lower 
prrces. 
We belleve 
that 
local 
term contracts 
consolidating 
the 
needs for 
alternate 
parts 
at the local 
level 
would 
result 
In prices 
at 
least 
as low as those 
obtamed 
by the Seattle 
Dlstrlct 
Postal 
Servmze. 
While 
OEM price 
Indexes 
equivalent 
to those 
experienced 
by the Federal 
Supply 
Service 
most likely 
could 
not be achieved 
for 
multiple-use 
term 
contracts 
XL local 
areas 
(because 
the volume 
would 
be less 
than under 
the Federal 
Supply 
Servxce 
term contracts), 
we belleve 
there 
are opportunltles 
for 
lower 
prices. 
For example, 
the followrng 
price 
Indexes 
appear 
at talnable. 
General 
Motors--115, 
Ford--go, 
Chrysler--95, 
IHC--95. 
Smce General 
Motors 
parts 
can be purchased 
at substantially 
lower 
prices 
under 
the Federal 
Supply 
Schedule, 
we have encouraged 
agencies 
to 
use it whenever 
feasible. 
However, 
because 
of dellvery 
problems, 
It 
appears 
agencies 
~~11 continue 
to purchase 
a maJor share 
of General 
Motors 
parts 
needs locally. 
Accordingly, 
local 
term contracts 
should 
also 
result 
m savmgs 
for 
the purchase 
of General 
Motors 
parts. 
As a result 
of our survey, 
agencies 
are seeklng 
ways to obtain 
lower 
prrces 
for 
automotive 
parts, 
lncludlng 
the use of term contracts. 
Because Region
