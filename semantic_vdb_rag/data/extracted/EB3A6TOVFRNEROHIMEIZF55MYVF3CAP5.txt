Part III – New Construction 
The New Construction Regulations apply only to 
facilities submitted to the Construction Review Program 
after July 1st, 2009.  Facilities participating in the 
Medicare/Medicaid program prior to July 1st, 2009 must be 
able to show compliance with the federal requirements for 
existing facilities. Facilities participating in 
Medicare/Medicaid submitted after July 1st, 2009 must comply 
with the federal requirements for new facilities. 
 
 
WAC 246-320-500 Applicability of WAC 246-XXX-500 
through 246-XXX-XXX.  The purpose of the new construction 
regulations is to provide minimum standards for the 
construction, maintenance and operation of ambulatory 
surgical facilities and the establishment of a safe and 
adequate care and treatment environment. These rules are 
consistent with other accrediting organizations and federal 
agency rules and regulations without redundancy and 
contradictory requirements. Compliance with these new 
construction regulations does not relieve an ambulatory 
surgical facility of the need to comply with applicable 
state and local building and zoning codes. 
 
Page 30 
(1) These regulations apply to ambulatory surgical 
facilities as defined in RCW 70.230-010: 
(a) New buildings to be licensed as an ambulatory 
surgical facility; 
(b) Conversion of an existing building or portion 
thereof for use as an ambulatory surgical facility; 
(c) Additions to an existing ambulatory surgical 
facility; 
(d) Alterations to an existing ambulatory surgical 
facility. 
(2) The requirements of chapter 246-XXX WAC in effect 
at the time the application, fee, and construction 
documents are submitted to the department for review will 
apply for the duration of the construction project.  
 
 
WAC 246-XXX-505 Department Responsibilities – 
Construction Review, Approval of Plans.  This section 
identifies the actions and responsibilities of the 
department for reviewing and approving new construction of 
ambulatory surgical facilities. 
 
(1) Before issuing an approval, the department will 
verify compliance with chapter 70.230 RCW and this chapter

(b) Assure the issuance of a certificate of need, when 
needed, as provided in chapter 70.38 RCW; 
(c) Receipt of the application for construction review 
services and a full plan review fee based on Chapter 246-

must be prepared by, or under the direction of, an 
architect registered under chapter 18.08 RCW.  The services 
of a consulting engineer registered under chapter 18.43 RCW

appropriate.  The services of a registered professional 
engineer may be used in lieu of the services of an 
architect if work involves engineering only. 
(2) An ambulatory surgical facility must submit 
construction documents for proposed new construction to the 
department for review and approval prior to new 
construction as required in RCW 70.230.050(b).

all drawings to demonstrate that the required facilities 
for each function are provided. 
(c) Floor plan of the building showing the alterations 
and additions including location of any service or support 
areas. 
(d) For Additions and/or Alterations:  
(i) A plan to show how the ambulatory surgical 
facility will ensure the health and safety of occupants 
during construction and installation of finishes.  This 
includes taking appropriate infection control measures, 
keeping the surrounding area free of dust and fumes, and 
assuring rooms or areas are well-ventilated, unoccupied, 
and unavailable for use until free of volatile fumes and 
odors. 
(ii) A plan to show how the ambulatory surgical 
facility will provide safety during construction consistent 
with the fire code showing required paths of egress, exit
