SUMMARY   
H.Res. 759 resolves that Congress recognizes the 20th anniversary of the Freedom Sunday Rally 
for Soviet Jews in Washington, DC, which embodies the American principle of citizen activism 
for the greater good. 
 
BACKGROUND 
Beginning in 1967, many Jews applied to leave the Soviet Union to immigrate to other countries 
and were denied permission to emigrate by the Soviet government.  This group was commonly 
referred to as the refuseniks. 
 
The United States placed some sanctions on the Soviet Union.  In 1975, President Gerald Ford 
signed the Jackson-Vanik Amendment to the Trade Act of 1974 into law.  This Act prohibited 
the extension of trade benefits to countries that limit emigration.  In 1982, President Ronald 
Reagan enacted P.L. 97-157 which expressed the sense of Congress that the Soviet Union should 
cease its repressive actions against individuals who seek the freedom to emigrate or to practice 
their religious or cultural traditions. 
 
In 1984, the Congressional Coalition for Soviet Jews was formed to keep members and their 
staffs informed on developments in the Soviet Union. 
 
In 1987, more than 250,000 people participated in the Freedom Sunday Rally on the National 
Mall in support of the Soviet Jewry before the start of the Reagan-Gorbachev summit. 
 
In 1989, the Soviet Union relaxed their emigration policies and allowed the Soviet Jews to leave 
the country.  The Soviet Union codified the right of every Soviet citizen to emigrate in 1991.
