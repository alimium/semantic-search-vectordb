weight of the portion that is unloaded 
and (ii) the following statement: ‘‘Part- 
lot: The net weight stated herein re-
flects a partial unload.’’ 
(d) Certification of shiplot grain—(1) 
Basic requirement. The certificate shall 
show (i) if applicable, a statement that 
the grain has been loaded aboard with 
other grain, (ii) the official weight, (iii) 
the stowage or other identification of 
the grain, and (iv) other information 
required by the regulations and the in-
structions. 
(2) Common stowage. (i) Without sepa-
ration. If bulk grain is offered for 
weighing as it is being loaded aboard a 
ship and is loaded without separation 
in a stowage area with other grain or 
another commodity, the weight certifi-
cate for the grain in each lot shall 
show that the lot was loaded aboard 
with other grain or another commodity 
without separation and the relative lo-
cation of the grain. 
(ii) With separation. If separations are 
laid between adjacent lots, the weight 
certificates shall show the kind of ma-
terial used in the separations and the 
location of the separations in relation 
to each lot. 
(iii) Exception. The common stowage 
requirements of this paragraph shall 
not be applicable to the first lot in a 
stowage area unless a second lot has 
been loaded, in whole or in part, in the 
stowage area before issuing the official 
weight certificate for the first lot. 
(3) Official mark. If the grain is offi-
cially weighed in a reasonably contin-
uous operation, upon request by the ap-
plicant, the following statement may 
be shown on the weight certificate: 
‘‘Loaded 
under 
continuous 
official 
weighing.’’

§ 800.98
Weighing grain in combined 
lots. 
(a) General. The weighing of bulk or 
sacked grain loaded aboard, or being 
loaded aboard, or unloaded from two or 
more carriers as a combined lot shall 
be conducted according to this section 
and the instructions. 
(b) Weighing procedure. (1) Single lot 
weighing. Single lots of grain that are 
to be weighed as a combined lot shall 
be weighed in one location. The grain 
loaded into or unloaded from each car-
rier must be weighed in accordance 
with procedures prescribed in the in-
structions. In the case of sacked grain, 
a representative weight sample shall be 
obtained from the grain in each carrier 
unless otherwise specified in the in-
structions. 
(2) Recertification. Grain that has 
been weighed and certificated as two or 
more single lots may be recertificated 
as a combined lot provided that (i) the 
grain in each single lot has been 
weighed in one location, (ii) the origi-
nal weight certificates issued for the 
single lots have been or will be surren-
dered to the appropriate agency or field 
office, (iii) the official personnel who 
performed the weighing service for the 
single lots and the official personnel 
who are to recertificate the grain as a 
combined 
lot 
determine 
that 
the 
weight of the grain in the lots has not 
since changed and, in the case of 
sacked grain, that the weight samples 
used as a basis for weighing the single 
lots were representative at the time of 
the weighing. 
(3) Grain uniform in quality. An appli-
cant 
may 
request 
that 
grain 
be 
weighed and certificated as a combined 
lot whether or not the grain is uniform 
in quality for the purpose of inspection 
under the Act. 
(c) Certification procedures—(1) Gen-
eral. Each certificate for a combined- 
lot Class X or Class Y weighing service 
shall show the identification for the 
‘‘Combined lot’’ or, at the request of 
the applicant, the identification of 
each carrier in the combined lot. The 
identification and any seal information 
for the carriers may be shown on the 
reverse side of the weight certificate, 
provided the statement ‘‘See reverse 
side’’ is shown on the face of the cer-
tificate in the space provided for re-
marks. 
(2) Recertification. If a request for a 
combined-lot Class X or Class Y weigh-
ing service is filed after the grain in 
the single lots has been weighed and 
certificated, the combined-lot weighing 
certificate shall show (i) the date of 
weighing the grain in the combined lot 
(if the single lots were weighed on dif-
ferent dates, the latest of the dates 
shall be shown); (ii) a serial number, 
other than the serial numbers of the

weight certificates that are to be su-
perseded; (iii) the name of the elevator 
from which or into which the grain in 
the combined lot was loaded or un-
loaded; (iv) a statement showing the 
weight of the grain in the combined 
lot; (v) a completed statement showing 
the identification of any superseded 
certificate as follows: ‘‘This combined- 
lot certificate supersedes certificate 
Nos. ll, dated ll; and (vi) if at the 
time 
of 
issuing 
the 
combined-lot 
weight certificate the superseded cer-
tificates are not in the custody of the 
agency or field office, the statement 
‘‘The superseded certificates identified 
herein have not been surrendered’’ 
shall be clearly shown, in the space 
provided for remarks, beneath the 
statement identifying the superseded 
certificates. If the superseded certifi-
cates are in the custody of the agency 
or field office, the superseded certifi-
cates shall be clearly marked ‘‘Void.’’ 
(3) Part lot. If a part of a combined lot 
of grain in inbound carriers is unloaded 
and a part is left in the carriers, the 
grain that is unloaded shall be certifi-
cated in accordance with the provisions 
in § 800.97(c)(2). 
(4) Official mark. When grain is 
weighed as a combined lot in one con-
tinuous operation, upon request by the 
applicant, 
the 
following 
statement 
shall be shown on the weight certifi-
cate: ‘‘Loaded under continuous official 
weighing,’’ or ‘‘Loaded under contin-
uous official inspection and weighing.’’ 
(5) Further combining. After a com-
bined-lot weight certificate has been 
issued, there shall be no further com-
bining and no dividing of the certifi-
cate. 
(6) 
Limitations. 
No 
combined-lot 
weight certificate shall be issued (i) for 
any weighing service other than as de-
scribed in this section or (ii) which 
shows a weight of grain different from 
the total of the combined single lot.

§ 800.99
Checkweighing sacked grain. 
cording to this section and procedures 
prescribed in the instructions. 
(b) Representative sample. No official 
weight sample shall be considered to be 
representative of a lot of sacked grain 
unless the sample is of the size pre-
scribed in the instructions and has 
been obtained and weighed according 
to the procedures prescribed in the in-
structions. 
(c) Protecting samples and data. Offi-
cial personnel and other employees of 
an agency or the Service shall protect 
official weight samples and data from 
manipulation, substitution, and im-
proper and careless handling which 
might deprive the samples and sample 
data of their representativeness. 
(d) Restriction on weighing. No agency 
shall weigh any lot of sacked grain un-
less at the time of obtaining the offi-
cial weight sample the grain from 
which the sample was obtained was lo-
cated within the area of responsibility 
assigned to the agency, except as oth-
erwise provided for in § 800.117, or on a 
case-by-case basis as determined by the 
Administrator. 
(e) Equipment and labor. Each appli-
cant for weighing services shall provide 
necessary labor for obtaining official 
weight samples and place the samples 
in a position for weighing and shall 
supply suitable weighing equipment ap-
proved by the Service, pursuant to the 
regulations and the instructions. 
(f) Disposition of official weight sam-
ples. In weighing sacked grain in lots, 
the grain in the official weight samples 
shall be returned to the lots from 
which the samples were obtained. 
(g) Provisions by kinds of service—(1) 
‘‘IN’’ movements. Each checkweighing 
on an ‘‘IN’’ movement of sacked grain 
shall be based on an official weight 
sample obtained while the grain is at 
rest in the carrier or during unloading, 
in accordance with procedures pre-
scribed in the instructions. 
(2) ‘‘OUT’’ movements (export). Each 
checkweighing of sacked export grain 
shall be based on an official weight 
sample obtained as the grain is being 
loaded aboard the final carrier, as the 
grain is being sacked, or while the 
grain is at rest in a warehouse or hold-
ing facility, in accordance with proce-
dures prescribed in the instructions. 
(a) General. Each checkweighing serv-
ice performed on a lot of sacked grain 
to determine the weight of the grain 
shall be made on the basis of one or 
more official weight samples obtained 
from the grain by official personnel ac-
