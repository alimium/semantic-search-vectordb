Briefly explain the subject matter of the document(s):  Chapter 82.45 RCW imposes an excise
tax on real estate sales. This tax is imposed at the time of sale. WAC 458-61-090 explains
how to determine the date of sale. It also explains the application of interest and penalties
when the tax is not paid within thirty days of the date of sale.

Washington), or safety of Washington’s citizens?  (If the response is “no”, the
recommendation must be to repeal the document.)
Please explain.
3.  Related interpretive/policy statements, court decisions, BTA decisions, and WTDs:
Complete Subsection (a) only if reviewing a rule.  Subsection (b) should be completed only if the
subject of the review is an interpretive or policy statement. Excise Tax Advisories (ETAs),
Property Tax Advisories and Bulletins (PTAs/PTBs), and Interim Audit Guidelines (IAGs) are
considered interpretive and/or policy statements.
(a)
YES
NO
X
Are there any interpretive or policy statements that should be incorporated
into this rule? (An Ancillary Document Review Supplement should be
completed for each and submitted with this completed form.)
 X
Are there any interpretive or policy statements that should be cancelled
because the information is currently included in this or another rule, or the
information is incorrect or not needed? (An Ancillary Document Review
Supplement should be completed for each and submitted with this completed
form.)
X
Are there any Board of Tax Appeals (BTA) decisions, court decisions, or
Attorney General Opinions (AGOs) that provide information that should be
incorporated into this rule?
 X
Are there any administrative decisions (e.g., Appeals Division decisions
(WTDs)) that provide information that should be incorporated into the rule?
(b)
YES
NO
Should this interpretive or policy statement be incorporated into a rule?
Are there any Board of Tax Appeals (BTA) decisions, court decisions, or
Attorney General Opinions (AGOs) that affect the information now provided
in this document?
Are there any administrative decisions (e.g., Appeals Division decisions
(WTDs)) that provide information that should be incorporated into the
document?
If the answer is “yes” to any of the questions in (a) or (b) above, identify the pertinent
document(s) and provide a brief summary of the information that should be incorporated into the
document.
4.  Clarity and Effectiveness:
YES
NO
X
Is the document written and organized in a clear and concise manner?
X
Are citations to other rules, laws, or other authority accurate?  (If no, identify
the incorrect citation below and provide the correct citation.)
X
Is the document providing the result(s) that it was originally designed to
2
Rulervu.doc last revised 3/15/02
achieve? (E.g., does it reduce the need for taxpayers to search multiple rules
or statutes to determine their tax-reporting responsibilities or help ensure that
the tax law and/or exemptions are consistently applied?)
X
Do changes in industry practices warrant repealing or revising this document?
X
Do administrative changes within the Department warrant repealing or
revising this document?
Please explain.
5.  Intent and Statutory Authority:
YES
NO
X
Does the Department have sufficient authority to adopt this document?  (Cite
the statutory authority in the explanation below.)
X
Is the document consistent with the legislative intent of the statute(s) that
authorize it? (I.e., is the information provided in the document consistent with
the statute(s) that it was designed to implement?)  If “no,” identify the
specific statute and explain below.  List all statutes being implemented in
Section 9, below.)
X
Is there a need to recommend legislative changes to the statute(s) being
implemented by this document?
Please explain. RCW 82.45.150 provides the department rule-making authority for the
effective administration of this chapter.
6.  Coordination:  Agencies should consult with and coordinate with other governmental entities
that have similar regulatory requirements when it is likely that coordination can reduce
duplication and inconsistency.
YES
NO
X
Could consultation and coordination with other governmental entities and/or
state agencies eliminate or reduce duplication and inconsistency?
Please explain. The department has exclusive authority for making and administering excise
tax rules. The subject matter of WAC 458-61-090 (determining the date of sale for real
estate transactions and applying interest and penalty to delinquent real estate liabilities) is
applied by county officials and other professionals involved in the transfer of real estate
titles. The department continues to work closely with stakeholders, including the
Washington Association of County Officials, to eliminate or reduce inconsistency.
7.  Cost:  When responding, consider only the costs imposed by the document being reviewed
and not by the statute.
YES
NO
X
Have the qualitative and quantitative benefits of the document been
considered in relation to its costs? (Answer “yes” only if a Cost Benefit
Analysis was completed when the rule was last adopted or revised.)
3
Rulervu.doc last revised 3/15/02
Please explain. This is an interpretive rule that imposes no new or additional administrative
burdens on businesses that are not already imposed by the law.
8.  Fairness:  When responding, consider only the impacts imposed by the document being
reviewed and not by the statute.
YES
NO
X
Does the document result in equitable treatment of those required to comply
with it?
X
Should it be modified to eliminate or minimize any disproportionate impacts
on the regulated community?
X
Should the document be strengthened to provide additional protection to
correct any disproportionate impact on any particular segment of the regulated
community?
Please explain. This rule defines the date of sale, clarifies application of penalties and
interest, and describes when payment is due. The rule provides standards which promote
equitable treatment through consistent application of the underlying statutes.
The document nonetheless should cross-reference the date of sale information for sales of a
controlling interest of an entity owning Washington real property and provide direction for
determining the date of sale when water rights are transferred.
9.  LISTING OF DOCUMENTS REVIEWED:  Use “bullets” with any lists, and include
documents discussed above.  Citations to statutes, interpretive or policy statements, and similar
documents should include titles.  Citations to Attorney General Opinions (AGOs) and court,
Board of Tax Appeals (BTA), and Appeals Division (WTD) decisions should be followed by a
brief description (i.e., a phrase or sentence) of the pertinent issue(s).

Other Documents (e.g., special notices or Tax Topic articles, statutes or regulations administered
by other agencies or government entities, statutes, rules, or other documents that were reviewed
but were not specifically relevant to the subject matter of the document being reviewed):
10.  Review Recommendation:
      x    
Amend
          
Repeal/Cancel (Appropriate when action is not conditioned upon another rule-
 
making action or issuance of an interpretive or policy statement.)
          
Leave as is (Appropriate even if the recommendation is to incorporate the
current information into another rule.)
          
Begin the rule-making process for possible revision. (Applies only when the
             Department has received a petition to revise a rule.)
Explanation of recommendation:  Provide a brief summary of your recommendation.  If
recommending that the rule be amended, be sure to note whether the basis for the
recommendation is to:
• 
Correct inaccurate tax-reporting information now found in the current rule;
• 
Incorporate legislation;
• 
Consolidate information now available in other documents (e.g., ETAs, WTDs, and court
decisions); or
• 
Address issues not otherwise addressed in other documents (e.g., ETAs, WTDs, and court
decisions).
The rule should be revised to cross-reference the date of sale information for sales of a
controlling interest of an entity owning Washington real property.  It should also provide
direction for determining the date of sale when water rights are transferred.
