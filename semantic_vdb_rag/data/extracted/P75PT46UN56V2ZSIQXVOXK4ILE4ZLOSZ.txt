Abstract Thinning of Arctic sea ice gives rise to ice fracturing and leads (areas of open water surrounded
by sea ice) that are a potential source of sea salt aerosol. Atmospheric particle inorganic ion concentrations,
local sea ice conditions, and meteorology at Barrow, AK, from 2006 to 2009, were combined to investigate
the dependence of submicron (aerodynamic diameter < 1 μm) and supermicron (aerodynamic diameter
1–10 μm) sea saltmassconcentrationsonsea icecoverageandwind speed. Consistentwitha wind-dependent
source, supermicron sea salt mass concentrations increased in the presence of nearby leads and wind speeds
greater than 4 m s�1. Increased supermicron and submicron sea salt chloride depletion was observed for
periods of low winds or a lack of nearby open water, consistent with transported sea salt inﬂuence. Sea salt
aerosol produced from leads has the potential to alter cloud formation, as well as the chemical composition
of the Arctic atmosphere and snowpack.

Rapid sea ice loss is dramatically changing the Arctic surface [Serreze and Stroeve, 2015]. Mean
September coverage of Arctic sea ice decreased by �13.3% decade�1 for the period of 1979–2014
[Serreze and Stroeve, 2015], and complete summertime loss of sea ice is expected within 50 years
[Overland and Wang, 2013]. In the winter-spring, the Arctic is becoming increasingly dominated by
ﬁrst-year sea ice cover [Maslanik et al., 2011]. Thinner ﬁrst-year sea ice is less structurally stable and more
prone to fracturing, likely resulting in the formation of leads (transient areas of open water surrounded
by sea ice), as well as more pancake ice [Stroeve et al., 2012]. Increasing sea salt aerosol production is
expected from the newly exposed ocean surface [Browse et al., 2014; Struthers et al., 2011]. Sea ice loss
is also expected to increase the emissions of marine primary organic aerosol and dimethyl sulﬁde, as well as
lead to changes in aerosol processing and removal in the Arctic boundary layer through changing
meteorology [Browse et al., 2014].
Atmospheric aerosols represent the largest source of uncertainty in global radiative forcing predictions
[Boucher et al., 2013]. An increase in sea salt aerosol emissions will increase Arctic aerosol optical depth,
increasing the magnitude of aerosol direct radiative forcing (cooling) [Struthers et al., 2011]. Sea salt aerosols
can also indirectly alter radiative forcing by acting as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) [Wise et al., 2009].
Simulations by Browse et al. [2014] suggested that the CCN response to increased sea salt aerosol from the
Arctic Ocean is weak due to efﬁcient scavenging of particles and decreased new particle formation from a
greater condensation sink. However, the predicted CCN response was spatially nonuniform, with coastal
Arctic regions predicted to have a larger CCN response than the central Arctic Ocean [Browse et al., 2014].
Further, deposition of sea salt aerosol to the snow surface contributes to springtime atmospheric reactive
bromine chemistry and ozone depletion [Pratt et al., 2013; Simpson et al., 2005]. However, due to limited
Arctic aerosol measurements, the contributions and radiative impacts of sea salt aerosol under changing
sea ice conditions are uncertain.

Under open ocean conditions, sea salt aerosol mass concentrations typically increase with increasing wind
speed [Lewis and Schwartz, 2004] and decreasing water temperature [Salter et al., 2015]. Airborne sea salt
aerosol particles are formed by two distinct processes when bubbles on the seawater surface burst
[Blanchard and Woodcock, 1957]. The fragmentation of the top of the bubble membrane produces ﬁlm drops.
After the bubble membrane top bursts, droplets of water are ﬂung upward from the bubble bottom,

producing jet drops. Particles result from ﬁlm and jet drops after evaporation, with ﬁlm drops mainly resulting
in submicron particles and jet drops generally resulting in supermicron particles [O’Dowd et al., 1997]. Over
the open ocean, the bubble-bursting production of sea salt aerosol is driven by wind-induced wave breaking
that entrains air underneath the ocean surface. However, there is still uncertainty regarding the mechanism
of aerosol production from leads. Nilsson et al. [2001] and Leck et al. [2002] measured wind-dependent
number ﬂuxes of particles, likely produced through the bubble-bursting mechanism, from open leads at a
rate ~10 times less than the open ocean, which was attributed to the decreased fetch over the open leads.
However, Nilsson et al. [2001] found that an additional particle emission mechanism was needed to explain
the particle number ﬂuxes at low wind speeds. Studies conducted under lower wind speed conditions have
proposed emission mechanisms, including the transport of bubbles to the surface by increased turbulence
caused by supercooling conditions [Grammatika and Zimmerman, 2001], gas released from melting ice
[Leck and Bigg, 1999; Nilsson et al., 2001], phytoplankton respiration [Johnson and Wangersky, 1987], and a
surface heat ﬂux-driven mechanism [Norris et al., 2011].
Sea salt aerosol is a signiﬁcant contributor to Arctic particle mass [Quinn et al., 2002]. Given the impacts of sea
salt aerosol on climate and the changing sea ice surface, it is imperative to evaluate the contribution of sea
salt aerosol produced from leads. Previous Arctic spring [Radke et al., 1976; Scott and Levin, 1972] and summer
[Held et al., 2011a; Held et al., 2011b; Leck and Persson, 1996; Leck and Bigg, 1999; Leck and Svensson, 2015;
Leck et al., 2002; Nilsson et al., 2001] short-term intensive studies measured the direct ﬂux of particles from
leads over the pack ice. However, signiﬁcant uncertainty remains regarding the extent leads currently
inﬂuence Arctic particle mass concentrations over multiple seasons and at coastal locations. Therefore, to
build on previous work on the production of aerosols from leads and to probe the wind dependence of
sea salt aerosol production from Arctic leads across multiple seasons and years, we present an examination
of sea salt concentrations near Barrow, Alaska, under varying local sea ice and wind speed conditions from
April 2006 to December 2009.
2. Methods
2.1. Meteorology
Wind speed and wind direction data were available with 1 min resolution for the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Barrow Observatory (71°32′30″N, 156°61′14″W) at 10 m above ground.
Given that wind speeds ≥ 4 m s�1 over open ocean are typically associated with the formation of bubbles
responsible for sea salt aerosol production [Monahan and O’Muircheartaigh, 1986], wind speed data were
divided into three average wind speed categories: (1) “low” < 4 m s�1, (2) “moderate” 4–7 m s�1, and (3)
“high” >7 m s�1. As there are no direct measurements of wind speed over the adjacent Arctic Ocean avail-
able, it is assumed that local measured wind speed is representative of the wind speed over the nearby
sea ice and open water. The local wind speeds observed in this study are consistent with previous obser-
vations of Arctic wind speeds over sea ice [Tjernström et al., 2012], with low or moderate wind speeds pre-
sent for 22% and 62% of supermicron, respectively, and 29% and 48%, respectively, of submicron particle
sampling periods.
2.2. Sea Ice Radar
The coverage of local near-shore sea ice at Barrow, AK was determined by examination of radar backscatter
maps (http://seaice.alaska.edu/gi/data/barrow_radar) produced from a Furuno 10 kW, X-band marine radar,
which provides high spatial resolution sea ice imaging during both light and dark periods (Figure 1). The
radar operated atop a building in downtown Barrow (71°17′33″ N, 156°47′17″W) 22.5 m above sea level, with
a range of up to 11 km to the northwest [Druckenmiller et al., 2009; Eicken et al., 2011]. While the radar only
covered sea ice conditions to the northwest in this analysis, any lead activity observed within the 11 km range
analyzed in this study was assumed to reﬂect lead activity along the coast to the southwest and northeast, as
observed frequently by Mahoney et al. [2014]. Radar backscatter maps were manually analyzed to divide the
observed local sea surface into three categories: (1) full sea ice cover present, when local sea ice cover was
complete and no areas of exposed ocean surface were present; (2) leads present, when local sea ice cover
with areas of exposed ocean surface was present: and (3) open ocean, when no major local sea ice cover
was observed on the radar map (Figure 1).

2.3. Aerosol Chemical Composition
Atmospheric particles were sampled at
the NOAA Barrow Observatory 10 m
above the surface from April 2006 to
December 2009. Real-time wind direc-
tion was used to sample only from the
clean air sector (0°–129°) to avoid inﬂu-
ence from local pollution [Quinn et al.,
2002]. The Beaufort and Chukchi Seas
are 2–25 km upwind of the aerosol sam-
pling site in the clean air sector, so all air
sampled is assumed to be of direct mar-
ine origin. A Berner-type multijet cas-
cade impactor operating at a sample
ﬂow rate of 30 L min�1 with 50% cut
points at aerodynamic diameters (D50)
of 10 μm and 1 μm was used to collect
particles
with
aerodynamic
dia-
meters < 1 μm (referred to as submi-
cron particles) and 1–10 μm (referred
to as supermicron particles). Particles
with diameters < 1 μm passed through
an impactor to a rotating ﬁlter carousel
housing eight Millipore Fluoropore ﬁl-
ters (1.0 mm pore size). For every revolu-
tion of the rotating submicron ﬁlter
carousel, seven ﬁlters were sampled
individually, with sampling time varying
depending on season and particle load-
ings, and one ﬁlter, exposed to ambient
air for 10 s, served as a blank. Particles
with aerodynamic diameters between
1 and 10 μm were collected on Tedlar
ﬁlms over the course of one revolution
of the rotating submicron ﬁlter carousel,
with one additional ﬁlm collected as a
blank for every supermicron sample

collected. To minimize bounce of large particles onto downstream submicron ﬁlters, a 12 mm grease cup
coated with silicone grease and a ﬁlm coated with silicone spray were placed on the 10 μm jet [Quinn
et al., 2002]. Sample air was heated to maintain a stable reference relative humidity (RH) of 40% despite
changes in ambient RH. The stable sampling RH allows for a constant instrumental size segregation, and
all measurements are reported at the reference RH [Quinn et al., 2002]. Submicron and supermicron particle
sampling periods ranged from 1 to 11 days and 5 to 35 days, respectively. After collection, sealed ﬁlters and
ﬁlms were shipped to the NOAA Paciﬁc Marine Environmental Laboratory for analysis.
For inorganic ion analysis, ﬁlters and ﬁlms were ﬁrst wetted with 1 mL of spectral grade methanol. Five milli-
liters of distilled deionized water was then added to the solution, and the samples were extracted by sonicat-
ing for 30 min. Concentrations of major cations (Na+, NH4
+, K+, Mg2+, and Ca2+) and anions (CH3SO3
�, Cl�,
Br�, NO3
�, SO4
2�, and C2O₄2�) extracted from each submicron and supermicron particle sample were mea-
sured by ion chromatography [Quinn et al., 1998]. Details of the inlet, sampling procedures, and chemical ana-
lyses can be found in Delene and Ogren [2002] and Quinn et al. [2002]. Based on the aerosol sampling ﬂow rate
(30 L min�1) and typical sampling time, the detection limits calculated as 2 times the standard deviation of
the blank for the major sea salt ions of interest, Na+ and Cl�, were both 0.0002 μg m�3. For periods that were
below the detection limit, a value of half the detection limit (0.0001 μg m�3) was substituted for calculations.
Periods below the detection limit constituted 0% of supermicron and 12% submicron sampling periods for
Na+ and 3% of supermicron and 20% submicron sampling periods for Cl�. Na+ mass concentration is a con-
servative tracer for sea salt mass [Legrand et al., 2016] and will be discussed henceforth in the place of sea salt
mass to avoid biases from varying chloride depletion. While sea spray aerosol is a complex mixture of inor-
ganic salts and organic compounds, the distribution of which alters the chemical and physical properties
of the particle, sea spray aerosol is primarily (>60%) composed of inorganic salt [Quinn et al., 2015]. All Na+
is assumed to be derived from seawater [Quinn et al., 2002], as Sirois and Barrie [1999] showed that the major-
ity of Na+ in the Arctic is associated with sea salt aerosol. Error was calculated as the standard error of the
mean and is not shown for periods when only one sampling period fell into the given sea surface and wind
speed category.
3. Results and Discussion
3.1. Sea Salt Mass Concentrations
A clear dependence of supermicron (1–10 μm) Na+ (sea salt) mass concentrations on the combination of local
sea ice coverage and wind speed was observed (Figure 2a). There was little difference in the supermicron Na+
mass concentrations observed for periods with no leads present and low (<4 m s�1) (0.04 ± 0.01 μg m�3) or
moderate (4–7 m s�1) (0.03 μg m�3) wind speeds compared to periods with leads and low wind speeds
(0.026 ± 0.009 μg m�3). However, for periods characterized by moderate wind speeds, supermicron Na+ mass
concentrations were higher when leads were present (0.11 ± 0.03 μg m�3) compared to when full sea ice
cover was present (0.03 μg m�3). Unfortunately, no supermicron sampling periods of full sea ice coverage
with high wind speeds (>7 m s�1) were present for comparison to periods of leads present with high
wind speeds.
When leads were present, supermicron Na+ mass concentrations were 4 and 10 times greater for periods with
moderate (0.11 ± 0.03 μg m�3) and high (0.3 ± 0.1 μg m�3) wind speeds, respectively, in comparison to low
wind speeds (0.03 ± 0.01 μg m�3) (Figure 2a). This is consistent with wind-driven sea salt aerosol number
ﬂuxes from leads observed directly by Nilsson et al. [2001] and Leck et al. [2002]. Local leads, when observed
by the sea ice radar, are the most likely source for the wind-dependent supermicron Na+ mass observed in
this study, as the lifetime of supermicron aerosols in the boundary layer is typically < 12 h [Williams et al.,
2002]. The short lifetime of these supermicron particles limits the distance from which the majority of these
particles could have originated, for the wind speeds observed, to a scale of a few hundred kilometers, which
would fall within the area of Arctic sea ice coverage in the winter-spring and for which the sea ice radar is
representative of ice fracturing conditions [Mahoney et al., 2014].
The highest supermicron Na+ mass concentrations are expected for open ocean and high wind speeds, as sea
salt aerosol production generally increases with increasing wind speed and fetch [Lewis and Schwartz, 2004].
While no supermicron particle sampling periods occurred for open ocean and low wind speeds, periods of

(c) total size ranges, and (d) the fraction of the total Na+ mass that was observed in the supermicron size range, separated
into nine bins based on local sea ice extent and wind speed. Sea ice extent categories include full ice, leads present, and open
water. Wind speed categoriesinclude low (<4 m s�1), mid (4–7 m s�1), and high (>7 m s�1). All error bars were calculated as
the standard error of the mean, and the numbers above each category indicate the number of samples in that category.
open ocean with moderate wind speeds showed supermicron Na+ mass concentrations (0.5 ± 0.1 μg m�3)
5 times greater than for periods when leads were present with moderate winds. Previously, sea salt
aerosol number ﬂuxes over leads were measured to be 10 times smaller than those over the open ocean
at similar wind speeds, an observation which was attributed to the smaller fetch and area of exposed
water [Leck et al., 2002; Nilsson et al., 2001]. Therefore, these long-term measurements show that while
a smaller source than open water, leads are a signiﬁcant wind-dependent source of supermicron sea salt
particle mass in the Arctic. The supermicron Na+ mass concentration for high wind speeds (0.3 μg m�3)
was slightly lower than for periods of open ocean with moderate winds (0.5 ± 0.1 μg m�3), contrary to
that expected based on the dependence of sea salt aerosol mass over open ocean on wind speed
[Lewis and Schwartz, 2004]. However, only one open ocean aerosol sampling period was characterized
by sustained high winds, imparting uncertainty in the trend that can be attributed to the small sample
size and natural variability in meteorological conditions that would impact sea salt aerosol concentra-
tions through deposition and marine boundary layer mixing [Lewis and Schwartz, 2004]. However, it is
important to note that despite these confounding factors there are statistically signiﬁcant trends
overall in the dependence of supermicron sea salt concentrations on local sea ice extent and local
wind speed.

There was no overall dependence of submicron (<1 μm) Na+ mass concentrations on local sea ice coverage
and wind speed (Figure 2b). Unlike supermicron Na+ mass concentrations, submicron Na+ mass concentra-
tions did not increase substantially when leads were present. The average submicron Na+ mass concentration
when leads were present was 0.25 ± 0.03 μg m�3, compared to 0.21 ± 0.06 μg m�3 when leads were not pre-
sent. In further contrast to supermicron Na+ mass concentrations, a wind speed dependence in submicron
Na+ mass concentration was not observed when leads were present (Figure 2b). In fact, open ocean periods
with low or moderate wind speeds resulted in the lowest observed submicron Na+ mass concentrations
(0.03 ± 0.02 μg m�3 and 0.11 ± 0.03 μg m�3, respectively). The lack of correlation of submicron Na+ mass
concentrations with local sea ice coverage and wind speed is most likely due to the longer atmospheric
residence time of submicron sea salt particles, compared to supermicron sea salt particles [Gong et al.,
2002; Williams et al., 2002]. The shorter residence time of supermicron sea salt aerosol decreases the inﬂuence
of long-range transport, which signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced the observed submicron sea salt aerosol, as discussed
in section 3.2. The long-range transport of submicron sea salt aerosol produced from high-latitude open
ocean sources to the Arctic could therefore have a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on submicron Na+ mass concentra-
tions, as previously concluded [Barrie and Barrie, 1990; Barrie et al., 1994; Quinn et al., 2002; Sirois and Barrie,
1999; Sturges and Barrie, 1988].
During periods of full sea ice cover and open ocean, submicron Na+ mass concentrations exhibited a
correlation with wind speed. For full sea ice periods, submicron Na+ mass concentrations increased from
low (0.19 ± 0.05 μg m�3) and moderate (0.2 ± 0.1 μg m�3) to high wind speed (0.3 μg m�3), although the
increase from moderate to high wind speed was not statistically signiﬁcant, in part due to the availability of
only one sampling period at high wind speed for comparison (Figure 2b). Under full ice conditions, a non–wave
breaking source of Na+, as discussed in section 3.4, could potentially contribute, in addition to long-range
transport, as discussed in section 3.2. For open ocean periods, submicron Na+ showed a greater dependence
on local meteorology. Submicron Na+ mass concentrations increased from low (0.03 ± 0.01 μg m�3) to moder-
ate (0.11 ± 0.03 μg m�3) and high (0.2 ± 0.1 μg m�3) wind speeds. However, the increase from moderate to
high wind speeds was not statistically signiﬁcant. The higher sea salt concentrations under these open ocean
conditions, along with the decrease in the fraction of aged submicron sea salt periods discussed in section 3.2,
suggests the inﬂuence of submicron sea salt production from local wind-driven wave breaking processes.
Overall, the supermicron fraction of the total Na+ mass concentration increased with decreasing sea ice cov-
erage and, in the presence of leads, increasing wind speed (Figures 2c and 2d). Supermicron Na+ mass con-
centrations comprised less than 20% of the total Na+ mass concentrations for periods with full sea ice cover
and with leads and low winds. In the presence of leads, the supermicron Na+ mass fraction increased with
increasing wind speed. At moderate wind speeds the supermicron Na+ mass concentration comprised
40% of the total Na+ mass concentration for periods with leads, ~4 times greater than periods with leads
and low wind speeds. Then, for periods with leads and high wind speeds, the supermicron Na+ mass fraction
increased to 50% of the total Na+ mass concentration. Finally, the supermicron Na+ mass fraction was the
most dominant for periods with open ocean, comprising 60–80% of the total Na+ mass concentration. The
dependence of supermicron Na+ mass fraction on local sea ice coverage and wind speed highlights that
the supermicron sea salt aerosol population is more directly inﬂuenced by local sea ice coverage and wind
speed than the submicron sea salt aerosol population, as expected due to the longer atmospheric residence
time of submicron sea salt particles [Gong et al., 2002; Williams et al., 2002].
3.2. Contributions of Aged Sea Salt Aerosol
Cl�/Na+ molar ratios were calculated to investigate sea salt aerosol lifetime and chemical processing, a mea-
sure of the inﬂuence of long-range transport. Sea salt aerosol retains the Cl�/Na+ molar ratio of seawater
(1.16) when introduced into the atmosphere [Keene et al., 1986]. This ratio is altered in the atmosphere
through the displacement of chlorine through reaction with acidic gases, such as H2SO4, or aqueous oxida-
tion of SO2(g) [Keene et al., 1998]. The extent of aging is thus dependent on atmospheric residence time, as
well as the original particle mass and acidic precursor concentrations in the atmosphere [Leck et al., 2002].
Previous work has shown that ﬁne sea salt aerosol (aerodynamic diameter < 2.5 μm) are more likely to have
greater chloride depletion than those of larger diameter coarse (aerodynamic diameter > 2.5 μm) sea salt
aerosol [Barrie et al., 1994; Hara et al., 2002; Leck et al., 2002]. In addition, previous work has shown that sea

Figure 3. The fraction of sampling periods with a Cl� enrichment factor < 0.75, corresponding to aged sea salt for

similar to Figure 2.
salt aerosols exhibit greater depletion following polar sunrise when production of sulfuric acid from the
oxidation of SO2(g) occurs in the Arctic troposphere [Sirois and Barrie, 1999]. Using Cl�/Na+ molar ratios
(Figure S1 in the supporting information), fractions of sampling periods dominated by “aged” sea salt were
calculated for each sea ice and wind speed category (Figure 3). Aged sea salt was deﬁned as having a Cl�
enrichment factor < 0.75. Cl� enrichment factor is determined by dividing the Cl�/Na+ ratio of the aerosol
sample by the Cl�/Na+ ratio of bulk seawater [Newberg et al., 2005]. Therefore, an enrichment factor < 0.75
corresponds to the depletion of 25% or more of Cl� from sea salt aerosol and represents particles that have
undergone signiﬁcant atmospheric processing. Sampling periods with a Cl�/Na+ enrichment factor > 0.75
were considered to consist primarily of “fresh” sea salt produced from local sources.
The average fraction of aged submicron sea salt periods (0.74 ± 0.07) across all local sea ice coverage and wind
speed categories was higher than the fraction of aged supermicron sea salt periods (0.39 ± 0.06) (Figure 3). The
median Cl�/Na+ molar ratios for submicron and supermicron sea salt aerosol sampling periods also exhibited a
dependence on local sea ice coverage and wind speed (Figure S2). Overall, the median Cl�/Na+ molar ratio of
submicron sea salt periods (0.62) was lower than the median Cl�/Na+ molar ratio for supermicron sampling
periods (0.86) (Figure S2). This indicates that the atmospheric processing undergone by the submicron sea salt
resulted in a greater Cl� depletion than the supermicron sea salt, as expected since smaller particles have a
longer residence time [Williams et al., 2002] and a higher surface area to volume ratio [McInnes et al., 1994].

The highest fractions (0.7–0.8) of aged sea salt sampling periods were observed when full sea ice cover with
low and moderate wind speeds were present, consistent with the lack of a local sea salt source (Figure 3). The
fractions of aged submicron and supermicron sea salt periods when leads or open ocean were present with
low wind speed were similarly high (0.6–0.8). That some of the highest fractions of aged sea salt were
observed under low wind conditions across all sea ice coverage categories indicates that the sea salt
observed during low wind periods, regardless of sea ice coverage, experienced increased atmospheric
processing, likely due to long-range transport.
For periods with leads present, the fraction of aged submicron and supermicron sea salt periods, respectively,
decreased from low (0.77 ± 0.06; 0.7 ± 0.2) to moderate (0.74 ± 0.05; 0.39 ± 0.09) to high wind speeds (0.64
± 0.06; 0.1 ± 0.1), consistent with greater contributions from a wind-dependent local sea salt aerosol source
(Figure 3). However, this potential decrease in the fraction of aged submicron sea salt periods with increased
wind speed, when leads were present, was partly within error. When open ocean was present, the fraction of
aged submicron sea salt periods decreased, partly within error, with increasing wind speed (low wind
speed = 0.8 ± 0.2; moderate wind speed = 0.75 ± 0.07; high wind speed = 0.3 ± 0.1), again consistent with a
wind-dependent local sea salt aerosol source. These trends in sea salt aging are consistent with local sea salt
aerosol production increasing with decreasing local sea ice coverage and increasing wind speed. This further
supports wind-driven sea salt aerosol production, dominated by supermicron particles, from leads.
3.3. Difference in Particle Production From Leads Versus Open Ocean
In addition to differences in particle lifetime between submicron and supermicron sea salt aerosol [Williams
et al., 2002], differences in the production mechanisms of submicron and supermicron sea salt aerosol from
leads likely also contributed to the observed trends in aged fractions and sea salt mass fractions. Leck et al.
[2002] and Nilsson et al. [2001] hypothesized that compared to open ocean production, ﬁlm drop particle pro-
duction from leads depends less on wind speed than jet drop particle production. As a result, the sea salt
aerosol size distribution over pack ice is dominated by a larger particle diameter lognormal mode at
~2 μm, while over open ocean, a smaller particle diameter lognormal mode centered at 100 nm dominates
[Nilsson et al., 2001]. This is consistent with the lognormal size distribution of sea salt aerosol resulting from
ﬁlm and jet drops centered at ~100–200 nm and ~1–2 μm dry diameters, respectively, measured by O’Dowd
et al. [1997]. Thus, the larger contribution of fresh supermicron sea salt, compared to submicron sea salt,
observed during periods with leads and moderate to high winds (Figure 3) is consistent with the hypothesis
that jet drops are the dominant production mechanism of sea salt aerosol from leads. Additionally, the
increased presence of smaller particles over open ocean observed by Nilsson et al. [2001] is evident in this
study by the increased presence of fresh submicron sea salt during periods of open ocean and high wind
speeds (Figure 3). These results therefore suggest that the differences in wind-driven production of sea salt
aerosol from leads, compared to open ocean, shift the mass distribution of sea salt aerosol in the Arctic
toward larger sizes when leads are present. This could impact radiative forcing and cloud processes in the
Arctic as CCN efﬁciency is size dependent [Dusek et al., 2006].
3.4. Non–Wave Breaking Particle Sources
Sea salt aerosol production from local leads and open ocean appears to be the dominant contributor to sea
salt mass concentrations in this study. However, submicron sea salt mass concentrations, sampled under con-
ditions where local sea salt aerosol production are not expected (e.g., 0.21 ± 0.06 μg m�3 when full sea ice
cover was present), were equal to or greater than those from other categories where local sea salt production
are expected (e.g., 0.12 ± 0.03 μg m�3 when open ocean was present). This suggests that there were sea salt
aerosol sources even when no exposed ocean surface was present (Figure 2b). Frost ﬂowers, highly saline ice
crystals grown on rapidly freezing open leads, are a potential source for wind-driven sea salt aerosol
production when no open ocean is present [Rankin et al., 2000]. However, as discussed in the supporting
information, the contribution from wind-blown frost ﬂowers to the measured sea salt aerosol concentrations
was likely minor as there were no full sea ice cover sampling periods with SO4
2�/Na+ molar ratios indicative
of frost ﬂowers (<0.02) (Figure S3) [Douglas et al., 2012]. In comparison, SO4
2�/Na+ molar ratios for fresh
seawater and fresh sea salt aerosol are ~0.06 [Keene et al., 2007]. However, sulfate isotope analysis would
be necessary to fully determine the inﬂuence of frost ﬂowers, as anthropogenic sulfates can mask the
sulfate depleted frost ﬂower sea salt [Norman et al., 1999; Seguin et al., 2014]. High winds can also loft
saline snow particles, which are suggested to form aerosols by sublimation [Lieb-Lappen and Obbard, 2015;

Yang et al., 2008]. The increase in submicron Na+ mass concentrations from low wind speed (0.19± 0.05μg m�3),
to moderate wind speed (0.2 ± 0.1μg m�3), to high wind speed (0.3 μg m�3) for periods with full sea ice cover
was not also observed in the supermicron Na+ mass concentrations. Therefore, additional detailed ﬁeld
measurements of aerosol size and chemical composition are required to examine the potential size-dependent
production of aerosols from blowing snow. However, this increase in submicron Na+ mass concentration was
within error. In addition, the Cl�/Na+ ratio of blowing snow in Barrow, AK, is expected to be similar to the ocean
water ratio [Jacobi et al., 2012], such that any fresh sea salt observed during full ice periods can potentially be
attributed to this source. Therefore, with less than 30% of the full sea ice cover submicron and supermicron
sampling periods characterized by fresh sea salt, the contribution from blowing snow production to the observed
Na+ mass concentrations is likely minor with transported sea salt aerosol representing a greater contribution.
3.5. Seasonality of Sea Salt Aerosol Production
The Arctic sea ice coverage undergoes seasonal changes, with growth during winter, loss during summer,
and pack ice movement due to winds and currents [Mahoney et al., 2014]. In this study, particle sampling
periods with local full sea ice cover occurred during the months of November through June (Figure S4).
For these months, 11–36% and 0–25% of all submicron and supermicron particle sampling periods, respec-
tively, corresponded to local full sea ice coverage. For Barrow, AK, Quinn et al. [2002] previously observed a
winter maximum in submicron sea salt aerosol, attributed to long-range transport from high-latitude regions
of the Paciﬁc and Atlantic Oceans with seasonally high winds. This is consistent with the observations of the
highest fractions of aged sea salt and submicron Na+ mass concentrations during sampling periods with full
sea ice cover, suggesting that the winter sea salt aerosol population had the longest transport time from its
source. As expected, open ocean near Barrow was observed between July and November (Figure S4). The
minimum fractions of aged sea salt and maximum supermicron Na+ mass concentrations were observed
during these periods of local open ocean, suggesting the sea salt aerosol population during summer had
the shortest transport time from its source. The lower particle dry deposition velocity, and resulting longer
particle lifetime, over sea ice compared to over open ocean in the Arctic [Nilsson and Rannik, 2001] likely also
contributed to the higher fraction of aged sea salt and higher submicron Na+ mass concentrations during
sampling periods with full sea ice cover compared to periods of local open ocean. Nearby leads were
observed to be present between October and July and were the dominant sea ice category over the entire
study (Figure S3). Supermicron particle sampling periods with leads present comprised 50–91% of the
supermicron particle sampling periods months of October to July. Submicron particle sampling periods with
leads present comprised 64–91%, and 5%, of submicron particle sampling periods November to July, and
October, respectively. This suggests that sea salt aerosol production from leads currently impacts sea salt
aerosol mass concentrations, especially in the supermicron particle size range, in the Arctic atmosphere
throughout the majority of the year.
4. Conclusions
This three-year study at Barrow, AK allowed a comprehensive investigation into the inﬂuences of sea ice cov-
erage and wind speed on sea salt mass concentrations in the coastal Arctic. Wind-driven production of sea
salt aerosol from leads contributes signiﬁcantly to sea salt aerosol mass concentrations in the Arctic, but to
a lesser extent than wind-driven production of sea salt aerosol from open ocean. This is consistent with pre-
vious short-term summertime number ﬂux measurements of sea salt aerosol over open leads, where sea salt
aerosol emissions were ~10 times smaller than the open ocean [Leck et al., 2002; Nilsson et al., 2001]. The inﬂu-
ence of sea salt aerosol production from open leads was most apparent in the supermicron size range, as evi-
denced by the strong dependence on wind speed of supermicron sea salt mass concentrations, which
increased by a factor of 10 from periods with low wind speed to periods with high wind speeds, when leads
were present. The increase in supermicron Na+ mass concentration from 0.035 ± 0.007 μg m�3, when leads
were not present, to 0.12 ± 0.02 μg m�3 when leads were present, provides further evidence of the inﬂuence
of sea salt aerosol production from leads. There was evidence of wind-driven submicron sea salt production
from local leads, but submicron sea salt, depleted in chloride, from long-range transport comprised the
majority (~70%) of the submicron sea salt mass. The inﬂuence of long-range transport was greatest when
local sea salt aerosol production would not be expected, including periods of low winds and full sea ice cover.

This improves our knowledge of complex atmosphere-sea ice feedbacks [Shepson et al., 2012]. Supermicron
sea salt aerosol production from leads could increase direct radiative forcing, as supermicron sea salt can con-
tribute signiﬁcantly to scattering in the remote marine boundary layer [Quinn et al., 1998]. This supermicron
sea salt aerosol could also impact indirect radiative forcing and cloud properties as giant CCN (2–10 μm),
which can induce the formation of larger cloud droplets and accelerate precipitation in the presence of smal-
ler particles [Yin et al., 2000]. The CCN response to supermicron sea salt aerosol produced from leads may be
reduced by the efﬁcient removal of large particles in the highly scavenging nature of the Arctic atmosphere,
particularly in summer [Browse et al., 2012]. Supermicron sea salt aerosol emissions from leads would also
increase the atmospheric condensation sink, which is predicted to suppress particle nucleation from
dimethyl sulﬁde and reduce total CCN concentrations [Browse et al., 2014]. Increased emissions of supermi-
cron sea salt aerosol from leads thus could play an important role in controlling the CCN response to changes
in sea ice [Browse et al., 2014]. Supermicron sea salt aerosol could also alter snowpack and atmospheric
halogen photochemistry, and therefore atmospheric oxidation [Simpson et al., 2005]. The impacts of wind-
driven production of sea salt aerosol from leads could be particularly evident in winter and early spring when
sea ice coverage is at its maximum and submicron sea salt mass concentrations are typically higher than
supermicron sea salt mass concentrations due to a lack of local open ocean source [Quinn et al., 2002].
Given decreasing multiyear sea ice extent and increasing ice fracturing [Stroeve et al., 2012], wind-driven
production of supermicron sea salt aerosol from leads could therefore increase the supermicron sea salt
aerosol mass fraction in the Arctic in the winter-spring, changing the annual contributions of sea salt aerosol
to the Arctic winter and early spring [Sirois and Barrie, 1999] may further increase the atmospheric sea salt
mass burden [Browse et al., 2012]. To fully understand the inﬂuence of sea salt aerosol produced from leads,
measurements of sea salt aerosol concentrations with higher time resolution must be combined with sea ice
coverage measurements that take into account a larger area. Furthermore, to understand the long-term
impacts of changing sea ice on the Arctic, decadal comparisons between sea ice conditions and sea salt
aerosol are necessary.
