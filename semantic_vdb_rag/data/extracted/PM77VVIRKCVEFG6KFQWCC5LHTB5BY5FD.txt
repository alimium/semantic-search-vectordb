School Accountability Status Categories 
School in Good Standing: A school is considered to be in 
good standing if it has not been identified as a School in Need 
of Improvement, Requiring Corrective Action, Planning for 
Restructuring, or Requiring Academic Progress, or as a 
School Under Registration Review. 
School Requiring Academic Progress: Under the State 
component of New York’s accountability system, a school that 
does not make AYP in the same grade and subject for two 
consecutive years is considered a School Requiring Academic 
Progress (Year 1) for the following year. In each succeeding 
year that the school fails to make AYP, the year designation is 
incremented by one. 
School in Need of Improvement (Year 1):  A school that has 
not made AYP for two consecutive years in the same grade 
and subject while receiving Title I funds is considered a School 
in Need of Improvement (Year 1) for the following year. 
School in Need of Improvement (Year 2):  A School in Need 
of Improvement (Year 1) that does not make AYP in the grade 
and subject for which it was identified while receiving Title I 
funds is considered a School in Need of Improvement (Year 2) 
for the following year.

The list below defines the school status categories under New York State’s school accountability system, which is divided into 
a Federal Title I component and a State component. A school that does not receive Title I funding in a school year does not have a 
federal status in that year. Schools receiving Title I funds that are not in good standing must provide school choice for their students; 
those in need of improvement year 2 and beyond must also provide Supplemental Education Services to eligible students. Other 
consequences for schools not in good standing can be found at: www.emsc.nysed.gov/deputy/nclb/accountability/siinfo.htm. To 
be removed from any improvement status, a school must make Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) in the grade and subject for which it 
was identified for two consecutive years, or in the case of a School Under Registration Review, achieve the performance targets 
established for the school by the Commissioner.

group with 30 or more continuously enrolled students must equal or 
exceed the Effective AMO. To make safe harbor, the Performance Index 
of each of these groups must equal or exceed its ELA safe harbor target 
and the group must meet the elementary-level science qualification for 
safe harbor. (See the elementary-level science page of this report for

Qualification for Safe Harbor in Elementary-Level ELA and Math: 
For an accountability group to be considered Qualified for Safe Harbor 
in Elementary-Level ELA and Math, the PI must equal or exceed the 
State Science Standard or the Science Progress Target in elementary-
level science for that group. Groups with fewer than 30 students tested 
in elementary-level science are not subject to this qualification criterion. 
Science Progress Targets: The elementary-level 2003–04 Science 
Progress Target is calculated by multiplying the 2002–03 Percent At or 
Above SDL by two and then adding one point. The 2004–05 Science 
Progress Target is calculated by adding one point to the 2003–04 PI. 
The 2004–05 target is provided for groups whose PI was below the 
State Science Standard in 2003–04.

Made AYP in Science in 2003–04: For a school or a district to make AYP 
in science, the Performance Index (PI) for the “All Students” group must 
equal or exceed the State Science Standard or the Science Progress 
Target. 
State Designated Level (SDL):  The score that students taking the 
elementary-level science test in 2002–03 must have equaled or exceeded 
on the written portion of the test to have met the State Science Standard.

Glossary 
Graduation-Rate Cohort: Graduation-rate cohort for each year includes all 
students in the accountability cohort in the previous year plus all students 
excluded from that accountability cohort solely because they transferred to a 
general education development (GED) program. Certain students with 
severe disabilities and new immigrants were excluded from the 1999 
graduation-rate cohort. 
Graduation-Rate Standard: The criterion value that represents a minimally 
satisfactory percentage of cohort members earning a local diploma. The 
State Graduation-Rate Standard is 55 percent. The Commissioner may raise 
the Graduation-Rate Standard at his discretion in future years. 
Performance Index (PI):  A Performance Index is a value from 0 to 200 that 
is assigned to an accountability group, indicating how that group performed 
on a required State test (or approved alternative) in English language arts, 
mathematics, or science. Student scores on the tests are converted to four 
achievement levels, from Level 1 (indicating no proficiency) to Level 4 
(indicating advanced proficiency). At the elementary and middle levels, the 
PI is calculated using the following equation: 100 × [(Count of 
Continuously Enrolled Tested Students Performing at Levels 2, 3, and 4 
+ the Count at Levels 3 and 4) ÷ Count of All Continuously Enrolled 
Tested Students]. At the secondary level, the PI is calculated using the 
following equation: 100 × [(Count of Cohort Members Performing at 
Levels 2, 3, and 4 + the Count at Levels 3 and 4) ÷ Count of All Cohort 
Members].  A list of tests used to measure student performance for 
accountability is available at www.emsc.nysed.gov/irts. 
Progress Target: For accountability groups below the State Standard in 
science or graduation rate, the Progress Target is an alternative method for 
making AYP or qualifying for safe harbor in English language arts and 
mathematics based on improvement over the previous year's performance.  
Safe Harbor:  Safe Harbor provides an alternative means to demonstrate 
AYP for accountability groups that do not achieve their Effective AMOs in 
English or mathematics.  
Science Standard: The criterion value that represents a minimally 
satisfactory performance in science. In 2003–04, the State Science Standard 
at the elementary and middle levels was a PI of 100. The Commissioner may 
raise the State Science Standard at his discretion in future years.

Accountability Cohort: The 2000 school accountability cohort consists of all 
students who first entered grade 9 in the fall of 2000, and all ungraded 
students with disabilities who reached their seventeenth birthday in the 
2000–01 school year, who were enrolled on October 2, 2002. Students who 
transferred to programs leading to a high school diploma or high school 
equivalency diploma were not included in the 2000 school accountability 
cohort. The 2000 district accountability cohort consists of all students in each 
school accountability cohort plus students who transferred within the district 
after BEDS day plus students who were placed outside the district by the 
CSE or district administrators and who met the other requirements for cohort 
membership. Cohort is defined in Section 100.2 (p) (8) of the 
Commissioner’s Regulations. 
Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP):  Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) 
indicates satisfactory progress by a district or a school toward the goal of 
proficiency for all students.  
Annual Measurable Objective (AMO): The Annual Measurable Objective 
(AMO) is the PI value that signifies that an accountability group is making 
satisfactory progress toward the goal that 100 percent of students will be 
proficient in the State's learning standards for English language arts and 
mathematics by 2013–14. The AMO will be increased in regular increments 
beginning in 2004–05 until it reaches 200 in 2013–14.  (See Effective AMO 
for further information.) 
Continuously Enrolled Students:  Students enrolled in the school or district 
on BEDS day (usually the first Wednesday in October) of the school year and 
until the day of testing. 
Effective Annual Measurable Objective (Effective AMO):  The Effective 
Annual Measurable Objective (Effective AMO) is the PI value that each 
accountability group within a school or district is expected to achieve to make 
AYP. The Effective AMO is the lowest PI that an accountability group of a 
given size can achieve in a subject for the group’s PI not to be considered 
significantly different from the AMO for that subject. If an accountability 
group's PI equals or exceeds the Effective AMO, it is considered to have 
made AYP.  A more complete definition of Effective AMO and a table 
showing the PI values that each group size must equal or exceed to make 
AYP are available at www.emsc.nysed.gov/irts.
