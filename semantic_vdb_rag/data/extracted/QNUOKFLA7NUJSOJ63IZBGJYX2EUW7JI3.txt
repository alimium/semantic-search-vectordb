ABSTRACT 
We discuss some of the limits on the average and peak current in the 
20 TeV ring, produced by coherent .instabilities. 
We also discuss 
some effects of synchrotron radiation. 
1. 
INTRODUCTION 
We investigate the limitations on the performance of the 20 TeV proton ring due to co-
l
herent instabilities. This investigation uses a simple model 
) to describe the stability 
1imits, based on the asstunption that all low frequency instabilities, w < c/d, where d is 
the vacUlUn tank dimension, can be cured by feedback. 
To stabilize high frequency effects 
one has to rely on Landau damping. 
We discuss the limitations on the beam intensity and beam configuration obtained from 
this model. 
We also discuss some of the effects introduced by synchrotron radiation.

STABILITY CRITERIA 
As discussed in Ref. (1) we use two stability conditions, one for longitudinal effects, 
the microwave instability, and the other for transverse effects. They can be written as 
(1)

where lill/E is the beam energy spread, I is the peak current in a btmch, a. is the momentum 
p 
compaction factor, E is the beam energy, e is the electron charge, v the betatron frequency, 
R the machine radius, /).V the betatron frequency spread providing Landau damping, (Z/n)eff is 
the longitudinal coupling impedance of the btmch to the surrotmding environment and

y being the beam particle energy in rest energy lIDits, a the beam radius, d the vacuum tank 
radius and 2 0 the vacuum impedance. 
The last tenn in (3) describes the space charge effects 
and can be neglected for our 20 TeV ring. 
For a beam having B blIDches, each of length L we introduce the total longitudinal emit-
tance

In (8) we neglected the space charge contribution to the transverse impedance. 
One can see from (7), (8) that a small F

stability limit and a large FB to raise the transverse limit.

For FB < Fi we are limited by the transverse instability and for FB > F; by the longitudinal 
one. 
Of course if Fi > 1 the transverse effect is always the limiting one.

APPLICATION TO 'I1IE 20 TeV RING 
We want to evaluate (10), (11) for the 20 TeV ring. 
Since a. ::: 1/v2 there is only a 
weak dependence on v and we will only evaluate (10), (11) for the case of the 'weak focusing 
ring". 
We use the following values: 
116

2~R = 5.7 x 10~ m

v 
= 60 
a 
= 3.4 x 10-~ 
IT = 0.84 A 
Rid = 2.27 x 105 
t:.v = 0.01 
where the current corresponds to a total of 10 1 5 circulating protons. 
We obtain: 
Fi = 0.08 
at E = 1 TeV 
(12) 
and 
F* = 4 X 10- 3 
at E = 20 TeV •

Equations (10), (11) become 
(14) 
The small values of Fi mean that we are mainly limited by the longitudinal instability. 
In fact for a coasting beam at 1 TeV and for the assumed e1\ the energy spread is very small 
lillIE ::: 2.6 x 10- 5 • 
For FB = Fi = 0.08 the energy spread is increased to 3.3 x 10- ~ • 
For a total circulating current of 0.84 A we have from (14) that the effective longitu-
dinal coupling impedance must satisfy the condition 
( ~) 
$3.5Q. 
(IS) 
neff 
This condition need only be satisfied in the frequency range w ~ cld where feedback cannot 
be used. 
.An impedance of the order of a few ohm has been obtained in the electron-positron 
storage ring, PETRA.

SYNQIROTRON RADIATION EFFECTS

The synchrotron radiation energy loss per turn U0, can be obtained from
(16) 
where p is the bending radius, ro the classical proton radius and mc 2 the proton rest energy. 
For an energy of 20 TeV, y = 2.13 X 10", p = 6.68 x 10 3 m we have 
Uo = 1.82 X 105 eV •

For a total current IT = 0.84 A the radiated power is 
W = 152 kW •

The energy spread is smaller than the value detennined by the longitudinal emittance 8 II , 
which is 2.6 x 10- 5 for a coasting beam and 6.5 x 10- 3 fOT a beam with a btmching factor 
F = 4 x 10-:3 and at 20 TeV. 
Hence, according to our present tmderstanding of the microwave
B 
instability, as soon as the energy spread starts to decrease the btmch should become tmStable 
and the energy spread should remain at the value corresponding to the threshold of the in-
stability. 
The radial betatron emittance as determined by radiation alone is given by2)

and is again much smaller than the emittance at injection, E 
tV 2TI x 10- 5 m rad. 
The reduc-
x 
tion in transverse emittance produced by radiation might become important in a p-p configura-
tion, where the reduction in beam transverse size would increase the beam-beam ttme shift, 
!:lv, and the ltuninosity by a factor equal to the emittance ratio or about 1200. Again we ex-
pect that the beam-beam interaction will start to blow up the beams long before such a large 
increase is reached. 
However we can assume that the p-p system will adjust itself to the 
optimum value of !:lv. 
Also the radiation damping might be helpful in cOtmteracting slow 
diffusion processes.

CONCLUSIONS 
The results obtained in Section 3 show that coherent instabilities should not prevent 
us from reaching the design intensity of 1015 circulating protons. However to reach this 
goal one will have to use feedback to control the low frequency instabilities and to reduce 
the longitudinal coupling impedance to a few ohm. 
Also when these conditions are satisfied 
one requires a very small blll1ching factor to avoid a blow up of the longitudinal phase space. 
Of course, a much more detailed analysis will be needed when the ring is designed.

Synchrotron radiation effects are not negligible and can influence the beam properties 
in the storage configuration after a time of the order of ten hours.
